Groq is AI inference, a chip focused on large language model inference, with millisecond latency, supporting open source models such as LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma, and performance far exceeding the characteristics of GPU.
I did some researches on whether the CRMSON project can use groq. The answer is yes.
Groq cannot train models (because Groq's hardware architecture (LPU = Language Processing Unit) is designed for "extreme inference" rather than general-purpose GPUs. It is not as suitable for gradient backpropagation as A100 and H100)
But it can be used to "run/deploy" your trained models + infer new dialogues.
To this end, I have thought of two solutions (both use groq as inference)
Solution 1:
1. Use all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for word embedding and FAISS (Facebook) to find the text with the closest semantics
2. Build prompts (use a structured way to combine "background + case + task" into a clear input, and give it to LLM to understand and generate high-quality simulated dialogues or suggestions.)
prompt template example：
You are CRMSON, an AI system that simulates realistic crew communication based on aviation conflict reports.

User wants to understand how to deal with a situation involving:
[key word]

Based on the following real incident reports:
[1.    ]
[2.    ]
[3.    ]

Simulate a realistic conversation among:
- attendant
- passenger

Include:
- CRM-compliant language
- Decision making flow
- Suggestions referencing SOP/FOM where relevant

3. Call LLM to generate simulated dialogue (run on Groq) (a deployed model is required)
4. Output results

The process is
User input keywords →
Search similar cases (Embedding+FAISS) →
Build Prompt →
Call Groq for inference to generate simulated dialogue →
Front-end display/voice broadcast

Solution 2:
1.Data preprocessing (json)
2.Model fine-tuning
3. Export to Groq supported format (ONNX) (Groq uses a compiler and chip (LPU) optimized for inference,
so it requires you to convert the model into an optimizable intermediate format - ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)
4. Compile ONNX model using GroqFlow
5. Groq inference deployment
