The cleaning crew were at the front door (1Left) trying to get on the plane while the passengers were leaving; and the pilots were also trying to gather their bags and leave. This made the situation very chaotic. I was not aware of it being a 'quick-turn'; as I am always happy to try and help out with the quick-turn cleaning.The cleaners slipped on a few at a time; in between passengers leaving. I saw the two aft crewmembers with their luggage; and moving forward through the cabin; towards me. The cleaners were already onboard; cleaning throughout the plane. I said; 'last but not least!' to the final passenger; thanked her and gathered my belongings. I looked back and only saw the cleaners; and my crew who were almost to me. I didn't see any more passengers and thought we were done. I double-checked my doors and the forward lavatory and stepped off the plane. When the aft crew stepped off; there was a male passenger with them who had been mixed in with the cleaners. He did not have his boarding pass with him. He said he wouldn't leave without it; and that his seat was XX6. He wanted to go look for it himself; but crew went to look. His boarding card was found under his seat.A contributing factor is having so many people onboard/in jetbridge and the cleaning crew coming onboard (sometimes in just sweatshirts; hoodies; jackets; hats; masks; etc.) and mixing in with disembarking passengers; and vice versa.  Flights are more full now; and anyone can be mistaken for a cleaner.Other factors: double-checking the passengers haven't lowered or removed their masks; as they often do now; as they are coming down the aisle towards me and the boarding door. The passengers are trying to look down the aisle and gauge how far we've gotten with the row announcements to deplane. Also; 2-3 pilots using the lavatory; gathering bags and leaving; while passengers are disembarking causes more confusion. All of this; and the extra amount of ground-staff/cleaners onboard and in the jet-bridge in civilian clothing; causes more confusion; multitasking/load at the boarding/deplaning door.I assumed the last passenger I saw; and said goodbye to; was our final passenger onboard.I would not have stepped off the plane had I known there was still one passenger onboard.I will also alert corporate security to this incident; and the added potential for this confusion during disembarkation.,,,,Flight Attendant reported the aircraft cleaners were slipping onboard to clean the aircraft before the passengers were completely off. One last passenger; resembling a cleaner; remained intermixed with crew and cleaners during the crew's exit.,"A conflict occurred between a flight attendant (Party 1) and ground personnel (Party 2) during the disembarkation process of a flight at ZZZ airport. The incident arose due to a ""quick-turn"" operation, where the cleaning crew boarded the aircraft before all passengers had disembarked. This led to confusion as passengers, cleaning staff, and crew members were moving through the cabin simultaneously. The flight attendant was unaware of the situation escalating, as she was focused on her usual duties, including calling rows to deplane and ensuring passenger safety. During the process, she noticed the cleaning crew slipping onboard in casual attire, which blended them in with passengers and crew. Pilots were also leaving the aircraft, adding to the chaos. The flight attendant assumed all passengers had disembarked after seeing the last passenger, who resembled a cleaner, and stepped off the plane. However, a male passenger had remained onboard, intermixed with the cleaning crew and crew members. He was eventually found after his boarding pass was located under his seat. Contributing factors included the quick turnaround procedure, the lack of distinction in clothing between cleaning staff and other individuals onboard, and the presence of multiple ground staff and crew members in the jet-bridge and cabin. The flight attendant noted that double-checking passengers and crew for proper identification could help prevent such confusion in the future. She also expressed concerns about passengers removing or lowering their masks, which could further complicate the deplaning process. As a result of the incident, the flight attendant planned to alert corporate security to the situation and the potential for similar confusion during future disembarkations.",between attendant and other people

Passenger stated they were told to bring them onboard as a carry on. FA A and I were trying to accommodate the bags and were then told by the Gate Agent they were smart bags & since the battery couldn't be removed; the bags would need to come off. The pax were deplaned along with their bags. FA A stated the passengers were with us (along with their bags) on the previous flight. I did not see them board with their bags on the original flight.,,,,Air Carrier Flight Attendant reported passengers were denied boarding due to carry on smart bags with non removable batteries.,"A conflict occurred between a flight attendant and ground personnel concerning a passenger's carry-on smart bags with non-removable batteries. Passengers, traveling from ZZZ to ZZZ1, boarded an aircraft with the bags through the aft door. The flight attendant indicated the bags were too large for the overhead bins. The passengers claimed they were permitted to carry them onboard. Efforts to accommodate them were made, but the gate agent insisted the bags be checked due to safety regulations. As a result, the passengers were deplaned with their bags. The flight attendant noted the passengers had been on a previous flight but didn't observe them boarding with the bags earlier. No solution was proposed during the incident.",between attendant and other people

As soon as I went to the door I look through the peep hole and saw the gate agents eyes. I reach for the flap to open it up to pull up the two red levers and as soon as I reached for the handles the main handle started to lift up and I jerked back. I never gave the gate agent a thumbs up to say that the doors were disarmed and I never went to disarm the R1 door either.

While the flight attendant was at the door, they noticed the gate agent and attempted to open the flap. However, the main handle unexpectedly lifted, causing the flight attendant to jerk back. The flight attendant did not signal the gate agent with a thumbs-up or disarm the R1 door. The gate agent continued to pull the door, causing the slide to deploy. The flight attendant promptly informed the first officer (FO) and the captain about the incident. The B flight attendant attempted to console the affected flight attendant and advised them to take pictures and file an incident report.

He said that he was about to start coughing.  Once inside the lav; we (myself and other passengers) could hear him coughing so hard that he was gagging.  2 passengers expressed concern.  When he came out; I asked if he was feeling alright.  He told me that it was just allergies and he didn't want to start coughing in front of everyone.  Twice; during taxi; I had to ask him to put his mask back on. (Note: if someone is eating or drinking; I leave them alone.  But he was reading and/or digging through his bags.)  In flight; as soon as I went upfront; we went into the lav again after 2 more lav visits; I went back and asked him again if he was alright.  He told me that he 'Wasn't feeling well;' but that it was because he hadn't eaten breakfast. We provided everyone with snack bags and I kept an eye on him.  After several more lav trips; I called the PIC and informed him of what was going on.  The PIC asked us if we had a way of taking his temp. We said no and suggested he call for a [customer service agent] to meet the flight.  Throughout the flight; Passenger X came back to use the restroom a total of 5 times and had to be told 3 times to; please; put his mask back on.  Just after we had taken our seats for landing; he came back for a 6th time and asked me to move so that he could use the restroom.  I told him that we were about to land and that he needed to return to his seat.  He wasn't happy; but complied.  After arriving at the gate; he came back to use the lav again.  The PIC called and asked if we (the FAs) would ask him to stay seated until everyone else had deplaned so someone to talk with him.  I asked him and he was very unhappy and agreed while yanking off his mask. I must have looked surprised because; after looking back at my face; he quickly put his mask back on.  He deplaned last and a [customer service agent] was there to meet him.  The other FA informed me that; when he first boarded the plane; he had immediately used the forward restroom.  That totaled 9 trips to the lav in 1.5-2 hrs and many requests to keep his mask on.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger using the restroom numerous times; coughing and having to constantly be reminded to wear a mask.,"During a flight, a **Flight Attendant (FA)** reported an incident involving a passenger, referred to as Passenger X, who exhibited unusual behavior. Passenger X used the restroom a total of **nine times** within a span of **1.5 to 2 hours**, which raised concerns among the crew and other passengers. Upon entering the restroom, Passenger X was heard coughing heavily, to the point of gagging, which worried two other passengers. When asked about his condition, he initially claimed it was due to allergies but later stated he was not feeling well because he had not eaten breakfast. The FA provided snack bags to all passengers and kept a close eye on Passenger X throughout the flight. Additionally, Passenger X was repeatedly reminded to wear his mask properly. The FA noted that he was reading or digging through his bags, which may have contributed to the need for mask reminders. The FA informed the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) about the situation, and the PIC requested that the FA check if there was a way to take Passenger X's temperature. Since the crew did not have a thermometer, the PIC suggested contacting a customer service agent to meet the flight. After landing, the PIC instructed the FA to ask Passenger X to remain seated until all other passengers had deplaned, so that someone could speak with him privately. Passenger X complied but was visibly unhappy and removed his mask in frustration. After noticing the FA's surprise, he quickly put the mask back on. Passenger X was the last to deplane and was met by a customer service agent at the gate. The FA later reported that Passenger X had used the forward restroom immediately after boarding the plane, adding to the total of nine restroom visits. His behavior created disturbances and safety concerns during the flight.",between attendant and other people

The Gate Agent had not briefed the flight attendants on any exemptions; so I looked on EFB and just saw an Infant in XX3. I asked the Forward FA to ask the Gate Agent who was standing in the galley if we had any late exemptions and he advised no. Gate Agent came to back of plane to talk to Passenger X and advised him he would have to wear a mask since there was not an exemption. Passenger X advised he had gotten an exemption in ZZZ1 on way to ZZZ and showed a boarding pass that in ink was written exemption from mask but we had no idea who wrote it. Passenger X then pulled out a letter that only stated he was disabled and that he gets paid a certain amount. Gate Agent was advising it was OK with him for Passenger X to go; but I said no we need to talk to the Captain in regards to this. We went to the Captain who made a phone call and was told passenger would need to get an exemption for our flight. The Gate Agent at that time went to gate to meet a Supervisor and see if anything was in the record. When he came back suddenly there was a record for the passenger with the exemption of taking mask off for XX minute intervals. I then looked at my EFB and now it showed a wheelchair where the infant had been and the infant moved to XX4. We closed up after advising Passenger X of the exemption and the XX minutes only. During the 2 hour 30 minute flight we had to tell Passenger X at least 4 times that he had to put mask on and when he did we had to tell him over his nose and mouth not just his chin. Passenger also had a very disruptive 2 yr old as well; that was coughing and sneezing and Passenger X advised us his children gave him high anxiety and that was why he could not wear mask.Passenger X's total disregard of mask rule and even though he got [an] exemption to take mask off for XX minute intervals he did not follow the exemption.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger would not comply with the face mask policy even though the passenger had a special exemption to take it off for periods at a time.,"During a flight, a passenger (Passenger X) assigned to seat XX3 refused to comply with the face mask policy despite being granted a special exemption to remove the mask for brief intervals. The incident began when the flight attendant noticed Passenger X without a mask during boarding. The Gate Agent, who had not briefed the flight crew on any exemptions, initially denied knowing about one. Passenger X presented a boarding pass with an ink-written exemption and a letter stating his disability. Despite the Gate Agent's initial approval, the flight attendant insisted on consulting the Captain, who confirmed that an exemption was needed specifically for the flight. The Gate Agent then retrieved a record confirming the exemption, allowing Passenger X to remove the mask for short periods. However, during the 2.5-hour flight, Passenger X repeatedly ignored the mask policy, often only covering his chin instead of his nose and mouth. Compounding the issue, Passenger X's disruptive two-year-old child coughed and sneezed throughout the flight, and Passenger X cited anxiety as a reason for non-compliance. Despite the exemption, Passenger X showed total disregard for the mask rules, requiring multiple reminders from the flight crew. An exemption was granted for Passenger X to remove the mask for specified intervals. However, Passenger X failed to adhere to the exemption, leading to repeated reminders and non-compliance during the flight.",between attendant and other people

The high temp was close to 100 degrees. Knowing this; I left a little early to make sure I could get to the aircraft early and ensure that it was cooled down before we began boarding. I got to the aircraft 62 minutes prior to our schedule push time. The aircraft was closed up; mobile bridge pulled and the vent flap on the main cabin door was opened. There was no external air hooked up. I proceeded to power up the aircraft and noted the cabin temp was reporting as 38 Celsius or 101 Fahrenheit. We had not yet been fueled; so I opted to start the APU to get air flowing and then made a call on the radio to Ops to get external air and AC connected in hopes it would happen before the fuel arrived and I would have to power down the APU. In the meantime; I personally walked through the cabin and opened each overhead gasper to maximize the airflow. Most of them were mostly or completely closed. About 5 minutes later; the fueler showed up; but there was still no external power or air connected. I told the fueler that I would prefer to wait until at least the external AC was hooked up since I had already 'set up' the aircraft FMS. As I was talking to the fueler; a ramp agent showed up; started the GPU and plugged in the cable. He then proceeded to walk to the gate next door. After getting back into the flight deck; I noticed that the external AC was not available. The same ramp agent was walking by the main cabin door at that point and I asked him to check the connection on the AC power as well as hook up the external air. He told me that he needed a lead to hook up the air; which was news to me. I called Ops again on the radio and requested a lead to hook up the air. About this time; the fueler had finished and I started up the APU again. Soon after; the gate agent came out to ask if we were ready to board. The FA (Flight Attendant) and I both agreed that the cabin was too warm to board right then; so we told them that we would wait and try to get the cabin a little cooler before we boarded. About 5 minutes prior to the normal boarding time (D-30); a ramp agent came up front and asked if we needed the external air hooked up. I told him that we had the APU running now and didn't need it anymore - note this was at least 30 minutes after I originally asked for air to be hooked up. Right at the regular boarding time (D-25); the cabin temp had shown a decreasing trend; down to 36 Celsius and the FA said she was comfortable boarding. We boarded up and pushed back on time. After arrival in ZZZ1 and walking to the van; the FA made a comment about how she 'shouldn't have done this' and that she had had trouble focusing and making her announcements because of the high cabin temperature. She made no mention of this to us until we were in ZZZ1. Flight Ops was asked multiple times to connect external air to help cool the cabin on an aircraft that was on the ground for nearly 10 hours in the sun and close to 100 degree temperatures. I was hoping that there would have been air hooked up at some point during that time period to help alleviate the heat issue in the cabin; of which the CRJ-200 is notorious for. While I felt that the cabin was noticeably cooler before we began to board; it was still fairly warm. I ultimately deferred to the FA as to whether or not she was comfortable boarding since she was the one that would be back there for the entirety of the flight. Maybe it was self-imposed pressure to try and get out on time or not cancel the flight that led her (and to a lesser extent; myself) to board before we should have. The FA did mention (multiple times) that she had picked up the trip so she could get to ZZZ2 the next morning from ZZZ.[I believe] there is no reason why an aircraft that is parked for 10 hours in high heat and direct sunlight is not hooked up to external air to cool the cabin. Even so; it shouldn't take 30 minutes to get someone out to the aircraft to hook it up after I call multiple times; especially after I advise them that we can't board until the cabin is cooled down. There really should be some kind of system in place for aircraft that are on the ground for an extended period to ensure that they are hooked up to external air at some point well prior to departure. On a day like this; I would think at least 90 minutes prior to departure would be prudent. In hindsight; I also could have coordinated with the regional controller and possibly swapped into a different aircraft.,,,,CRJ Captain reported issues getting cabin cooled before boarding. A Flight Attendant suggested they boarded too early.,"The incident involved a CRJ-200 aircraft experiencing difficulty in cooling its cabin before departure. The captain reported that the aircraft had been parked on the ground for over 10 hours in high temperatures, with the cabin temperature reaching 38°C (101°F). The captain made multiple requests to ground personnel to connect external cooling systems, but these were delayed. Despite starting the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and opening overhead gaspers to circulate air, the cabin remained warm. Approximately 30 minutes after the captain initially requested external air, a ramp agent connected the external cooling system. At the scheduled boarding time, the cabin temperature had decreased to 36°C (96.8°F), and the flight attendant felt comfortable boarding. The flight departed on time, but the flight attendant later expressed discomfort due to the high cabin temperature, which she believed impaired her ability to focus on her duties. The incident highlighted the challenges of cooling aircraft parked for extended periods in high temperatures and the need for improved communication and response protocols between flight crews and ground personnel to address such issues promptly. The captain suggested that a system should be in place to ensure external cooling is connected well in advance of departure, particularly for aircraft like the CRJ-200, which are more susceptible to heat-related comfort issues.",between attendant and other people

I explained they needed to wait for passengers to get off and the cleaners became very combative saying that they were following their protocol. The cleaner took off his mask to reprimand the D Flight Attendant after I pointed out their actions weren't safe. Furthermore; we have an hour and a half on the ground so such haste is not necessary. The practice of cleaners barging onboard and swimming upstream during deplaning is not safe and makes it even more impossible to socially distance.   Cleaners in ZZZ need to be reminded to give passengers space upon deplaning. The practice of coming onboard immediately after the L1 door opens needs to be stopped. Cleaners should also be reminded to leave their masks on when interacting with flight attendants.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that cleaners were barging onboard and 'swimming' upstream while passengers were trying to deplane.,"The incident occurred at ZZZ, where a conflict arose between a flight attendant and ground personnel (cleaners). The flight attendant reported that cleaners entered the aircraft prematurely, before passengers had fully deplaned, disrupting the deplaning process and compromising social distancing measures. The flight attendant instructed the cleaners to wait until passengers had disembarked, but they refused, citing adherence to their protocol. During the exchange, a cleaner removed his mask, prompting further concern. The flight attendant emphasized that the cleaners' actions were unnecessary given the ample ground time (one and a half hours) available.

I was C; and could not see the seat from where I was standing in the exit row; and did not notice the passengers placing it during boarding.  I was busy greeting passengers as they walked through; and telling people who sat in the exit row that they were seated in the exit row; and verifying they were willing to sit there.  One woman was not responding to me; and I realized she could not hear me.  She said her ears were blocked from the last landing; and they had not cleared. Since she was unable to hear or respond to my questions; I told her I would have to re-seat her.  A gentleman in the exit row loudly said she was sick; and should not be allowed on the plane.  I asked her if she was sick; and she said no.  She appeared to be congested; which is likely the reason her ears blocked on landing.  I had her trade seats with another passenger; briefed the exit row and secured the forward cabin from the exit row forward.  When I got to the front; I informed A the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure.  I did not hear a PA that the aft cabin was secure. I informed the A that the woman I moved from the exit row could not hear; that she was congested but said she was not sick.  The A said she did not appear sick or have any COVID symptoms when she boarded. I said congestion could be a COVID symptom; and A seemed surprised; and said she never heard that.  By then operations was in front with us; and he and A said all I was required to do was ask if they are sick; and if the response is no; then we leave it alone.  I did not know if the passenger had allergies; a cold; or something more serious.The A was doing her final walk through prior to takeoff; and noticed a child seat directly behind the exit row. Someone notified the Captain; and A and D quickly had passengers change rows. The captain rang; I answered; and he asked if they were finished. I said I was C in front; and they were not quite done. He asked to be notified; and a few seconds later I let him know the exchange was complete.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger that sat in the exit row had hearing problems and was displaying symptoms of possibly being sick.,"During a pre-takeoff safety check, the flight attendant (Party1) noticed a child seat positioned directly behind the exit row. While conducting her duties, she was occupied with greeting passengers and ensuring that those seated in the exit row were willing to assume the responsibilities of that seat. A passenger in the exit row exhibited hearing difficulties, as she was unable to respond to the flight attendant's instructions. The passenger explained that her ears were blocked due to a prior landing, leading to congestion but not indicating that she was sick. The flight attendant attempted to reseat the passenger in accordance with safety protocols, but a gentleman seated nearby objected, claiming the passenger was sick and should not be on the plane. The passenger denied being sick, though her congestion raised concerns about potential COVID-19 symptoms. The flight attendant consulted with the captain and operations, who advised her that if the passenger was not explicitly sick or exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, she could remain on the plane. The flight attendant proceeded with reseating the passenger and securing the forward cabin. The incident was resolved after the flight attendant successfully completed the seat change and informed the captain that the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure.

There were 2 cockpit jumpseat riders. I; as Captain; heard the verbal request for clearance to close the entry door. I was unable to turn my head around to see; but I heard the request; and we were ready to close the entry door; so I stated that it was okay to close the door. The door subsequently closed; and we went on our way to ZZZ1. After the entry door was closed; but prior to closing the cockpit door; the Number 1 Flight Attendant advised me that the door had been closed by the agent without her permission. I told her what had happened; and we noted that there had been a miscommunication. After the flight; in ZZZ1 during the debrief; we noted that the agent should not have closed the door without talking to the Number 1 Flight Attendant. Also noted was the fact that due to the busy and crowded flight deck; and the difficulty for me to turn around; and see if the person asking if it was clear to close; I apparently had given clearance to close to the agent and not the Flight Attendant. We agreed that agent was in the wrong to have closed the door without coordinating with the Number 1 Flight Attendant.Agent closed the door without the consent of the Number 1 Flight Attendant. This occurred because the agent failed to follow the correct procedure. The Flight Attendant is supposed to close the door; not the agent.Agents need to be trained that they must have the Number 1 Flight Attendant there to close the entry door. Pilots should make every effort to see that the person they are giving clearance to close is the Number 1 Flight Attendant and not the agent; although; as I stated this can be difficult to do at times with a busy crowded cockpit and doorway. The most important thing is that the agents not close the door without the Flight Attendant.,,,,A319-100 Captain reported the gate CSR did not follow company policy during the final passenger boarding procedures.,"The incident involved a miscommunication during the final boarding procedures of an A319-100 flight, where the entry door was closed by ground personnel without the consent of the Number 1 Flight Attendant. The pilot, unable to visually confirm who was requesting clearance due to a busy cockpit, assumed it was the Flight Attendant and granted permission. However, it was later discovered that the ground agent had closed the door, violating company policy, which mandates that the Flight Attendant must authorize such actions. During the post-flight debrief, it was determined that the ground personnel were at fault for not coordinating with the Flight Attendant. The crew acknowledged the challenge pilots face in confirming identities in a crowded cockpit. To prevent future occurrences, it was agreed that ground personnel should be trained to follow proper procedures and wait for the Flight Attendant's authorization before closing the door. Additionally, pilots were encouraged to make every effort to confirm the identity of the person requesting clearance, highlighting the importance of clear communication protocols. This incident underscores the need for enhanced training and communication to ensure adherence to company policies, emphasizing the crucial role of the Flight Attendant in such procedures.",between attendant and other people

I was given a shuttle to the maintenance hangar to get onboard. When the FO and I had everything ready; I opened my window to speak with the ground agent standing outside. He said he had never towed from here before; and he didn't have a headset or wing-walkers. We were parked tightly at an angle between other things; so I asked him if he could get a headset and helpers. I also called maintenance to see if they could send someone out to help the guy. Finally; [the ground agent] came back with a headset and helpers; and he was fabulous about getting us pulled out. We flew to ZZZ and landed just after midnight. We landed and were cleared to the gate. As we were about to turn left; an airport bus almost drove right in front of us going westbound along the road. I hit the brakes. He stopped; but he stopped too close for me to go past him. I flashed all my lights at him and we told ground about that happened. The vehicle behind the bus flashed lights several times. We all needed him to back up but he didn't get it. Then he gunned it and drove right in front of us. We told ground; and I called the tower to clarify the details after landing. The bus was a blue and white design. When we arrived at [the] gate; the agent had positioned the jetway and then left. So we had to wait about 15 minutes for an agent to come and let us out of the jetway in order to avoid setting off security alarms. Make sure bus drivers on the ground know that they should give way to aircraft.,,,,An aircraft Captain reported he had to abruptly apply the brakes to avoid a bus driving in front of the aircraft.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and ground personnel during aircraft operations. The flight attendant reported being sent messages about a reassignment to an empty airplane and subsequent flights. While preparing for departure, the flight attendant communicated with a ground agent who lacked necessary equipment (headset and wing-walkers) and experience in towing the aircraft from the location. After resolving this initial issue with the help of maintenance, the flight attendant proceeded to ZZZ, landing just after midnight. Upon landing and taxiing to the gate, the flight attendant encountered a near-accident when an airport bus failed to yield, nearly driving in front of the aircraft. The flight attendant had to apply brakes abruptly to avoid collision. Despite communication with ground personnel and the tower, the bus driver did not comply, creating a safety hazard. The aircraft was eventually positioned at the gate, but the ground agent left the jetway unattended, requiring a 15-minute wait for assistance to avoid triggering security alarms. The flight attendant recommended that ground personnel, particularly bus drivers, be informed to yield to aircraft to prevent similar incidents.",between attendant and other people

First passenger was seated in 8C with cabin pet in carryon kennel. Second passenger was 25A with small dog tucked under her coat. First Animal; [seat] 8: [The] dog remained in kennel for entire flight and did not cause disruptions. However; what caught my attention during boarding was passenger had to swap seats (at my recommendation) with 9D due to 8C's kennel unable to fit under her seat. The kennel was blocked due to the IFE power box under 8C. It should also be noted that PETC [Pet in Cabin] was not discovered as undocumented until inflight; thus ZZZ ground staff was not alerted about this animal prior to departure.Second animal [seat] 25A: Requested [passenger's] seat number as she boarded since I had not noted no pets on the Special Services List during preflight briefing. As boarding continued; I refreshed my Flight Attendant tablet to check if passengers with dogs were a last minute add to the manifest. However [passenger] was checked-in but no reference to ESA or SVAN [Emotional Support Animals and Service] on The Tablet seat map. Also; [I] referenced a fresh copy of the Special Services list no documentation.  I then contacted the female gate agent via phone and advised that we had a passenger with an undocumented cabin pet aboard while providing seat assignment. Prior to door closure; I witnessed [customer service representative] come onboard and question [the passenger].  I overheard him asked what type of service passenger's animal provided. The passenger responded; but I was unable to hear her answer. Later noted after landing that passenger's PNR had been updated reflecting her dog was a medic alert animal -- thus making it a SVAN. However; the dog had no exterior badging; vest; harness; or leash to keep the animal under control during the flight. The passenger simply cradled the dog in her arms during the flight.  As noted in the FA Inflight Manual; SVAN are to remain on leash or harness under passengers control at all times for safety.The main focus of this report is to express extreme concern on how two animals: 1 PETC and 1 SVAN were permitted to board the flight completely undetected by the ZZZ ground staff. Of even greater concern; PETC was in cabin kennel during the boarding process thus clearly visible to agents working the flight. Further; SVAN was permitted in the cabin without the correct restraint thus creating an injury risk to passengers and crew.Report filed due to personal safety/injury risk to passengers/crew with dog permitted to board without proper restraint requirements (leash/harness/vest). It also appears this animal was not correctly documented as a SVAN due to last minute add to PNR.,,,,B737-800 Flight Attendant reported 2 dogs being brought onboard without proper paperwork or notification from the gate agent.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party 1) and ground personnel (Party 2) regarding two passengers boarding a B737-800 aircraft with dogs that were not properly documented or restrained. During boarding, the flight attendant observed a passenger in seat 8C with a pet in a carry-on kennel and another passenger in seat 25A with a small dog under her coat. The first dog remained in the kennel for the entire flight without causing disruptions, but the passenger had to swap seats due to the kennel being blocked by an IFE power box under seat 8C. The second dog, later identified as an emotional support animal (ESA), was not documented as such on the passenger's manifest or special services list. Although the passenger was checked in, there was no reference to the ESA or service animal (SVAN) on the flight attendant's tablet or the special services list. The flight attendant notified the gate agent about the undocumented ESA and observed a customer service representative boarding the aircraft to inquire about the animal. After the flight, it was discovered that the passenger's PNR had been updated to reflect the dog as a SVAN, but the animal was not properly restrained, as required by safety protocols, and lacked any visible identification or control gear. The flight attendant expressed concern over the lack of proper documentation and restraint, which posed a safety risk to passengers and crew. The report was filed to address the safety risk associated with the un restrained animal and the failure to properly document the ESA. The flight attendant recommended improving communication and compliance with documentation and restraint requirements to prevent similar incidents in the future.",between attendant and other people

Subsequently the slide pack dislodged fell part way from door. I grabbed the door to stop further deployment and told agent to back away. I then called captain and told him of situation. He instructed me to get everyone away for safety and came out to assist. He took over my place holding the door and had station personnel call for maintenance. He calmly let passengers know what was happening and remained at door until slide pack was removed to a safe distance and we could deplane passengers.Background of the day and offered as an explanation and not as an excuse; for the fault lies with myself.Several things happened that day to not only distract my focus but also to degrade my physical condition and awareness which led to my subsequent failure.On [a flight] earlier that same day when responding to someone hitting their flight attendant call light repeatedly while I was seated I stood up from jump seat to see what was required. They had turned it off by then and when I went to sit back down in my jump seat it had returned to its spring loaded upright position and instead of sitting in my jump seat I fell to the floor. The rest of the day was filled with discomfort as a result. I tried to fill out an incident report immediately however I was made to understand from the company website that I would need to use an actual computer as the reports were not supported by my handheld device. Dwelling on that and actively trying to physically avoid my number three as he was not feeling well and I didn't want to come down with something as I was already starting to feel unwell. The last few days had included many days of long flight hours and between the physical and mental strain of that and the stress of starting to get sick; I initiated actions that led to the incident.Specifically at the time of the incident I initiated all call procedures to disarm doors and deplane passengers. The flight attendants 2; 3; and 4 all accomplished their disarming per policy. At this time I also realized that the carts needed sealing with blue liquor seals.My door however was still armed. At that point; my number 3 flight attendant pointed to my door and in an attempt to shake me from my non focused state firmly said; 'you need to disarm your door.' I acknowledged him; turned towards my door and immediately gave the thumbs up for the station agent to open door 1L even though it was in the armed position.Between all the issues fighting for my focus at that time; I did not personally use the appropriate disarming procedures including monitor and challenge on my door even after I had crosschecked door 1R.I obviously did not have my focus where it belonged. I was hurting; trying to keep from getting more sick and feeling the effects of fatigue after several long flight hour days. While all of these things are true; the door was opened and slide fell out because I incorrectly initiated the process.I understand the importance of monitor and challenge procedures and I let my pain; distraction and illness take away my focus. The reality of the situation and the danger I put the station agent in is a big reality check that I will not soon forget. My job; when opening or closing a door always involves the monitor and challenge procedures and I intent to always make sure to using them completely to always succeed in my job when opening and closing aircraft doors.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported that the entry door slide was not disarmed when customer service attempted to open the door.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and ground personnel (Party2) during aircraft operations. The flight attendant opened the 1L door of a 737 aircraft in the armed position after receiving a thumbs-up signal from the station agent. This caused the slide pack to dislodge and partially deploy. The flight attendant immediately grabbed the door to prevent further deployment, instructed the agent to step back, and informed the captain. The captain assumed control, ensuring passenger safety, communicating the situation to passengers, and coordinating with maintenance. The slide pack was eventually removed, and passengers were safely deplaned. The incident was attributed to the flight attendant's failure to follow proper disarm procedures, including the monitor and challenge protocol, due to physical and mental fatigue, discomfort, and distractions from prior incidents during the day. The flight attendant acknowledged the lapse in focus and expressed intent to adhere strictly to procedures in the future. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further complications.",between attendant and other people

I was working in A position on the aircraft; a sold out flight with two jump seats occupied. A pre-boarding Customer was listed on my specials report as having a vision impairment and having a working assistance animal. I met the Customer in the jetbridge and offered my assistance; to which he refused. The Customer's service animal appeared to be a full sized golden lab.The Customer proceeded to sit in a bulkhead row aisle seat on this aircraft. I informed the Customer that he would need to sit in the window seat so that his service animal would not hinder the egress of Customers sitting outboard of him. The Customer informed me that he was not going to move to the window seat; that he knew his rights and that he had every right to sit in the aisle seat and that he didn't have to occupy the window seat if he didn't want too. He informed me that his dog was not going to be in the aisle and would not obstruct the aisle. I explained to him that the aisle was not my greatest concern; that the animal was in fact obstructing access to the aisle for the two yet to be occupied seats. The Customer still refused to move. Sensing that the customer was going to be difficult to deal with; I simply replied with; 'Ok' and continued with the boarding process.I pulled out my EFAM (Flight Attendant Manual) and conducted a search to make sure that I was in-line with [Company] policies and procedures. I also asked assistance from my B to help with the search so I could face my customers as they boarded the aircraft. Our search quickly found what we were looking for. [In the FAM] it stipulates that an assistance animal 'May not obstruct an aisle or access to an aisle.'  I informed a ramp agent in the jetbridge that I would need a representative to address the situation and they informed my Ops Agent. I informed my Captain of the situation.Boarding was complete and I still didn't have a representative. Ops Agent again called and Ops Supervisor came to assist. I explained the situation to Ops Sup and Captain and showed them the aforementioned FAM requirements for assistance animals. Captain reviewed the FAM for several minutes to ensure there was no grey area around the policies and procedures. We as a team; all 4 Flight Attendants; our Captain; our Ops Agent and our Ops Supervisor all found ourselves in agreement that the Customer with the assistance animal would need to sit in the window seat in order to meet our safety regulations. Ops Sup was tasked with engaging the Customer with the assistance animal and asking him to swap seats to the window seat. Ops Sup explained everything to the Customer and was rejected just as I was; but this time with all the seats full of Customers; Ops Sup found himself at the end of the stick. Customers who had no reason to be engaged in the conversation with Ops Sup found themselves yelling at Ops Sup; telling him that the disabled Customer had rights and that he didn't have to move if he didn't want too. Ops Sup left the aircraft and made a call to Customer Service to get their stance on the conflict. They backed the direction of the FAM and crew and directed Ops Sup to again ask the Customer with the assistance animal to move one last time or to remove him from the flight for non-compliance with safety regulations. Again; Ops Sup engaged the Customer and the Customer refused to move. He even said that he wasn't getting off the aircraft; period. With that Ops Sup was left with only one option; to call the police and have the Customer physical removed from the aircraft for his refusal to comply with the required safety regulations. After 10 minutes of waiting for the police; Ops Sup called the police again as they still hadn't shown up. The Customers in the row tried repeatedly to get the Customer with the assistance animal to move to the window seat but he refused. Everyonejust wanted to get the flight under way.After nearly 30 minutes the Customer with the assistance animal finally agreed to take the window seat; at the convincing of the Customers in his row. He was angry and told everyone that this was going to be their last day on the job. He stated that he wasn't going to leave the [arrival] airport until he had received justice for the injustices against him. The police never showed up. During the flight the Customer showed no aggression and other than using the forward lavatory three times; stayed in the window seat. He had a Jack and Coke which I comped. Upon arrival; the Ops Agent approached me regarding a known difficult Customer. I gave him the rundown of what happened so that he could alert his leadership team. The Customer and his supporters did in fact give the Customer Service and Ops team a difficult time in the gate area. Leadership informed the Customer that he needed to get in touch with Customer Service.Customers need to abide by the required safety regulations; including Customers with disabilities. Maybe the ACAA (Air Carrier Access Act) could assist the airlines and their members by informing their members of what they can do to avoid conflict on an aircraft and how follow the safety regulations that airlines must enforce. As for flight crews; everyone must be on the same page in enforcing the safety regulations. When one crew lets safety slide; the rest of us hear about it from the Customers.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported an encounter with a visually handicapped; dog-assisted passenger who refused a window seat thus failing to comply with company aisle obstruction regulations. The passenger voluntarily moved to a window seat after a threatened removal from the flight.,"The incident involved a visually impaired passenger with a service dog on a sold-out flight. The flight attendant requested the passenger to move to a window seat to prevent obstruction of aisle access, as per company policies. The passenger refused, citing his rights, leading to a prolonged delay as the crew and supervisors attempted to resolve the issue. The situation escalated when the police were threatened with being called, though they didn't arrive. Eventually, other passengers persuaded the man to move, allowing the flight to proceed. The passenger remained agitated but compliant. Post-landing, he caused a scene, prompting leadership to direct him to contact customer service. The flight attendant suggested that the ACAA could aid in educating passengers to prevent such conflicts, emphasizing the need for consistent enforcement of safety regulations.",between attendant and other people

I made appropriate periodic PAs to Passengers. Our wheels up was :50 so I told Agent and Crew to plan to push at :40. At push time no one was ready. I had to go to the top of the jet way to find the Agent and there was no Pushback Crew. As a result we were rushed despite the 50 minute delay. At this point there was a serious chance that we would not make our wheels up time. At the last moment the A Flight Attendant tossed the napkin on to the console and closed the cockpit door. The last digit of the count was illegible and I made the mistake of assuming it was correct. As we approached the runway we were cleared for immediate takeoff. I rang the cabin to notify the Flight Attendants and as we took the runway the A called up to tell us that there was a Passenger that thought he might be on the wrong aircraft. I had the First Officer instruct everyone to remain seated and that we would sort it out in the air. Above 10;000 feet I confirmed the load sheet count of 46 and compared it to the napkin count of 4 (illegible). I contacted the A who said her count was 47. Further investigation revealed that our extra Passenger was a connect for [a different airport] that had failed to exit at the last stop and remained on the aircraft despite the numerous PAs referring to our destination. I suspect that he was in the lav during the through count process. We coordinated with Dispatch to have a [customer service agent] meet him.Slow down; it's always wise to slow down. Also; our procedure of verifying the count as the very last thing to occur before push; seems like there could be a better time to discover this showstopper; especially when faced with a potentially significant delay if an error is detected. Maybe I haven't been paying attention but I ride other airlines and I've never seen flight attendants actually count Passengers before pushback. The potential error chain has too many links with our system.,,[Report narrative contained no additional information.],,B737NG flight crew reported they departed with an unaccounted passenger onboard.,"The incident arose from a miscount of passengers during the boarding process, resulting in an unaccounted extra passenger on board. The flight experienced a 50-minute gate hold after boarding was complete. Despite periodic passenger announcements, the pushback was delayed due to unprepared staff and missing pushback crew. At pushback, the flight attendant provided an illegible passenger count, leading the captain to assume the count was correct. Takeoff was approved, and the cabin was notified. Shortly after taking the runway, the flight attendant reported a passenger concerned about being on the wrong aircraft. The captain instructed everyone to remain seated and planned to address the issue in flight. Upon reaching 10,000 feet, the load sheet showed 46 passengers, while the flight attendant's count was 47. The discrepancy revealed an extra passenger, a connecting passenger who had not exited at the previous stop, found in the lavatory during the count. The crew coordinated with dispatch to have a customer service agent meet the passenger at the destination. The flight had to divert to resolve the issue, causing delays and operational challenges. The extra passenger was offloaded, and the aircraft was prepared for the next leg. The captain suggested revising the passenger counting procedure, possibly conducting counts earlier or more thoroughly to prevent such errors, noting that other airlines may handle this process differently. This incident highlights the importance of accurate passenger counting and the potential benefits of revising current procedures to minimize errors.",between attendant and other people

The ramp agent was right behind her with the pink sheet. We compared the manifest to the pink sheet and entered the numbers for the solution. We overheard the FA talking with the gate agent about missing 30 people. I asked the agent to come forward and explained to her that it's still 10 minutes before departure time. Please go back up the jetway and make sure there's not a bunch of passengers up there trying to get on the flight. We're not going to leave people behind while the door is still open. As this conversation concluded another FA came forward to share his perception. He stated; quite emphatically; 'there's NO WAY that count is right... there are WAY more than 90 people on this aircraft.' He said he was going to do a head count. I thought that sounded like a good idea. As it turns out there were 127 passengers on board; not 90. I walked up the jetway to talk to the agent and calmly explained to her; 'there is obviously a meaningful discrepancy in the passenger count that will need to be reconciled before departure.' That process took about an hour.The passenger count cannot be trusted at this airport. All flights should require a head count to compare to the passenger manifest.,,,,A320 Captain reported that the passenger manifest was incorrect by over 30 people.,"The incident involved a discrepancy in the passenger manifest for an A320 flight. During the boarding process, the ground personnel noticed that the manifest reported 90 passengers, but the actual number of passengers on the aircraft was 127, a difference of over 30 people. The ground personnel raised concerns with the flight attendant, emphasizing the need to resolve the issue before departure. A head count was conducted at the suggestion of another flight attendant, confirming the discrepancy. The ground personnel then informed the gate agent about the mismatch and suggested implementing a standardized head count procedure for all flights at the airport to prevent similar issues in the future. The resolution process took approximately one hour, and the flight eventually departed after the discrepancy was addressed.",between attendant and other people

We had 127 PAX onboard. (FA name) was assisting the non-English speaking woman with the infant in row one. I went through the cabin looking for 2 seats together. I made a PA to PAX; asking for volunteers to move. I went to the back of the aircraft to help (FA name) find two seats together. As I was going back up to the front looking for bin space for their carryon bags I saw the FWD entry door closed. The woman with the toddler was standing in the aisle with 3 bags on the floor because we could not get anyone to move. I asked (FA name) why the door was closed. She told me the OPS agent closed the door. I reopened the door as the cabin was not secure. I made another PA asking for people to move. Two PAX were volunteering to move. I was assisting them in moving. When I started towards the front of the aircraft I saw that the forward entry door was again closed. I opened the door again. I then went into the jet way. Going back into the cabin the OPS agent for the third time; shut the door. (FA name) told me that she told the OPS agent that we could not close the door until the cabin was secured. I went into the jet way and said to the OPS agent; 'I don't know if you are aware of the FAR; but we cannot close the FWD entry door until all PAX are seated and all bags are stowed'; She said; 'Well; shut your mouth; get on the plane and mind your own business'; while shooing me with her hands. I walked onto the threshold of the aircraft with my back facing the FWD entry door and she let the door fall into the cabin. The door was so close it grazed my hair. I went into the cockpit and told the Captain I wanted to speak to a Supervisor. When the Supervisor arrived I told him what happened. The OPS agent told the Supervisor that the wind blew the door closed. With 100% certainty; I know that the FWD door was flush against the fuselage and the gust lock was securing the door. I told the Supervisor and the OPS agent that I believed she did it intentionally. (FA name) told the Supervisor that I spoke to the agent respectfully prior to her letting the door fall in the cabin. (FA name) also told the Supervisor that the agent did the same thing to her as she was bending down to make a PA and the she had to dodge the door to keep it from hitting her head.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that the Operations Agent insisted on closing the aircraft's main cabin door while passengers were still standing. Ground Ops Supervisor was called to rectify the situation.,"The incident occurred between a flight attendant (Party1) and ground personnel (Party2) during the boarding process of a flight with 127 passengers. The flight attendant was assisting a non-English speaking woman with an infant and needed to find two adjacent seats for the family. Despite making multiple announcements requesting volunteers to move, the flight attendant faced difficulties in securing the cabin. During this time, the ground personnel (OPS agent) repeatedly closed the forward entry door before the cabin was fully secured, disregarding the flight attendant's instructions to wait until all passengers were seated and bags stowed. The OPS agent dismissed the flight attendant's concerns and even shooed her away, causing the door to nearly hit her. The flight attendant reported the incident to the captain, who then summoned a Ground Operations Supervisor. The OPS agent claimed the door closed due to wind, but the flight attendant and another crew member disputed this, stating the door was manually closed. The situation was ultimately resolved with the supervisor's intervention.",between attendant and other people

When I returned to the Cockpit to start back to my flight Duties; I was informed from the acting Copilot that they had dealt with an unintentional None Crew Person entry into the Cockpit.  Although shocked; after listening to how it had happened I could see how it might have been able to.  The Flight Attendant misunderstood the FO's request to tell his son that they were passing near Greenland for him to take a look.   When I later went back for a washroom break just prior to the landing at ORD; I also talked with the Flight Attendant about his required procedures with the entry into the Cockpit and the Cockpit Door opening. Also reminded him if he ever felt that a request of that nature is what he heard; he best clarify and to just speak up and ask if that was what was asked of him.  Also knowing his responsibilities and training; to just refuse such a request. Had he just asked to clarify; or refused the request none of this would have happened.,,We were at cruise during the second portion of the scheduled pilot break. The Captain was on his break and myself and the relief FO were in the cockpit. As we were approaching Greenland; I called the forward galley to inform Flight Attendant that the weather ahead was nice with good visibility; since he had asked me earlier if we were going to be able to see Greenland. He asked if he could come up to the cockpit. I told him that would be fine; since this would give me an opportunity to take a lavatory break after he came to the cockpit. He said he would call back when the area was clear and he would be ready. The relief FO then called back to the forward flight attendant station and asked whoever it was that answered the phone if they would inform his son who was riding in the cabin that he look outside his window to see Greenland. Subsequently; the Flight Attendant called to say he was ready and would be at the door. I then went to the door and looked out the door viewing port. It was dark outside the door; but I could see his face as he was close to the door. I didn't see anyone else; as the son was much shorter. I then opened the door and stepped back. At that point; the son had already stepped in and the Flight Attendant was following him into the cockpit. As the door was closing behind them; I recalled our security training which emphasized keeping the door open as short a time as possible (three seconds ideally) and realized the safest thing to do was to close the door and sort it out with the cockpit secure. We then called back to confirm the area was still secure and arranged to have them exit the cockpit as quickly as possible. After discussing the error; it appears to have been a misunderstanding about bringing the boy to the cockpit versus pointing out the view.,,A B767 crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit in flight.,"The incident involved an unintended breach of cockpit security on a B767 flight. During the flight, a crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit due to a misunderstanding. The relief First Officer (FO) requested the Flight Attendant to inform the child to look out for a view of Greenland. The Flight Attendant misinterpreted this as an invitation for the child to enter the cockpit. Consequently, the child entered the cockpit, followed by the Flight Attendant. Upon realizing the oversight, the FO secured the cockpit and ensured the child and Flight Attendant were promptly escorted out. The situation was resolved without further complications.

Whatever training or emphasis Inflight puts on this training isn't working. More times than not the flight deck has to interject themselves into the process to make it work. On this flight three of the four Flight Attendants didn't think a call was necessary. The fourth F/A insisted. She ran the call. It was bad from the start. She didn't inform the A F/A that a medical call was being made. Didn't know where the jacks were; communications were atrocious. At one point when we finally were able to get her to understand she needed to talk to the Dr.; she keyed the MIC and talked for two minutes straight telling the story of the event. It only stopped when the flight deck keyed up the MIC and interrupted her and told her to stop talking. She seemed unable to grasp the difference from information the Dr. would need and completely irrelevant information. This was a non-emergency event by all accounts. The passenger was awake; alert; and said he felt fine after a juice and snack. If it had been critical this could have ended much differently. As it was; I instructed another F/A to take over towards the end. Anecdotally the F/As are not adequately trained to use the headset. They aren't adequately trained to understand the basics of radio communication. They don't talk loud enough. They don't understand the basic information the Dr. will want. They overstate the qualifications of Medical Personnel who are helping. In our case we had a ski resort medic. She repeatedly referred to him as 'Dr'. We are going to hurt someone. This was the worst medical call that I have ever witnessed. It was an embarrassment; and if it had been an actual crisis; a lot of time was wasted. We have to do better.,,,,B737-800 Captain reported the flight attendants did not seem to be adequately trained to properly utilize ground medical resources.,"The incident involved a flight attendant initiating a ground medical call that was poorly executed due to inadequate training. The attendant failed to communicate effectively, providing unnecessary details and incorrectly referring to a medical responder as a doctor. The situation was non-emergency, with the passenger recovering quickly, but highlighted significant training gaps. The result was a ineffective communication that wasted time and could have been critical in an emergency. The solution proposed is enhanced training for flight attendants in medical communication and procedures.",between attendant and other people

As I was contemplating asking if he needed to use his concentrator during all phases of the flight; I checked my manifest and noticed he wasn't even listed as having an O2 concentrator. As I was about to ask him a question or two; the passenger in 13B asked me if his (12B) O2 bottle ran out; would we have O2 bottles for him to use on board. I almost chuckled as I said 'he's not using O2 from a bottle; it's an O2 concentrator; but we have no info about it even being on board.' She replied that he indeed was using an O2 bottle as he has lung cancer and only 25% use of one of his lungs. I must have had a very odd look on my face as I said 'but he can't bring his own O2 bottle on board an aircraft; totally not allowed!' 'How did you get past the TSA?' She said they discovered the bottle; took it; checked it out; and returned it saying it was okay. My comment was 'they what?' 'So; no one else was informed that you had this and intended to use it on the plane? Turn it off please; now.' I went and retrieved one of our Portable Oxygen Bottles (POBs) and asked the D flight attendant to tell the A flight attendant to notify the flight deck. The passenger in 13B was the girlfriend of the passenger in 12B. She also told me he has used his own POB on many other flights before. She didn't say which airline.Being the C flight attendant; I'm not allowed to be forward of the exit rows for boarding; nor would I leave my cabin area of responsibility prior to takeoff. After takeoff; I'm setting up my cart as the B and D flight attendants are [completing other service duties]. So; not sure how I could have done anything different due to my position. Had I been working a position where I would have seen Mr. [12 B] on what I would have assumed was an O2 concentrator; I would have looked at my manifest to see if he was listed as using one. I would have then asked him if he needed to use it during all phases of flight including takeoff and landing; where I may have asked to move him to a window seat so as not to block/hamper other passengers egress to the main aisle in an emergency. That exchange most likely would have brought about a discovery of an O2 bottle and not a concentrator.I think lesson #1 is never assume a darn thing! Many passengers are not aware they need to disclose plans to use an O2 concentrator and I have watched them come onboard only to discover they aren't listed on my manifest. I then have time to contact an agent to see if they are aware of it and it just hasn't showed up on my manifest yet. I strongly suggest all flight attendants be very aware of passengers using O2 and watch for the device when passengers are boarding; then verify we all know about it. None of that would have mattered in this instance as his O2 bottle was concealed in a small black oblong bag. Boarding an aircraft is a crazy busy time for all concerned. All the more reason to be alert then; as well as any time after takeoff; to things like a passengers using (what should only be) an O2 concentrator and checking to make sure they are listed in our manifest or the proper tag has been placed on it by our agents.,,,,Flight Attendant reported discovering a lung cancer patient inhaling oxygen from a personal bottle not listed on the manifest. The bottle was turned off and replaced with an onboard bottle.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a passenger in seat 12B, diagnosed with lung cancer, used a personal oxygen bottle not listed on the manifest. The flight attendant, initially unaware, was informed by the passenger's girlfriend that TSA had permitted the bottle. Upon realizing the bottle's presence, the flight attendant retrieved an onboard portable oxygen bottle, instructed the passenger to turn off his personal device, and notified the cockpit. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of verifying oxygen device usage and being vigilant during boarding to prevent similar occurrences. The result was the passenger switching to the provided onboard bottle.",between attendant and other people

Upon check in; asked the Customer Service (CS) agent if there were any Specials (ie. FAMs; WCHRs; LEOs etc); he replied no. Boarding started with First Class; when a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) presented his paperwork to me in the First Class galley. Since the Pilots had not yet arrived; I got his info; advised him to take a seat and when the First Officers (FO) arrived I would advise. Soon after; one of the First Class passengers that had already boarded motioned me to the galley. Turns out he was a Federal Air Marshal (FAM); he presented and I verified credentials; and he was wanting to know where the LEO was seated. When the FOs boarded; they didn't know about the FAMs and LEO either. When the CS agent came down with the final paperwork; I asked him to the galley (out of passenger view) and told him that we as a crew need to know these in advance. This information was available when we checked in; so why wasn't it given to us then? His reply was; To tell us about these armed passengers would compromise security; and if I really need to know; it's all on the FINAL paperwork.,,,,A B737 Purser reported the gate agent refused to tell her where the Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) and Federal Air Marshal (FAM) were seated on their aircraft because to do so would be a security breach.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Purser) and ground personnel (Customer Service agent) regarding the disclosure of information about a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) and a Federal Air Marshal (FAM) on board a flight. The Purser, while boarding First Class passengers, encountered the LEO and later a FAM, both of whom required specific seating arrangements. The Purser sought to verify their credentials and seating locations but was informed by the Customer Service agent that such information could compromise security and was only available on the final paperwork. The Purser expressed frustration over the lack of advance communication, as this information is typically provided upon check-in. The Customer Service agent maintained that revealing the details would breach security protocols.

I did my PAX count and handed it to the pilots; just as I was about to head back to the rear of the plane the gate agent stopped me. He then handed me two; what looked like boarding passes and said that I needed to upgrade YYD to ZZD; as she was next on the upgrade list; and also pointed out that the other paper was an interrupted travel itinerary for PAX XXD. He then told me that the PAX in XXD may have had a bit too much to drink earlier so keep an eye on him. I asked the agent if he was going to be an issue and he said that he should be fine but wanted to give us a heads up just in case. I then upgraded the PAX in YYD to ZZD and checked on the PAX in XXD and he appeared to be fine. I had no issue with him and he did not cause a scene or anything else. I then went back the aft galley and called the FA-A and told them to make the CA aware of the situation of the PAX in XXD; but to also let him know that there were no problems and we felt fine taking him with us on the flight. The PAX slept for most of the flight and did not want any snack or beverage during flight. Once we landed the PAX in XXC told FA-A as he was deplaning that the PAX in XXD had urinated in the seat during landing and was wiping the seat down as he left. FA-A told the CA and the CA called for hazmat to come clean the seat. When cleaning/doing seatbelts both I and the other FA did not touch seats XXC/D and also warned the incoming crew.My main concern is not the possibly intoxicated PAX as he was fine there were no issues at all. I'm mainly concerned about how the gate agent handled this situation. He never made the crew or CA aware of this PAX until just before shutting the main cabin door. We as a crew never had a chance to discuss the situation until it was thrown at us right as the Main Cabin Door (MCD) was being closed. These type of situations should be brought to our attention as soon as possible. Again I want to say my main concern is with the gate agent not handling this situation properly.,,,,EMB175 Flight Attendant reported being informed by the Customer Service Representative as the main cabin door is closed; that a passenger they boarded is intoxicated but shouldn't pose a problem. He did not; but the passenger seated next to the possibly intoxicated passenger informed the Flight Attendant during deplaning that the possible intoxicated passenger urinated in his seat during landing.,"An incident occurred on an EMB175 flight involving a flight attendant and ground personnel. The flight attendant completed the passenger count and handed it to the pilots. A gate agent approached them with two boarding passes: one for an upgrade request (YYD) and another for a passenger (XXD) with an interrupted travel itinerary, noting that XXD might have been intoxicated. The flight attendant upgraded YYD and monitored XXD, who appeared fine during the flight. Upon landing, passenger XXC informed the flight attendant that XXD had urinated in the seat during landing. The captain was alerted, and hazmat was called to clean the area. The flight attendants avoided the affected seats and notified the incoming crew. The flight attendant expressed concern about the gate agent's handling of the situation, stating that the crew was only informed just before the cabin door closed, leaving them unprepared. The primary issue was the lack of timely communication from the ground staff. The flight attendant suggested that ground personnel should inform the crew about such situations as soon as possible to ensure preparedness.",between attendant and other people

I asked him to stow it. He became defensive and loudly said to me 'NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED ME TO DO THAT.' I asked again; and explained it was considered a carry on and therefore needed to go in the overhead; as he had no seat in front of him to stow it underneath. He again stated he had never been told to do that. He opened it and started to remove paperwork and personal items; and the passenger next to him asked me if that was ok. I said; yes he could secure those items in his hand; but not the backpack. I then placed the backpack in the overhead.As we were on the taxiway same passenger was on his phone. Passenger behind him looked at me to get my attention and pointed; at passenger and his phone and mouthed to me 'he is on the internet.' I tapped passenger on his shoe to get his attention and asked if he was in airplane mode. He replies; loudly; 'YES I AM AND WILL YOU STOP TOUCHING ME?' I answered; 'of course.' Passenger behind him; then taps him on the shoulder and says; 'I would appreciate it if you would do as you are asked; and get off your phone.' The father of the disruptive passenger turns around and states the son is using a certain app that isn't on the internet. The passenger who spoke up; looks at me and shakes his head. The disruptive passenger does not comply. When I hear the after takeoff chime; I go to the back galley and explain to [other Flight Attendant] what has been happening. We decide to switch and she will now [takes that part of the cabin]. This switch avoided further conflict between the disruptive passenger and myself. I don't believe I committed any errors. Passenger was not receptive to following directions; or to any verbal contact with me.,,,,A Flight Attendant reported that a passenger was not compliant in regard to stowing of baggage and electronic device usage.,"The incident began when a flight attendant (Party1) noticed a passenger (Party2) with a small backpack on his lap during the final cabin walk-through. The attendant asked the passenger to stow the backpack in the overhead bin, as it was considered carry-on luggage. The passenger became defensive, refusing to comply and stating that no one had ever asked him to do so. The situation escalated when the passenger opened the backpack and began removing items, despite the attendant's instructions to secure the items but not the backpack itself. The passenger continued to disregard the attendant's directives. Later, during taxiing, the passenger was observed using a phone, which drew the attention of another passenger who questioned whether it was permitted. The attendant tapped the passenger on the shoe to address the issue, asking if he was in airplane mode. The passenger loudly confirmed but became confrontational, telling the attendant to stop touching him. The passenger seated behind him then intervened, asking the disruptive passenger to follow instructions. The father of the disruptive passenger intervened, claiming the son was using an app that was not on the internet. The attendant decided to switch cabin sections to avoid further conflict, delegating the area to another flight attendant (Party1's colleague). This action aimed to de-escalate the situation and prevent further disruption. The flight attendant believed she handled the situation appropriately and did not feel she had made any errors. The disruptive passenger remained non-compliant and unresponsive to instructions. The incident was resolved without further escalation, as the attendant successfully transferred responsibility for the area to a colleague. The flight attendant's decision to switch cabin sections and transfer responsibility to another crew member was the proposed solution to avoid further conflict.",between attendant and other people

I was the A Flight Attendant (FA) so I made an all call to the crew to see if they smelled it also. All flight attendants smelled a strange odor. The front smelled like musty socks and the back smelled like parmesan cheese. I called the captain to tell him about the smell and he said they smelled it as well but they were climbing higher and thought it would dissipate. The D-E-H were all sitting in the forward galley with me. We all had headaches and distorted vision. Soon afterwards; I called the back galley to see if the odor dissipated; it didn't and was informed that our one pregnant (F) Flight attendant was being put on Oxygen. I called the captain to tell him that (F) was on oxygen and while I was on the phone I was informed B-C-F were all on Oxygen. I told the captain we didn't feel safe continuing. He said they were turning the plane around. I got up to go check on the FA's in the back and immediately felt light-headed and caught myself on the jumpseat. The E flight attendant told me to sit down and we got the oxygen bottles down and we were sharing the two bottles between the four of us. We were in the air for about 50 mins total. We landed at XA:14. Upon landing no one in inflight met our aircraft. The 'B' FA called crew service center and within 15 minutes inflight showed up to check on us. We told the inflight supervisors that we wanted to have blood tests run for Carbon Monoxide poisoning. They arranged for transportation to see a company doctor. We arrived there at XC:00. The company doctor said that he couldn't do the blood test. We were involved in many company calls through-out this ordeal and taxis were arranged for us to go to the hospital to get the blood test done. I was never seen by the company doctor since the taxis were on their way to take us to the Emergency Room (ER). A Manager showed up and about an hour later the taxis came. We arrived at the Hospital [5 hours after landing]. We saw the gate agent; who met our flight; in the ER waiting room; who didn't feel well; and we were informed also that three of our passengers needed treatment. The ER process was very fast and had blood drawn to check our CO levels. The doctor informed us that we should have been admitted soon after getting off the airplane. The test results will be forwarded to the company. According to Station Maintenance they washed the left engine the night before and were supposed to let it run for 10-20 minutes as procedure dictated; but the proper time wasn't allotted.I suggest during a fume incident that it should be company policy that you go straight to the ER for CO testing.I suggest that maintenance not take shortcuts when it comes to crew & passenger safety.,,We opened the auxiliary kit and put on masks. It was decided that the F needed to go on oxygen immediately as she is 5 months pregnant and we did not know what kind of fumes we were inhaling. Within 10 minutes from the beginning of the smell; we had 2 more bottles of oxygen between the other 3 of us in the back (B; C and G). The G decided not to use oxygen.Upon landing and deplaning we were not met by any manager; supervisor or paramedic. We had to call to ask someone to meet us. We were told by our pilots (who received information from the engineers); that the planes left engine had been cleaned the night before and 'may' not have had the engine run for 10-20 minutes to burn off chemicals; even though that is protocol after engines are cleaned.At this point; I was extremely disoriented; my eyes burned and I had a splitting headache. We all wanted to see a doctor and have our CO levels tested. Shayna began making calls and arranged for [medical] to pick us all up. It took over an hour between getting off the plane and being picked up to be checked out by the company doctor.We found out shortly after arriving at clinic that they would be unable to perform the blood test we needed done. At this point we were trying to get [ground] to take us someplace that could do the test. A Manager showed up and said taxis were on their way. It took about an hour and a half to be shuttled to the hospital.Once at the hospital; we were all admitted extremely quickly. Once I met with the doctor; my blood was drawn and tested for CO levels. The doctor told me it was most likely to come back with normal levels because of how long it had been since our exposure to the toxic fumes and that we should have been tested within a few hours. The test results will be forwarded to the company.There needs to be a very specific protocol for when there is a toxic fume event. We should NOT have been sent to [company medical provider]. They were extremely unprofessional and were unable to perform the test we needed done. Hours were lost spending time there and getting transportation to a location that was able to do the test.,,After takeoff; A330 flight attendants detected a strong chemical odor similar to 'spoiled eggs and vomit' which physiologically affected the crew and passengers. The flight returned to the departure airport. Post flight medical examinations revealed physiological symptoms; but blood tests samples were hours delayed and inconclusive.,"The incident involved a flight where a strong chemical odor, described as resembling spoiled eggs and vomit, was detected shortly after takeoff. This odor led to physiological symptoms such as headaches and vision issues among the flight attendants and passengers. The flight was subsequently turned around and returned to the departure airport. Upon landing, the crew experienced delays in receiving medical attention, as the initial medical provider was unable to conduct necessary blood tests promptly. The ground personnel indicated that the odor may have originated from the left engine, which had been cleaned the night before but not run long enough to eliminate fumes, as per protocol. The flight attendant suggested improved protocols for carbon monoxide testing and against maintenance shortcuts, while the ground personnel emphasized the need for specific procedures and criticized the delayed medical response. The medical tests conducted hours later were inconclusive due to the delay.",between attendant and other people

After running our checklist I emerged from the cockpit and heard a hissing sound that I recognized from our EVAC simulator; the sound of a slide deploying. I peered around the corner of my doorway and saw door 1R open; with the red tape still across the viewport and the slide pack flopped out onto the deck of a catering truck. The slide luckily had not inflated. I immediately told the caterer; who had stepped into the cabin over the slide into the galley and the flight attendants in the area; to get away from the area in case the slide was still able to inflate. On debriefing; it turned out the caterer had opened the door without getting the ok; with the red tape still across the viewport; indicating the door was still armed.When the mechanics arrived and secured the slide; we discussed how the door; when opened from outside; is supposed to disarm.

We stated that all passengers needed to deplane so we could do our emergency equipment checks; etc. The passengers deplaned aircraft and the Agent stated that a bag was still on board. We asked that the bag be removed by the Agent before we board ourselves. She needed to find the owner of the bag.

I went down the jetbridge to find out what was happening. I saw 10 people on the jetbridge with the Agent and I told her we would need time to check out equipement. When I got on the aircraft; there were 15 people on the aircraft with no personel on board. We told her everyone had to get off. When everyone deplaned; there was still a bag on board. We told her she had to take that too. Three agents boarded an airplane with no flight attendants on board. Then; she tried to close the door without talking to the flight attendants and pilots. He told her do not close the door; we had a mechanical [issue]. She apologized.,,Two flight attendants report how agents began to board passengers before the flight crew had arrived. They were surprised to discover that neither pilots or flight attendants were on board.,"The incident involved a conflict between ground personnel and flight attendants over boarding procedures at the gate. Ground personnel began boarding passengers before the flight crew arrived, which surprised the flight attendants and pilots. The flight attendants requested that all passengers deplane to perform emergency equipment checks, and after the passengers reboarded, the ground personnel attempted to close the aircraft door without consulting the flight crew. The flight attendants informed the ground personnel that maintenance personnel were still on board, preventing the door from being closed. The ground personnel ultimately apologized for the misunderstanding. No formal solution was proposed during the incident, but the issue was resolved through communication and clarification.",between attendant and other people

I explained to him that we do not open the doors from the inside but the caterer could open it from the outside. An Agent Supervisor (a woman in street clothes) came down and insisted that I open the door and I explained again that we do not open doors from the inside. She said that she was calling Inflight [Services].She called me out to the jetway phone and said that when it rang again it would be an Inflight Supervisor. When I answered the Supervisor never asked me what was going on or what the problem was; simply started quoting manual chapters to me. I told her that it is hammered into us all year that we do not open the doors from the inside. She said that I had to open the door. When I objected she said 'SWEETIE I am an Inflight Supervisor.' I then had another Flight Attendant confirm the door was disarmed and I opened it. I was forced to open a door with a large wheelchair sitting in front of the door and leaning out a four story open door with a straight drop to concrete. After I opened the door they discovered that the lift would not even come close to the door opening. Now I was forced to lean out the four story drop again to close the door that should never have been opened. So I had placed myself in danger for nothing.They then did what they should have done in the first place before causing a thirty minute delay and found a way to get it out via the jetway. Our Inflight Manual; section XXXXX says; 'flight attendants are NEVER to open an aircraft door from the inside...that; if there is a problem; they should contact an agent or Maintenance'. If the Inflight Supervisor had asked questions she would have [learned] how dangerous her demands were. If I had bumped the wheelchair in the opening and lost my balance or slipped while reaching outside the aircraft I would have dropped out of the four story opening onto the concrete below and there would have been a dead flight attendant on the tarmac.The Agent Supervisor would not listen to my safety concerns or to other options. The Inflight Supervisor was never interested in knowing what was going on from our safety perspective on the aircraft and never asked any questions about what was happening on the aircraft. They both forced us into putting our own safety in jeopardy for something that was never going to work in the first place. After the flight the woman that owned the chair came and talked to me. When I told her that the Ramp Agent told me that the battery was dead she said that if they had come and asked her she could have told them that [the battery cables] just come loose and she could have come and reconnected it. She was very upset about our treatment of her and her chair. All this happened because both supervisors were not interested in getting all the information before they made decisions and neither gave one moment's concern for the safety of the crew.,,,,An acrimonious exchange resulted when supervisors from passenger boarding and Inflight Service Departments demanded that a Flight Attendant (the reporter) open the A330's 2R cabin level passenger service door from inside the aircraft in direct violation of the company's Flight Attendant's Operations Manual forbidding doing so; the intended reason being to remove a passenger's electric wheel chair from the aircraft to a catering truck and thence to be boarded in cargo. After compelling the Attendant to do so they discovered the lift vehicle intended to remove the chair was unable to access the door opening.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and Ground Personnel over the improper handling of an electric wheelchair on an aircraft. The Ramp Agent requested the Flight Attendant to open the 2R door from the inside to load the wheelchair onto a catering truck, despite company policy prohibiting such actions. The Agent Supervisor and Inflight Supervisor insisted on the door being opened, ignoring the Flight Attendant's safety concerns and explanations that doors should only be opened from the outside. After the door was opened, it was discovered that the lift vehicle intended to remove the wheelchair could not access the door opening, resulting in a thirty-minute delay. The wheelchair owner later expressed frustration, stating that if consulted, she could have resolved the issue without opening the door. The supervisors failed to consider alternative solutions or safety protocols, unnecessarily putting the Flight Attendant at risk. The incident highlights the importance of adhering to safety procedures and consulting all parties before making decisions that compromise safety.",between attendant and other people

The flight attendant encountered the odor during preflight and when emptying trash, leading to dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, dry heaves, and vomiting. Despite measures like drinking water and resting, symptoms persisted, prompting notifications to the domicile, supervisor, and union. The union noted previous attempts to halt the practice, and the flight attendant remained off work two weeks later.

The clearance consisted of 'Taxi to Runway 4R' via Bravo and Juliette. After receiving the clearance; and prior to taxi; I confirmed with the First Officer and verified the taxi clearance with the airport diagram. We started moving straight ahead via Bravo and momentarily stopped on 4L to do our normal safety visual clearance (Left and Right) and then; continued taxi toward Juliette. After reaching Juliette; and turning right; we stopped before crossing Runway 11. When we stopped; we received a call from Ground Control with a possible Pilot deviation; and they also gave us a phone number to contact them. After the call; we received clearance to cross Runway 11 and continue Taxi to 4R. At the end of the runway; on the holding short area; I called the Tower. They informed me that we crossed 4L without clearance.We never had the intention to cross any active runway. However; with the clearance that we received (and verified with the airport diagram); we understood that we were clear to taxi all the way to 4R; including crossing the Runways (4L and 11). Apparently; my First Officer misunderstood the taxi clearance because; usually the normal taxi clearance instructions are 'Taxi Runway 4R via Bravo and hold short Runway 4L.' After that; we usually receive further clearance.  In my opinion; since Juliette Taxiway is at the end of Bravo; and prior to Juliette is Runway 4L; when we received the clearance instructions the way we got them; it became confusing and created an involuntary error. Again; we understood; we were cleared to taxi to Runway 4R; via Bravo and Juliette.,,,,An air carrier crew cleared to LFT Runway 4R taxied all the way to the Runway crossing Runway 4L but stopping prior to Runway 11 because they thought the taxi clearance included crossing intervening runways.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) at Lafayette Airport. The flight attendant reported receiving taxi clearance to Runway 4R via Bravo and Juliette. After confirming the clearance with the first officer and referencing the airport diagram, the crew began taxiing. They momentarily stopped on Runway 4L for safety checks and continued toward Juliette. Upon reaching Juliette and turning right, they stopped before crossing Runway 11 and received a call from Ground Control regarding a possible deviation. Ground Control provided a phone number and later cleared the crew to cross Runway 11 and proceed to Runway 4R. Upon reaching the holding short area, the Tower informed the crew that they had crossed Runway 4L without clearance. The flight attendant stated that the crew had intended to follow the taxi clearance as understood, which they believed included crossing intervening runways. The flight attendant attributed the misunderstanding to the taxi clearance instructions, which they claimed were ambiguous and different from the usual format (""Taxi Runway 4R via Bravo and hold short Runway 4L""). The first officer reportedly misapplied the instructions, leading to the unintended crossing of Runway 4L. The crew ultimately followed the corrected instructions and resolved the situation without further incident.",between attendant and other people

Nothing was ever said to me about Air Marshals on the flight. This flight had FAA Inspector on board; who works in the Certificate Management Office. The problem began when the agent started the boarding process without consulting with the flight attendants. Passengers arrived at the airplane; catching the flight attendants off guard. The FAA Inspector actually held the passengers on the jet bridge while the flight attendants scrambled to prepare the airplane. FAA Inspector apparently confronted the ticket agent and; according to the Inspector; the ticket agent copped an attitude. A few minutes later an armed FBI agent appeared at the cockpit door to show me his ID. I had no paper work on the individual and he said the ticket agent had my copy of the paper work. A few minutes later a DEA agent arrived at the airplane; and this time the ticket agent had sent my paper work with the DEA agent. I asked the DEA agent if he was aware of the Air Marshals and the FBI agent that were also on the flight; and he said he knew about the FBI agent; but not the Air Marshals. I immediately called for a supervisor to come to the plane. I explained the situation to the supervisor and he apologized for the mix up and said he would take care of the issue. A few minutes later another ticket agent came into the cockpit and I asked if the LEOs had met the Air Marshals. He said there were no Air Marshals on board. Then the original ticket agent came to the cockpit and I asked him if there were any Air Marshals on board. He said 'no'. One of the ticket agents went back to the gate counter and returned to the airplane a few minutes later and told me there were indeed two Air Marshals on board. Knowing that the two LEO's did not know of the Air Marshals; I instructed the ticket agent to inform all four armed individuals of each other. (Which he did). The flight departed 13 minutes late with no further issues. FAA Inspector said he would be investigating the events on this flight which has prompted me to submit this report.,,,,Armed Federal Agents and Law Enforcement Officers boarded aircraft without proper notification to the crew and or knowledge of each others presence.,"An incident occurred when multiple armed federal agents boarded a flight without prior notification to the crew, resulting in confusion and a delayed departure. The agents included an FAA Inspector, FBI agent, DEA agent, and two Air Marshals. The boarding process began without consulting the flight attendants, who were unprepared, causing a delay as passengers were held on the jet bridge. Communication issues led to the flight attendant being unaware of all law enforcement personnel initially. After an FBI agent and DEA agent arrived, the flight attendant sought a supervisor, who apologized and resolved the confusion by informing all agents of each other's presence. The flight departed 13 minutes late, with the FAA Inspector initiating an investigation.",between attendant and other people

After the Lead Flight Attendant made his announcements; I thought I heard him say 'prepare doors.' I did so and began walking up the aisle checking on passengers. At this time; I realized that the front entry door and cockpit doors remained open. I proceeded to walk forward to inquire. When I arrived to the forward galley; a caterer came from the rear of the aircraft and informed us that he had popped the slide. We inquired if he was injured; and he said no. I followed him to the aft galley as he told me that he had seen the orange strap; but that his sunglasses had been giving off a glare and he had opened the door anyway. The slide had been fully deployed and was facing upward at an angle as the door was only partially opened. The gate agent; the caterer; and I placed the slide inside the aft galley so the plane could be taken to another gate and a new plane brought to our current gate. We immediately contacted the Captain and began to secure another aircraft; deplane passengers; and continue our flight. The entire procedure was done effectively and efficiently and we departed less than 50 minutes late and all connections were good.I am eternally thankful that no one was injured due to my misunderstanding and know in the future I will be on high alert and double check myself. In this job; there are so many things going on at once in an attempt to board passengers; stow their bags; do our duties and depart on time. Sometimes; I get caught up in repetitive routines like simply shutting the doors and preparing for the demo that I have neglected a very important aspect. I should have immediately returned to the aft galley and 'unprepared' my doors as soon as I saw the forward entry door was open. As for the caterer; thankfully he was not injured; however; I would hope in the future he will never attempt to open a door with the strap across the window.,,,,An emergency exit slide was deployed at the gate by a caterer when a Flight Attendant incorrectly understood the order to arm the doors had been given.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant misunderstood an order to arm the doors, leading to an emergency exit slide being deployed at the gate by a caterer. The Flight Attendant believed they had heard the Lead Flight Attendant instruct to ""prepare doors"" and proceeded to check the cabin. Upon reaching the forward galley, they discovered the front entry door and cockpit doors were open. A caterer approached and explained that they had intentionally opened the forward entry door, mistaking the orange safety strap for a signal to deploy the slide due to sunglass glare. The slide was fully deployed and facing upward, creating an obstruction. The Flight Attendant, along with the caterer and gate agent, secured the slide, moved the aircraft to another gate, and coordinated with ground staff to bring a replacement aircraft. Passengers were deplaned, and the flight resumed less than 50 minutes after the initial delay. No injuries were reported, and the situation was handled efficiently. The Flight Attendant acknowledged the importance of double-checking procedures and expressed gratitude for the positive outcome. The caterer was unharmed but was advised against such actions in the future.",between attendant and other people

Normal departure out of TEB [and] at 1;000 FT AGL engaged the autopilot. Autopilot flew the SID properly [and] leveled off 1;500 FT on a 240 degree heading. Autopilot turned aircraft towards 280 degree heading; but failed to stop and continued another 20-30 degrees. I disconnected autopilot immediately to turn back to 280 degree heading. At the same time ATC instructed us to expedite climb to 6;000 FT. My First Officer answered the call and I began to climb. In the same transmission ATC also instructed us to turn right direct to BREZY. My First Officer responded to that and directed the FMS to take us to BREZY. As we made the turn and climb; ATC questioned us as to where we were going and [told us] that we should be on a 280 degree heading. I immediately turned back to 280 degrees. My First Officer responded; 'You gave us direct to BREZY.' ATC responded that he was sorry he missed the incorrect read back and not to worry; it was his mistake. He said he had asked us to expedite the climb and to 'expect a right turn direct BREZY.' A contributing factor to the miscommunication was the busyness of the frequency workload on the Controller; the aural warning of the autopilot disconnect causing additional noise in the headset for my First Officer; as well as the FMS and autopilot incorrectly flying the SID. A corrective action would be for ATC not to accept an incorrect read back in such a crucial phase of flight. I will [also] hand fly the SID form now on. Discouraging as it is; I will not trust the approved FMS and autopilot to actually fly the SID. Had this situation not occurred at this inopportune time; both my First Officer and I would have taken a moment to question the instructions given.,,,,PC12 Captain experiences an autopilot malfunction during the TEB 6 departure; resulting in a track deviation.

The autopilot failed to stop at the correct heading, prompting the captain to disconnect it. Subsequently, the crew received ATC instructions to expedite climb and turn right direct to BREZY. However, the crew incorrectly read back the instructions as ""cleared direct to BREZY,"" which ATC later acknowledged was their mistake due to workload and miscommunication. Contributing factors included the controller's busy frequency, the autopilot's aural warning causing headset noise, and the FMS and autopilot's incorrect handling of the SID. As a result, the captain decided to hand-fly the SID in the future, distrusting the FMS and autopilot. ATC was advised to avoid accepting incorrect readbacks during critical phases of flight.",between attendant and other people

She said a passenger found it in the seatback pocket. I had a napkin; held out my hand; turned to the cockpit door which was still open; and told the Captain. It was his decision to reopen the door and hand it off to security. Flight Attendant #3 and I both went to her door to disarm and wait for agents. When the door opened; I stepped to the threshold and handed the item to the security agent and explained the situation. (I was unable to step off the aircraft because of minimum crew issues). He immediately started turning the item over and opening it up. Both of us flight attendants were astonished at this and said as much. A gate agent didn't seem the least bit concerned so I said; I don't believe a proper security check was done on the aircraft for one; and secondly it is not procedure to open/handle any items found on the aircraft that they are to be treated as a potential (non secure) item. The gate agent said that he didn't see what the problem was; it was a Palm Pilot and he made a 'risk assessment' of the item and 'it doesn't look like a bomb'! Again; the #3 and I were horrified that he would even say something to that nature; especially since the passengers seated in rows 9 and 10 were in clear earshot of his comment. The #3 and I both told him to keep it down and what was he thinking saying something like that? I turned and went to the cockpit to relay the information the Captain. Shortly thereafter; the gate agent came into the cockpit with the item; at which time I left. The Captain had a discussion with him; during which time the #3 had been in verbal contact with one of our FAMs seated in row 4 to let them know what was going on. Later on in flight we had a chance to discuss the situation with the team leader of the FAMs that evening. We expressed our concern to both the Captain and the FAM leader about the lack of concern shown and how we felt the situation was handled in a complete opposite way that we as flight attendants have always been trained. The gate agent showed no concern toward the situation and treated #3 and I as if we were complete idiots and overreacting to something that was in his opinion just a Palm Pilot that was clearly left on board by a passenger.,,,,A B757 Flight Attendant was given a Palm Pilot type device which a passenger found in a seatback before departure.

It was handed to another attendant, who proceeded to the cockpit. The captain decided to reopen the door to transfer the item to security. Upon opening the door, the flight attendant handed the item to the security agent, who immediately examined and opened it, surprising the attendants. A gate agent, unimpressed, dismissed the item as a simple Palm Pilot and made a risk assessment, claiming it didn't look like a bomb. This comment distressed the attendants, as nearby passengers could hear the exchange. They expressed their concerns to the gate agent, urging caution and adherence to security protocols. The attendant informed the captain, who spoke with the gate agent. Meanwhile, another attendant kept the FAMs informed. Later, the flight attendants discussed their concerns with the FAM team leader, highlighting the gate agent's lack of concern and the mishandling of the situation, which conflicted with their training.

As I was talking the Flight Attendant paused her conversation to ask me if it was OK to board the aircraft. I replied; 'No; it is not OK to board; please hold boarding'. She then advised the gate agent 'the mechanic said no; it is not OK to board'.After I finished my conversation with Maintenance Control; I went back to the cockpit to inform the Captain. I also informed the flight crew and the flight attendants that I had to go down in the E&E compartment to do a 'BITE' test on the IRU; and for them to not let any one near this area. At that point I proceed to go to the E&E compartment through the floor entrance.Shortly after I entered the E&E compartment I heard a noise. I looked to my right and discovered that someone had fallen into the E&E compartment. I asked the passenger if he was OK and he confirmed that he was. At that point I called out for help.

Although the door chime had not been given; the Ramp Agent opened the aft door and gave me a thumbs up to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots never told us to hold passengers and I could see that the 'A' Flight Attendant had opened the main cabin door; so I let passengers start to deplane. I did not realize an engine was still running due to problems with the APU. I was having trouble getting my ears to pop and could not hear very well. The ramp agents never told me to keep passengers on board. Even after the passengers started getting off; the ramp agents continued to unload bags. I didn't fully realize what had happened until we were in the taxi on our way to the hotel and Flight Attendant 'A' brought it up. We all should have communicated better and the aft door should not have been opened by the ramp until the engines were shut down and it was safe for passengers to deplane.We need to stress the importance of the ramp [personnel] being aware of what is going on around them.

Upon arrival, the seatbelt signs were off, but the door chime was not received. The Ramp Agent opened the aft door, prompting the Flight Attendant to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots had shut down engine #1 but left engine #2 running, awaiting ground power unit connection. The flight attendant, unaware of the running engine, permitted deplaning. Another flight attendant noticed the engine still running and shut it down after passengers had started leaving. Passengers deplaned while engine #2 was running, posing a safety risk. Post-incident, all parties agreed on the need for enhanced communication and awareness. Improve communication and coordination among flight, ground, and cabin crew. Ground personnel should act as the eyes and ears for the flight crew. Cabin crew should enhance their observational skills and not solely rely on ground crew information.

I threw the sweater to him and then closed the door.At the time we began our pushback from the gate I had NOT given the Captain our passenger count; learned he had 2 observers in the cockpit and the cockpit door was still open. I had not yet initiated the 'Secure doors for pushback' announcement at the point the aircraft was moving on the ground. I quickly made the PA; waited for appropriate response; provided the count and then closed the door. We quickly attended to our duties including the safety demo only to get interrupted during the middle of it by a cleared for departure announcement from the cockpit. We quickly finished the O2 portion before we took off. The flight proceeded as planned but upon arrival; after observers had left the cockpit; I commented to the Captain that the doors had not been armed when we began pushback. He shared he had told the agent to shut the door. The First Officer later shared with me he had suggested a later wheels up time; but the Captain had said no; to stay with one we had been given. We also had a new hire Flight Attendant on board and I had to explain to her all the things that went WRONG with this experience. Agents should NOT close the door prior to Flight Attendant okay. This situation would not have occurred had the door remained open and the other timing/safety/FAR violations wouldn't have been an issue. In addition; the aircraft should NEVER move on the ground before the cockpit door is shut. The entry door shouldn't be shut before the doors are armed! Captain shouldn't have initiated the closure of the front door; unless he had verified with the lead Flight Attendant.,,,,A lead Flight Attendant detailed numerous failures by cockpit and ground crews to comply with FARs and company SOP during pushback and taxi.,"The incident was triggered by the ground personnel closing the aircraft door prematurely, without the flight attendant's authorization. This occurred while passengers were still boarding and overhead bins were open, leading to subsequent safety protocol violations. The flight attendant attempted to address the situation but faced further issues during pushback. The cockpit door remained open, and the captain had two observers on board without informing the flight crew. The attendant had to make an urgent announcement but did not receive a proper response, affecting the safety briefing and takeoff preparations. Upon arrival, it was discovered that the cockpit doors were not armed during pushback, indicating a clear safety hazard. The incident highlighted multiple failures in adhering to Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) and company Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The flight attendant had to debrief a new hire about the mishandled procedures, emphasizing the importance of compliance with safety protocols. To prevent recurrence, it was suggested that ground personnel should not close the door without explicit approval from the flight attendant. Additionally, the aircraft should not move on the ground until the cockpit door is securely closed and the entry door is properly armed. The captain should verify with the lead flight attendant before initiating any door closures, ensuring all safety measures are in place.",between attendant and other people

The biohazard guys came on and found that a young boy had a temperature of 38.7; 38 being normal. They decided to quarantine him; his row; the rows in front and back of him; and something like 6 flight attendants; who had served him. One of them told a language speaker that a doctor was coming and would check him on board.  After about 20 minutes; the station manager finally showed up and said that to protect their departure on the 13th; the Chinese authorities would accept just one Flight Attendant. She didn't want to speak to me; and tried to ignore me; but I got involved in the conversation and asked where the doctor was; since this boy was only a fraction of a degree above normal; which may be normal for him. She didn't have a clue; and suddenly didn't seem to understand English anymore.  The purser and I asked her how they were going to determine which Flight Attendant would be quarantined. She said we should choose. We both said we would not do that; that we had no right to order someone to go into quarantine. She said then she would choose. When I asked her what she would do when that person refused; she again didn't understand English. I guess she's not used to people not obeying her.  Finally; the Purser said he would stay. I applaud him for doing that; but what makes this even more bizarre is that he never came into contact with the boy. I asked that station manager why not just send a customer service agent to go with the quarantined people; since they are local and speak the language. She didn't seem to understand my question...again.  Now here's the safety issue:  One of our crew members; who was completely healthy; was forced to go to a non-western hotel; where sick people were being held in quarantine; and given no bottled water (only purification tablets to use with tap water). What if he now gets sick?,,,,An air carrier Captain reported a verbal clash between bio-hazard personnel in ZSPD and flight attendants who had been exposed to a young man who was being quarantined due to the possibility he may have an infectious disease.,"The incident occurred at ZSPD when a young boy with a temperature of 38.7°C was quarantined, along with his row and six flight attendants who had served him. Biohazard personnel, led by a station manager, enforced these measures. The manager initially stated that only one flight attendant could depart, causing a conflict with the flight crew. The crew refused to select someone for quarantine, leading the manager to decide. The purser volunteered to stay, despite not being in contact with the boy. The Captain questioned why a customer service agent couldn't accompany the quarantined individuals, but the manager didn't respond. A safety concern arose as a healthy crew member was sent to a hotel with sick individuals, provided only with purification tablets and tap water. The purser's decision to stay and the Captain's suggestion for customer service involvement highlighted the need for improved quarantine protocols.",between attendant and other people

They were looking at seat ABX and asked if the armrest came up.  I informed them that it did not; but that the one on ABY did.  They were happy because they were able to switch seats making me realize that they were ticketed for seats ABXY and the man was unable to get into the seat without the armrest coming up.  I located the button and lifted the armrest.  Afterwards I immediately called another attendant to inform her that we very likely had a passenger that qualified under the company's new rule about passengers of size.  She was the attendant greeting passengers and she would be the first one to have contact with a customer service agent to inform them of the problem. The flight was booked oversold by 12.  Therefore we pretty much knew the flight would be full when addressing the passenger of size issue.  The customer service agents came down to the plane later in the boarding process to check carry-on bags.  As soon as I could get through the aisle I spoke to one of them about the passenger of size.  Instead of taking care of the problem themselves they immediately called for a supervisor to handle it.  During this time there were two customer service agents at the plane but none of them would approach the passenger until a supervisor finally showed up. One of the agents did eventually go speak to the passenger about having to take a later flight.  She returned to the boarding door to tell us that the passenger did not want to take a later flight.  They were then going to remove two non-revenue space available passengers who were sitting together towards the front of the plane.  They were going to move the passenger of size to the two seats. Again the agent went back to tell the passenger and again she returned this time saying that the passenger did not want to switch seats.  She then added that if he did not want to change seats we could not force him to do so.  This directly contradicts the company's passenger of size policy. The purser made me feel guilty when they tried to remove the non-revenue space available passengers from the flight.  I also felt guilty since my intention was not to have anyone unrelated to the situation removed from the flight.  However this was both a policy and safety issue.  Multiple people (employees) asked if any of the passengers near the passenger of size had complained which they had not.  The response that I got was that I was creating the problem and that if no one complained it was not even an issue. Again this is contradictory to the passenger of size policy.  The criteria are not based on whether anyone complains.  It is based on safety issues.  The customer service agents did not seem to want to do anything about it and I was being made to feel that I was creating a problem and why was I doing that?  I finally gave in and dropped the issue.  They shut the door and all of the passengers remained in their original seats. As a result of this passenger's size and the seat that he was in (that he refused to move from) the aisle armrest was up for the entire flight including for taxi; take-off and landing.  This was very frustrating.  The company has a policy in place to prevent this.  Instead of following it I was made to feel as if I had created a problem by almost everyone involved from the customer service agents to the customer service supervisor and even by one of my flying partners. Also as part of the policy both the customer service agents and flight attendants are supposed to be proactive.  In this case it was an oversold flight.  It is almost impossible that the customer service agents did not notice his size during boarding.  It makes me wonder why they did not look into the issue at that point.  During the flight half of the passenger's body was out in the aisle.  I tripped over him (he was genuinely apologetic). At another point during the flight there was a traffic jam of passengers in the aisle because they could not get by this passenger.  The thought that came to mind was that if there was a medical emergency I was not sure if we would be able to quickly get down the aisle because half of this person's body was in the aisle. If policy was followed this situation never would have occurred.  Instead I was made to feel guilty and treated as if I was creating a problem because I wanted to follow safety and policy.,,,,Flight Attendant reports she received no support when she attempted to invoke the airline's policy regarding passengers of size.,"The incident occurred on an oversold flight where a passenger of size caused seating issues. The flight attendant attempted to address the problem by switching seats and informing customer service agents, but they did not proactively resolve the situation, leading to the armrest remaining up throughout the flight. This resulted in safety concerns and a congested aisle. The attendant felt unsupported and guilted by the customer service team, despite the company's policy to prevent such situations.",between attendant and other people
850257,Aircraft X,General Seating Area,Air Carrier,Flight Attendant (On Duty),,,,Communication Breakdown; Confusion; Time Pressure,Party1 Flight Attendant; Party2 Ground Personnel; Party2 Other,850257,,,,,,,,,,,,Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Illness / Injury,,Y,Person Flight Attendant; Person Gate Agent / CSR,Aircraft In Service At Gate,,Company Policy; Procedure; Human Factors,Human Factors,I was aft Purser for this overseas flight and when boarding the aircraft I saw 2 oxygen tanks in the overhead and 2 more tanks on the opposite side. Spoke to the Purser about this because there had been no information for passenger on oxygen on our briefing sheet. Later a passenger service representative boarded; letting us know that; indeed; we would have a passenger on oxygen. Fortunately; the agent had seen the passenger in the boarding area and saw that the passenger would not be using a nasal cannula but a trachea cannula instead. Everything on the aircraft had been incorrectly set up for a nasal cannula.  The agent redid the hoses and explained how to change the tanks.  The passenger was with his family and a paramedic in the boarding area but the paramedic was not allowed to board per a TSA officer even though the Captain had allowed it.  So; five minutes before departure the passenger is hastily boarded; along with his wife and 2 daughters who are traveling with him. I am given no additional/further medical information and am trying to communicate with people who speak limited English. One of the daughters questions me if the flight goes all the way to Vietnam. I tell her the flight number does but that everyone needs to deplane in VHHH. She becomes worried and says her father needs to stay on the oxygen and that they had been told that they wouldn't have to deplane. She makes a quick phone call and I speak to the Doctor. She is concerned about the VHHH stop because they had NOT been told about this. I assured them that they would have oxygen in VHHH and that everything was already taken care of because the computer booking would have alerted someone that this wasn't a nonstop flight. The doors were already closed at this time so I told the daughter that we would follow through and confirm with VHHH later on during the flight. I spoke with the Purser about this and we both felt it was important to follow up with VHHH because everything else related to our passenger had been very unorganized and mismanaged. Luckily; we had a Flight Attendant that spoke Vietnamese.  I asked her to speak to the family after takeoff and reassure them that the oxygen would have already been prearranged in VHHH.  Later; when the Vietnamese literate Flight Attendant was on her break; our passenger needed to use the bathroom.  I tried to communicate with the family to see how long he could be without oxygen and I couldn't really get a straight answer because of the language barrier. I erred on the side of caution and we strapped a portable oxygen bottle around the daughter who was assisting her father to the bathroom. The Purser had communicated to the cockpit the need for verification that we would have oxygen for the passenger in VHHH. Eventually; the cockpit received a message that the passenger had been advised in their PNR that there would be no oxygen in VHHH!!!!! And if they need it; it would be $250 USD. The Vietnamese speaker spoke to the family and they became a bit upset because here we are getting close to landing and we are making last minute arrangements for oxygen. Upon landing someone comes down the aisle with an aisle wheel chair and no oxygen. I had to forcefully let them know our passenger could not be moved without oxygen. The Purser; myself and a few of the economy flight attendants stayed on board for 40 minutes with the passenger and his family while company customer service representatives explained to the family that the price of the oxygen would be around $500 USD!!!!! This was due to the cost of a Doctor or Nurse needing to be there and there was a minimum charge for a set number of hours. The family became very distressed. The father was on his deathbed and this was his last flight so he could die in Vietnam and they had been given wrong information. It was devastating for us to see how poorly this family had been treated by our Company. More importantly; it was dangerous that someone didn't follow throughproperly. This family was basically shoved on the airplane without proper medical information ever being gathered and placed in his computer record and communicated to the crew.  Subsequently; the paramedic should have been allowed to board.  By to let the paramedic board; important medical information was not able to be conveyed to the crew due to the language barrier.,,,,A Purser relates her concerns about the services provided a passenger traveling with special medical needs.,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",between attendant and other people
