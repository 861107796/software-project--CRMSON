Crew voiced concerns about the finding and I held conversation with Captain about crew concerns. Captain initiated a conversation with operations; and I went to the rear of the plane to investigate the situation further. The biohazard bag had not been closed so I put on gloves and carefully looked  inside. The contents were soiled; linens; wipes; and the dustpan from the large bag. After discussion with the crew; we agreed that we were happy to put the bag into a sealed container as we knew what the contents were. I returned to door; and reported my findings to the Captain and also of the conversation amongst the crew.

At no time was the entertainment system switched off prior to; during or following the demonstration. Once the demonstration was complete I went to the aft galley; where only 3 FAs (Flight Attendants) sit; and offered to be a 4th FA and sit at jump seat  and assume FA #8. I was in uniform and willing to assist. A short while later the Purser came to the back galley and informed me that she only wanted working"" FAs to be involved and asked that I return to my seat in the cabin. As the aircraft approached the runway there was no command from the Flight Deck to assume the demonstrated brace positions which made something of a mockery of performing an evacuation demonstration. After landing and deplaning the DHD (Deadhead) FAs were then converted to work the sector departing some 5 hours later at XA50 landing in ZZZZ airport at XK33; meaning extreme fatigue ensued due to being awake for approx. 27 hours prior to landing. The operating Pilots and FAs were released from duty following the incident yet the DHD crew onboard were not afforded the same courtesy even though they had less hours available to them and had experienced the same situation.""",,,,An off-duty Flight Attendant reported while dead heading the aircraft had an issue with the landing gear and offered to assist with safety procedures but was denied.,"The incident involved an off-duty Flight Attendant (Party1) who attempted to assist during a safety procedure on a flight. The aircraft experienced an issue with the landing gear, prompting the captain to conduct a preparation for land evacuation demonstration. During this time, Party1, who was in uniform and seated in the cabin, volunteered to assist by taking on the role of FA #8 at the jump seat in the aft galley. However, the Purser (Party2) denied this offer, instructing Party1 to return to their seat in the cabin, stating that only working Flight Attendants should be involved in the safety procedure. After landing, the off-duty Flight Attendants (deadhead crew) were reassigned to work the next departing flight, which caused significant fatigue due to being awake for approximately 27 hours. This decision was particularly challenging because the deadhead crew had less time available compared to the on-duty crew, who were subsequently released from their duties. The inconsistency in treatment and the denial of assistance led to frustration among the deadhead crew, who felt their efforts and well-being were overlooked despite being part of the same incident. A proposed solution is to ensure fair treatment and consideration for all crew members, including those deadheading, in such situations.",crew-related issues

Ultimately; I failed to notify either Operations in ZZZ or the Captain. Upon reflection during the flight and; as not to create an 'issue;' I realized that I had failed to handle the situation correctly. In an effort to not continue the risk; upon arrival in ZZZ1; I spoke with the Operations Agent and explained the situation and asked if it could be corrected.

After arriving; the reporter notified an Operations Agent to deal with the bag's contents.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who was informed by a passenger that their checked luggage contained an electric razor and a camera, potentially housing lithium batteries. The attendant initially failed to notify Operations or the Captain, possibly due to uncertainty about the items. Upon realizing the oversight, the attendant informed an Operations Agent upon arrival, leading to the passenger's bags being pulled before their connecting flight.

She approached me in the back and insisted there was space for her bag and that she wanted to bring it on board. I suggested she speak to the speak to the A-FA in the front and see if it was possible. Once she went back to the front and saw the ramp agent threw her bag down; she approached me again and began yelling at me demanding an explanation for the other flight attendants refusal. I explained that it's protocol for any tagged bag to be sent to cargo. She returned to her seat after our discussion. It wasn't until we were inflight and I was doing beverage service that I noticed she was filling out a complaint form to company. I saw her writing but I continued with my duties and asked if she wanted anything to drink or a snack. She looked at me; noted my name and requested water. After I finished service; I started to reorganize my galley for the next flight. However; I heard several overhead bins opening simultaneously which concerned me. I discovered that the passenger had opened them and was taking photos of all the empty bins. I needed to prioritize securing my galley so I focused on the safety in the back. Once I finished; I checked to see if the passenger was still standing in the aisle but she had returned to her seat. I called the A-FA to inform her about the passengers actions and we both agreed to notify the Captain.

The Captain was notified of both issues with no additional information provided.,"The incident occurred on a flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1, involving a passenger (Party2) and a flight attendant (Party1). The cause was the passenger's refusal to check her bag for an international trip, leading to a confrontation. The process began with the passenger insisting her bag fit in the overhead compartment, which the flight attendant redirected to the front attendant. When the passenger was denied, she became upset, yelled at the flight attendant, and filled out a complaint form during the flight. The result was the passenger opening multiple overhead bins and taking photos, prompting the flight attendant to secure the galley and notify the captain. The captain was informed about both this misconduct and a separate issue involving a passenger's bag with lithium batteries.

Between ZZZ1 and ZZZZZ Captain did a normal system monitor check. Upon looking at the COND page; he noticed the AFT Cargo Temp at 180 degrees (Steady Green); asked me if I had seen a temp that high; I replied No! We kept an eye on it; over the next 10 minutes; noticed it rising to 188 degrees; then 194 degrees (still Steady Green) where it stayed for the duration of the flight. This made us uncomfortable for normal Cargo Bay temperatures in my 3;000+ hours flying this aircraft at 2 different airlines have never exceeded cabin temperatures during cruise. We simultaneously started looking into what could be a catastrophic problem. I got into the QRH AOM/FOM/and other manuals to look for temperature limitations and fixes. I found none; anywhere. During the same time; Captain got on the Phone with Operations and phone patched to Maintenance Control; where they attempted multiple resets to no success. When Captain got off the phone with Maintenance; he said; 'Well nothing fixed It; and they (Maintenance) said we are on our own.'At that point; we agreed as a crew that we didn't know what was going on down there. We were both not comfortable taking an aircraft with this indication over water; with limited divert options to an international location; and with no company or Contract Maintenance at the destination not knowing what was going on down there. The indication was steady at this point; not rising higher [than] 194 degrees; nor giving any other indications to the back when we notified the Flight Attendants and told them what was going on. At this point; we felt we were not in a land as soon as possible scenario; but in a land as soon as practical scenario but keeping land as soon as possible options available and we decided to divert to ZZZ2. We gave ATC a PAN PAN call since we were going to a divert airport that wasn't our alternate but that we were not at the time an emergency aircraft; we just wanted to have all our bases covered. We notified Dispatch both via phone patch and ACARS. During descent we were cleared the ZZZZZ Arrival to ZZZ2.We were still grossly overweight with a lot of gas; so we referenced the overweight Checklist. With that; we decided that with the condition still not worsening from what had been continuously indicated with no secondary indications or issues coming from the cabin; Captain and I both agreed that in an effort not to compound the problem we should hold to burn down gas; but having immediate [landing] options nearby; so we held at ZZZZZ1 at 16;000 ft. for 30-40 min and got to a calculated weight that would put us on deck in ZZZ2 right at Max landing weight. We continued to ZZZ2 via the arrival; for an uneventful Runway XX landing. On a side note; the XX transition from the ZZZZZ Arrival is a bit of a slam dunk. We asked for a bit longer final to get down; stabilized; and situated; and ATC approach gave us a few last second altitude; headings; and speed amendments through final which started to task saturate us as we prepared for landing. For example: open descent from 6;000-3;000; we were told to amend altitude and maintain 4;000 ft. while passing 4;200 feet; thrust idle; and speed brakes out. We blew through the altitude and had to climb back up Auto Pilot off; ALT horn blaring; and engines spooling up to 80+%; and getting speed brakes back in. We were also given several headings through final; and were asked to slow to final approach speed 10 plus miles outside the final approach fix at 4;000 feet; and approach didn't give us an approach clearance until we had flown through the glide slope on the localizer; and had to join from above; in order to sequence aircraft landing [Runway] XYL; which started to compound our landing configuration planning; and a go around was not something we were hoping to do; especially off of a PAN PAN call. We later found that on a couple of occurrences; ATC did not pass the PANPAN or divert info from Center to Center to Approach. We were later reassigned upon arrival to fly a ZZZ3 Turn that left in 5 minutes.I told Company that we just went through a lot; and that if they wanted us to fly that turn; that I needed a break for an amount of time that I was setting; some food; and so the Captain and I went and had a sit down meal; decompressed; talked about what had happened; after an hour or so I assessed my fitness for duty and felt I was good to fly the turn. The Captain and I were sitting on the jet; and when we called for push going to ZZZ3; Ramp told us to hold and that Maintenance wanted to talk to us. The maintenance team member got on the radio; asked if we were the crew that brought Aircraft X in from ZZZ; I replied yes; and he told us we needed to fill out a fume report. Captain asked what he was talking about; and told him this was the first we have heard about any fume incident. The Maintainer on the radio said the Flight Attendants had filed a fume report after the flight; and we needed to do the same. The Flight Attendants never told us anything about fumes nor their intent to fill out any such reports. Captain then filed a fume report said he had no information to give for we knew nothing about it. I felt Captain had communicated very clearly what was going on to the flight attendants about the situation; and our intent to divert. They had never communicated any such issues during any duration of or after the flight. Unknown from the high temperature in the Aft Cargo Bay. We did later saw that Maintenance replaced the sensor in the aft cargo bay via the app. We were curious that with all the ZZZ team members in Training vests if maybe they stacked the bags in the aft cargo bay above the line and possibly covered the sensor or did something to It. However; As far as the 'suspected' fume event; there was no communication from the flight attendants to the cockpit crew for this event. We noticed via the app that Maintenance later deferred the APU to prevent 'further fume events' due to the suspected fume event we were later notified about from ZZZ2 Maintenance. Not sure why if there is a fume event (or even a suspected fume event) why they don't further investigate the problem or fix the problem; rather than just pencil whip it into deferment. If there was any fumes in this situation; how would MX (Maintenance) know they came from the APU and not from any potential problem we were encountering? Put quick reference limitations on a Cockpit Card or in the QRH or checklist to quickly reference for situations such as these. I felt like we were on an Easter egg hunt for something that we later found wasn't there which wasted a lot of our decision making time. I know that Airbus FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) and other manufacture manuals/reference material has such limitations for quick reference from my experience at a previous Airbus airline. Why can't the company get on board with Airbus??? Make sure Flight Attendants communicate to the cockpit if they were smelling fumes.,,,,A321 First Officer reported an abnormally elevated Aft Cargo Bay temperature during cruise. After conferring with maintenance; the flight executed a precautionary diversion for maintenance.,"The incident involved an A321 flight crew (Party 1) and a flight attendant (Party 2). During the flight, the crew noticed an abnormally high aft cargo bay temperature (194 degrees), which was above standard operating parameters. The crew consulted manuals and contacted maintenance but found no immediate solution. Concerned about the situation, particularly over water with limited diversion options, the crew decided to divert to ZZZ2. They made a PAN PAN call to inform ATC and contacted dispatch. During descent and landing at ZZZ2, the crew encountered challenges with overweight landing conditions and ATC communication, but the landing was uneventful. Post-landing, maintenance informed the crew that a fume report had been filed by the flight attendants, though the crew had no prior knowledge of fumes or related issues during the flight. Maintenance deferred the APU to prevent further fume events. The crew expressed concerns about the lack of communication from the flight attendants regarding the suspected fume event and questioned the adequacy of maintenance's response. They recommended improved communication protocols between the cockpit and cabin crew, better access to quick reference materials for such situations, and a more thorough investigation of potential issues instead of deferred fixes.",crew-related issues

The smart bag was relocated to passenger cabin prior to gate departure.,"The incident arose from a miscommunication between the flight captain and a flight attendant regarding the handling of a smart bag. Contributing factors included the inexperience of the new ops agent and flight attendant, as well as the captain's distraction while retrieving food, leading to a lack of direct involvement in the bag's handling. The flight attendant initially gate-checked the smart bag, which was later identified as requiring special handling. The ops agent retrieved the bag from the cargo area after being notified. During the flight, the captain noticed the bag in the cabin and pointed out the policy violation. The flight attendant acknowledged the mistake, and the bag's handling was corrected. The smart bag was erroneously loaded into the cargo compartment but was later moved to the passenger cabin. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and involvement by the captain, especially when dealing with safety-sensitive items like smart bags. The captain reflected on the need to be more involved in the handling of such items and recognized the impact of new staff and distractions on communication.

The first class wasn't even deplaned. Only three people had deplaned while others were trying to get their bag down and deplane. I said no not at this point; which in turn the first cleaner gave me serious attitude. The Gate Agent came down; no mask on; with an attitude about us not letting the cleaners enter to clean. They had 12 people to clean; usually they have a shortage of cleaners. But we hadn't even had first class passengers cleared and they started coming on.

I noticed the flight deck door was closed and had assumed she had done cabin secure for me seeing as I was tending to this passenger and she had done door closure for me. I continued on with the safety briefing. Approximately one minute into the safety briefing the Captain opened the flight deck door to inform me that no one informed him of cabin secure. Me and Flight Attendant X both became aware that we had assumed the other person had secured the cabin door and quickly re-secured the cabin. We continued on with our briefing.I believe we both made the mistake because of the destructive passenger. I had assumed that while I was tending to this passenger she had took over all of my duties and she assumed that I was going to finish my duties once I got back up into the gallery. I also believe the pilots close the door on their own to keep warm which is why we had gotten confused on the door being close.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being distracted by a disruptive passenger and forgetting to advise the flight crew the cabin was secure and they were ready to depart.,"The incident involved a misunderstanding between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding the cabin security process. The flight attendant was distracted by a disruptive passenger who refused to wear a mask, leading to an oversight in communication. After addressing the passenger, the flight attendant assumed the flight crew had been informed that the cabin was secure. Similarly, the flight crew believed the flight attendant had communicated the cabin's readiness. This mutual assumption resulted in the cabin not being properly secured before the safety briefing began. Approximately one minute into the briefing, the captain noticed the lack of communication and informed the flight attendant, prompting both parties to re-secure the cabin promptly. The incident was attributed to the distraction caused by the disruptive passenger and the crew's assumption that the other party had handled their respective duties. A potential solution identified was to improve communication protocols and account for habits like the pilots closing the flight deck door for warmth.",crew-related issues

This impedes the flow of deplaning passengers and obstructs the ability of flight attendants to manage the flow of passengers and maintain door and safety compliance. Cleaners are insisting that flight attendants leave the galley area so they can work; they say operations has told them to move the crew to accomplish the cleaning task. Allowing cleaners to pull carts and trash while flight attendants and passengers are deplaning creates safety hazards (bumps; trips; and impacts from trash removal) and does not allow for safe social distancing as per company policy.

They boarded the aircraft before all passengers had deplaned and entered the forward galley during the deplaning process, obstructing passenger flow and creating safety hazards. The cleaners insisted that flight attendants vacate the galley, claiming operational instructions. This led to safety concerns, including trip hazards from cleaning bags left on the floor. A flight attendant tripped over a gray cleaning tote, falling into the bulkhead. The flight attendant reported that cleaners were not following social distancing policies. A solution was proposed: cleaners should wait until all passengers have deplaned before boarding and avoid entering the galley while passengers are present.",crew-related issues

It was a busy time in the flight deck where I was trying to manage the safety of the push. The FO answered the call to the flight deck from the cabin while I was talking to the ground crew and ramp was talking to our flight and the flight next to us pushing off the gate. The ramp personnel had left several pieces of ground equipment in the way of our push from X1 and we were trying to find out about getting it moved. As all of that is going on the narrative that myself and the FO got from the FA seemed to be one of more a compliance with the mask policy than one of weight and balance. She told us there was a large child sitting in a seat for which they were ticketed next to their mother and the child was having a hard time wearing the mask. The FA told us that the mother was now saying the child was less than 2. The FA believed that the mother was saying the child was less than 2 to skirt our mask policy and we needed to change the count for weight and balance because the child was an infant. I tried to clarify with the FA about the child because it was not clear to me because she was telling me the child was not listed as an infant; had their own seat; and by the FAs thought it was more about the mask. My thinking was that for the child to have that seat a birth date would have to be listed when that seat was purchased. Previously the FAs and the gate agent had reconciled the count; and the FA thought the child was older than 2; so I elected to leave the weight and balance as it stood. We continued to our destination without further incident.It was a busy time in the flight deck when this issue was brought to my attention. After things had calmed down with push I should have checked back with the FA to make sure I was hearing everything she was trying to tell me. Factors for me with my decision making were the high workload at the time; alertness because of the late time of day of the departure and having been scheduled with early AM shows for the three days prior to this event.,,I walked through to do my cabin count and confirmed that I had a child in row XX just as it showed on the sheet. I had already asked the mom to get a mask on the child before we closed the weight/balance. She said the child did not have a mask so I brought her one. After the safety demo I walked through the cabin again for final compliance and saw the child was not wearing a mask. Mom said he had ripped it so I offered to get a new one. She then said that the other FA told her he didn't need one if he was under the age of 2. I was surprised to hear the child was an infant as he was quite large and had walked on board the aircraft by himself. I asked if he was still only 1 and she said he was not yet 2. I alerted the CA that I had possibly made a mistake in the count.  I mistakenly counted an infant as a child. I didn't ask how old the child was; it only came up because of non-compliance with mask policy.I honestly think she claimed the child was an infant in order to avoid dealing with the face mask.In the future I will make sure to ask passengers with small children if they are in fact under the age of 2.,,Air carrier Captain and a Flight Attendant reported a passenger's child was resisting wearing a face mask. After this problem started the parent then stated the child was under 2 and did not need to wear the face mask.,"The incident began when a flight attendant reported a passenger's child resisting the face mask policy. The mother claimed the child was under two years old, exempting the child from the mask requirement. The flight attendant believed this was an attempt to avoid compliance and sought to adjust the weight and balance count. The captain, managing a busy pushback and fatigued from early morning hours, decided to maintain the current count, as the child had a designated seat, suggesting the child was over two. Later, the flight attendant realized she had miscounted the child as a passenger rather than an infant, leading her to alert the captain. She concluded the mother had falsely claimed the child's age. Reflecting on the experience, the flight attendant vowed to verify the age of children in such situations in the future. The outcome was resolved without further incident, with the flight attendant learning to ask passengers about their child's age to ensure accurate counts and compliance.",crew-related issues

We called back to the FA's (Flight Attendants) who said they were finishing up service and would come up when they could. When they called up; they gave the code word as normal. I did a positive exchange of controls to the Captain since it was my PF (Pilot Flying) leg. He took controls as normal. Door unlocked and the crew swap went normal. Upon finishing in the lavatory the B FA called up to begin the next crew exchange. She informed me that the CA wanted to use the lavatory too. I was waiting in the galley expecting the A FA to come out so we could do the normal process of me sitting down; getting controls back; getting any flight updates; and then having the FA's call back up so the CA could use the lav. Instead; the flight deck door opened and out walked the CA. No one was at the controls; the A FA was in the process of moving from my seat to the CA seat. I immediately said 'she's supposed to come out first; no one is at the controls'. The CA responded 'oh; right' or something along those lines. The B FA and myself expressed our concerns over the incorrect lavatory exchange procedure. He then proceeded to open the lavatory door. Not go back into the flight deck. I rushed into the flight deck; sat down; got myself situated and locked the door since there was no pilot. I got the aviate; navigate done and now wanted to communicate. I asked the A FA what happened and she said 'I don't really know; he told me to switch seats with him so we squeezed past each other'. I told her that's not normal and that I needed to talk to the CA. The B FA called up; said the code word; and the CA came back in. I talked to him about what happened and he said something like 'oh right; that did seem strange'. I talked to him about the correct procedure which he; I assume; did not know. I told him we had no one at the controls and how dangerous that is. Upon getting to the hotel the FA's asked me if I was going to fill out a report. I called the Pilot Union Professional Standards to get their opinion on the situation.

The First Officer had informed the Captain of the need to use the lavatory, and the flight attendants (FAs) were expected to manage the cockpit exchange. However, during the crew swap, the flight deck door was opened, and the Captain entered the cockpit while no pilot was seated at the controls. Simultaneously, the A FA was in the process of moving from the FO's seat to the Captain's seat, creating a dangerous situation. The FO returned to the cockpit, retook control, and addressed the unsafe procedure with the Captain. The B FA also expressed concerns about the improper exchange.

Another FA (Flight Attendant) who was scheduled to work 5/Y/21 ZZZ-ZZZ3-ZZZ2 would replace our A FA. At first the C FA and myself (B FA) thought the A FA would have to DH (Deadhead) on our flight and both the C FA and myself decided to take an earlier van ride to avoid any further distress caused by the A FA. But once C FA and myself realized the A FA was to work ZZZ-ZZZ3-ZZZ2 the C FA and me were relieved and comfortable to take the original van time of XA30am. When van came to pick up the D FA; C FA and myself our original A FA showed up as if nothing happened the previous day. On the previous day once the entire crew arrived to the hotel the A FA verbally attacked the Captain and First Officer. The A FA's hostility towards the pilots made the entire crew uncomfortable. I myself was visibly shaken by the A FA yelling and verbal attack on the pilots. Upon arriving to the airport the A FA walked off without us like the previous two days leaving us behind. When the C FA; D FA and me got to the gate the pilots were waiting in the gate area for us to discuss what we all were going to do as we were all in shock that the A FA was back on the trip without our knowledge of any change. The Captain was still backing up the decision to have the A FA removed but then it came down to what to do. The company put us in a situation making us work with the A FA whose behavior distressed the crew enough to adversely affect our work and well-being at work. The company's decision to have the A FA continue to work the flight created an unhealthy work environment. The crew was nervous and uncomfortable not knowing if there were to be another disturbance. It wasn't as if the flight was only an hour long we were flying across the ocean with nowhere to land if another disturbance were to arise. The C FA; D FA and myself all stayed away from the A FA as much as possible to avoid any further outbursts.,,The day prior after landing in ZZZ and arriving at the hotel; I; as well as the entire crew; had a situation happen with the A Flight Attendant. After speaking with the Chief Pilot as well as the Supervisor in the Operations Center; the decision was made to have the A Flight Attendant removed from her next flight. This decision was reached between the Supervisor and the B FA and C FA. I informed the Supervisor that I even thought I was OK with flying back with the A Flight Attendant. The B and C Flight Attendants were not; and that I was backing them up and would not force or require them to fly with her; against their wishes. The Supervisor said she would pull the A FA from the trip and we would have a new A FA. The situation was so bad that the B FA and C FA did not want to ride in the same van with the A FA the next day. The following day; when we reported for work; we found out that someone had put the original A FA back on the trip without notifying myself or the rest of the crew.I personally found out 45 minutes prior to departure; when I was given the paperwork to review and noticed her name on the Crew sheet. The B; C and D Flight Attendants were extremely upset about the situation and they were put in a very difficult position standing at the gate with over 160 people who were traveling back to the mainland. I asked the 3 Flight Attendants if they were going to be able to work with the A FA and also called the Operations Center to inform the Chief Pilot and the Supervisor about the situation. After the B; C; and D Flight Attendants agreed to work with her and we departed ZZZ.

On 5/X/21, it was decided to replace the FA for the flight on 5/Y/21, but the replacement was not communicated clearly to the crew. Initially, the crew believed the FA would deadhead (ride without working), but upon discovering she was to work the flight, they were relieved. However, the FA's previous hostile behavior toward the pilots caused the crew significant discomfort, especially after she reappeared on the flight without prior notification. On the day of departure, the crew was shocked to find the FA back on the trip, leading to an awkward and tense atmosphere. The Captain supported removing the FA but faced the dilemma of proceeding with the flight. The company's decision to keep the FA on the flight despite her disruptive behavior created an unhealthy work environment, leaving the crew nervous and unsure about the flight's safety.

They catered the front next. Upon completing catering; and when the R1 door was closed; I noticed that the warning strap was across the window. I immediately called it out and said 'why is that strap across the window'? The door was obviously disarmed as there was no slide deployment. D Flight Attendant was with me. The CSA (Customer Service Associate); who was waiting at the R1 door; then said 'you gave the caters a thumbs up when they knocked and the strapped was attached' which I do not recall doing. D Flight Attendant didn't see the warning strap in the armed position when she boarded the plane either. I immediately moved the warning strap to the disarmed position and noticed that the velcro strap on the extension piece was worn out to the point where the extension would not stay attached. It constantly fell down and hung.I told the First Officer as she was leaving the flight deck that we had an issue with the R1 warning strap. She indicated that they were about to time out and discounted my comment. I made her look at the strap. She came to the door and said 'no; it works; see'. I showed her that 4/5 attempts to place the strap on the Velcro didn't work; it would fall down. She said 'well you gotta talk to the Captain about it' and then entered the bathroom. I then proceeded to talk to the Captain. He stopped me before I even started and said 'if you tell me anything I am obligated to put it in the book; so is this really important?' I said yes; I have an issue with the warning strap. He also indicated that they had a timing issue and couldn't take any delays. I told them that I needed Maintenance. Maintenance came and fixed the strap. I don't know what happened with the strap being across the window in the armed position. I can only speculate that catering attached it while it was hanging down. If it was in place; they shouldn't have opened the door; the CSA should have also said something as she was waiting by L1; apparently watching; and the entire inbound crew should have checked upon deplaning. I find it odd that all of these checks would have been missed. Furthermore; I didn't appreciate being put in a position where I had to make the call if we were going to take a potential delay and possibly cancel the flight due to a timing out issue. My only job is to bring cabin discrepancies to the captain's attention. This was a poor example of CRM. This morning; I had a conversation with the Captain regarding the events yesterday and reiterated what I have written in this [report]; about poor CRM and putting me in an uncomfortable situation. He agreed and said they handled the situation poorly. As we are flying together today on an ETOPS flight to ZZZ; I didn't want to there be any communication issue before we left.

We left for our next flight. We had a medical incident onboard during the flight. While our CRM was effective; there were many decisions to be made. While our country is currently in a national emergency; any serious medical event leads to uncertainty. All three flight attendants were in constant communication with the Captain. At first we were told no passengers could leave the aircraft when we landed. We had passengers who were aware of the situation and wanted to be involved. Of course our first priority was the safety of our passengers and crew; we also were aware of the effect any decision would have on the company. After discussion with Station Ops and Dispatch; the Captain was instructed to not hold the passengers; and that the aircraft would be cleaned upon arrival. We also spent the entire flight containing the incident so all passengers felt at ease about their safety. I felt we were successful. However; in this coronavirus environment; it was very stressful and we had to remain calm and in control. We were dealing with many different situations and important decisions during the flight.,,After the deplaning of Flight XYZ from ZZZ to ZZZ1; the one of the crew members failed to stay with the XX through passengers. During this flight; we encountered many distractions including a passenger that vomited in the forward lav and we alerted the Captain due to the national concern over the scare of the coronavirus. The crew maintained excellent CRM skills when communicating with the flight deck. The flight deck notified medical service and Dispatch. I was also comforting a woman who was flying to see her gravely ill mother.,,Flight Attendants reported concerns about a sick passenger in their flight.,"The incident was triggered by a medical situation involving a sick passenger on board a flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1. The flight attendants encountered a vomit episode in the forward lavatory, attributed to a national health concern, and promptly alerted the captain. They maintained effective communication with the flight deck, ensuring the situation was managed with care. The crew coordinated with medical services,Dispatch, and Station Ops, leading to the decision to allow passengers to deplane after the aircraft was cleaned. Additionally, the attendants comforted a passenger whose mother was gravely ill. The flight attendants successfully managed the medical incident, ensuring passenger safety and comfort. Passengers were permitted to deplane post-cleaning, adhering to safety protocols amidst the pandemic, thus resolving the situation effectively.",crew-related issues

The aircraft was put on a hardstand with no tug where with guidance from the ramp crew we would be able to start both engines and be directed to the movement area of the ramp. After completing the Engine Start Check; I looked over to the Ramper and with their permission; I released the parking brake. I however; did not reengage the parking brake. I then directed the First Officer to start both engines. The number 2 engine was started first. Following the start of the number 1 engine; the First Officer stepped on the brakes and simultaneously engaged the parking brake. This caused the airplane to stop abruptly. I asked the First Officer why he did what he did; and he said that we were moving. I then said that it was my mistake for not having the parking brake engaged; but we were moving slowly and we were far from any equipment and people. I then asked the First Officer two questions Why did he not say to me that the aircraft was moving and I would have applied the brakes and why did he apply both the brakes and the parking brake at the same time ? He said that he was not sure the brakes alone would have stopped the airplane. We then proceeded with the rest of the normal checklists and taxied to the runway and departed. In flight; the Flight Attendant said she was injured from the whiplash and was bruised. She said she may see a doctor upon reaching our destination. At the end of the flight I exchanged my contact information with the Flight Attendant to keep me informed of her physical condition. The whole sequence of events started with me not engaging the parking brake after releasing it for the out time. The threat of not recognizing that we do not have rampers to tell us to reset the brake after push was not addressed during our threat discussion and mitigation. My error was not seeing the airplane moving after the number one engine started and stopping the airplane before the First Officer. The undesired state was the fact that the aircraft moved when it should not have causing potential harm to the ramp crew and outside equipment. The other error I would say was CRM. The First Officer acted in the interest of safety and was the first to recognize the movement of the aircraft. He however over reacted. Based on the fact the airplane was moving slowly and we were far from rampers and equipment; I think he should have told me that we were moving and I would have stopped the airplane. If I did not react he then should have stepped on the brakes. This was the error on CRM our part. After talking to him I found out that he just finished IOE recently and this was his first trip after completing IOE. I think lack of experience in actual line operations caused him to act the way he did. I also should have checked with the Flight Attendant to see how she was doing after the airplane came to a stop. What I learned was to be extra vigilant when you are taxiing out with no towbar from the gate. If we were close to people or equipment; this could have been bad. Addressing ramp operations with no tug driver telling you to 'set the brake' is a threat that we should have discussed and talked about. I also need to be more aware of aircraft (unintentional) movement in all situations and react appropriately.,,,,ERJ145 Captain reported the parked aircraft began rolling on the ramp and the First Officer put the brakes on and the parking brake causing an abrupt stop injuring a Flight Attendant.,"The incident involved an ERJ145 aircraft during its morning flight. The captain released the parking brake but failed to re-engage it, causing the aircraft to move on the ramp after the engines were started. The first officer, noticing the movement, applied both the brakes and the parking brake, resulting in an abrupt stop. A flight attendant sustained injuries from the sudden stop, including whiplash and bruising. The primary causes of the incident were the captain's oversight in not re-engaging the parking brake after releasing it and the first officer's overreaction to the aircraft's movement. The captain acknowledged a lapse in vigilance during ramp operations without proper communication from ground staff and attributed the first officer's actions to his recent completion of initial operating experience (IOE), indicating a lack of line operation experience. The captain learned the importance of being more vigilant when taxiing without a tug and emphasized the need to address ramp operation threats during pre-flight briefings. Additionally, the incident highlighted the importance of effective crew resource management (CRM) and clear communication to prevent similar occurrences.",crew-related issues

I realize passengers wearing their own masks could think it would be alright to put the oxygen mask over their face mask based on my incorrect demonstration.I went into my trip misinterpreting and misreading communication regarding face masks; which led me to think I would just need to wear my face mask throughout the flight without understanding that there are exceptions and appropriate situations during which to remove the face mask. While completing my safety demonstration; I do not think I realized I was wearing my face mask as I was demonstrating the use of the demonstration oxygen mask. I believe that I was also narrowly focused on keeping up with the demonstration rather than being situationally aware of the fact that I was still wearing a mask as I went into the oxygen mask demonstration.Looking back on this event; I realize I could have been more aware of myself and my surroundings. Before I started the trip; I simply thought that I would just need to wear my mask for the duration of my flights without comprehending that in certain moments of the flight; such as demonstrating correct use of the oxygen mask; that it would be appropriate to remove my mask in order to safely and accurately show its proper use. I plan to be more situationally aware; realizing that I may need to remove my mask for certain tasks. I will now remove my mask for the pre-departure demonstration in order to show how to properly use and wear the oxygen mask.,,,,Flight Attendant reported wearing a personal face mask while demonstrating oxygen mask use during the pre-departure safety briefing. The Flight Attendant was concerned that passengers would think it would be acceptable to place an oxygen mask over a personal mask.,"The flight attendant was demonstrating the oxygen mask use during the safety briefing while wearing her own face mask, which could have led passengers to misunderstand the correct procedure.

Passenger X was upset because a passenger in front of her had removed their mask while drinking coffee, which she perceived as a violation of mask-wearing rules. The flight attendant explained that it is permitted for passengers to lower their masks while eating or drinking. Despite this explanation, Passenger X remained confused and continued to express her concerns.

The flight attendant attempted to address Passenger X's frustration by explaining that the flight was weight-restricted, which limited their ability to accommodate seat changes. The attendant also had the Customer Service Supervisor intervene to assist in resolving the situation. However, after the aircraft took off, Passenger X became upset again when two gentlemen in another row (row Y) took their seats, which had been moved at the gate. Passenger X questioned why she could not move while the gentlemen could, despite the gate staff having already adjusted their seating.

During the interaction, Passenger X raised her voice and became increasingly confrontational, citing concerns about her dying father and her fear of COVID-19 exposure.

Upon entering the restroom, Passenger X was heard coughing heavily, to the point of gagging, which worried two other passengers. When asked about his condition, he initially claimed it was due to allergies but later stated he was not feeling well because he had not eaten breakfast. The FA provided snack bags to all passengers and kept a close eye on Passenger X throughout the flight. Additionally, Passenger X was repeatedly reminded to wear his mask properly. The FA noted that he was reading or digging through his bags, which may have contributed to the need for mask reminders. The FA informed the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) about the situation, and the PIC requested that the FA check if there was a way to take Passenger X's temperature. Since the crew did not have a thermometer, the PIC suggested contacting a customer service agent to meet the flight. After landing, the PIC instructed the FA to ask Passenger X to remain seated until all other passengers had deplaned, so that someone could speak with him privately. Passenger X complied but was visibly unhappy and removed his mask in frustration. After noticing the FA's surprise, he quickly put the mask back on.

The blood [was] intentionally smeared into an X shape on the wall. I presumed the blood came from tearing open a scab or some other small wound. It was a clearly visible amount but didn't indicate heavy bleeding.By the time [deplaning] was complete and I could go to row XX; most of the moisture from the saliva and nasal secretions had dried and was barely visible; only the blood stood out. Without their notification; and even with the easily visible blood; it would have been impossible to realize the extent to which they had contaminated every possible surface. It would have dried completely had we taken the time to tidy the aircraft first. In our PA about passenger compliance we emphasize seat belts and smoking and perhaps that is outdated and detracts from where the emphasis currently should lie. We state federal law prohibits tampering with a lav smoke detector; perhaps we have a law that prohibits passenger misconduct and could be stated in such a way that explains the criminality (if any) to such behavior. I do not believe those passengers believed they could face any consequence for these actions. Regardless of taking place during a pandemic; at any time this behavior poses a risk to other passengers; crew; and employees.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that two passengers were observed spitting; and wiping their saliva and blood over their entire seating area.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and two passengers (Party2) in seats XX5 and XX6. During deplaning, several passengers approached the flight attendant to report that the two passengers had been spitting, wiping saliva, phlegm, and blood over their seating area, including seats, armrests, tray tables, window, and wall. The two passengers exited the aircraft before the other passengers could notify the flight attendant. The flight attendant terminated the flight and informed Operations to request cleaners to sanitize the affected area thoroughly. The blood was smeared in an X shape on the wall, likely from a small wound. The flight attendant noted that without the passengers' notification, the extent of the contamination would have gone unnoticed, as the saliva and secretions had dried by the time she could inspect the area. The flight attendant reflected on the need for updated passenger announcements to emphasize the seriousness of such misconduct and the potential consequences. No immediate solution was proposed for the passengers' actions, but the flight attendant emphasized the importance of addressing such behavior to protect other passengers, crew, and employees.",crew-related issues

I called F/D and let them know of the situation and asked to hold pushback until aft FAs determined whether Passenger X should continue on the flight. Passenger X complied initially and we departed without further issue.During cruise F/A B communicated to me that he had asked Passenger X several times to keep his mask on - as he was not eating or drinking. I went aft and asked Passenger X to wear his mask as well; which he had stuffed into his pocket. He was visibly annoyed and didn't initially comply. As he was connecting on another flight; we also notified pilots of the situation. Passenger X; was non-compliant with face mask.Better policy/procedure is needed between FA; Pilot; and station workgroups and their roles. It doesn't feel particularly safe to send someone who is knowingly non-compliant onto another crew or CSA.,,During boarding I observed Passenger X; without his face mask on and asked him to please pull his mask up; which he did. After the demo as I walked to the back; I observed Passenger X with his face mask down again. I told him to put it up. And then I reminded him that he had agreed to wear a face mask is a condition of flying with us this evening. I told him I was not playing games. I told him; this could jeopardize his ability to fly with this airline in the future. I asked him if he understood and he said he did. Later on; after the service; I was going through the cabin picking up trash and observed Passenger X without a face mask. It was not on his face around his neck. It was nowhere to be seen. I looked him squarely in the face. He saw me looking at him and made no move to put his face mask on again. I called the A FA and told her about [the] issue. She came back and told Passenger X to put his face mask on and he did. We conferred and I explained that I had warned him twice earlier. He is connecting to ZZZ tonight or later on this morning. The flight deck has been apprised of his actions.,,Flight attendants reported a passenger needed to be continuously reminded about having to wear a face mask.,"An incident occurred involving a passenger, identified as Passenger X, who repeatedly failed to comply with the airline's face mask policy during a flight. The flight attendant (F/A B) observed Passenger X without a face mask during boarding and reminded him to wear it. Initially compliant, Passenger X later removed his mask again during the safety demonstration. The flight attendant warned him that wearing a mask was a condition for flying and reiterated this during the flight when Passenger X was observed without his mask, despite previous reminders. The flight attendant informed the pilots and considered whether to allow Passenger X to continue his journey, as he was connecting to another flight. Passenger X eventually complied after further intervention, but the flight attendant expressed concerns about existing policies and suggested the need for improved procedures to handle such situations more effectively. Passenger X's repeated non-compliance with face mask policy despite multiple reminders. Initial compliance, subsequent non-compliance, and repeated warnings by flight attendants, leading to notification of the flight deck. Passenger X complied after further intervention, but concerns about handling non-compliant passengers were raised.

Lead FA (Purser) stated that none of the FAs were comfortable coming up to the Cockpit unless the remaining pilot (in the cockpit) wore a face covering. As he really needed to use the Lav; the FO consented to the FA's request and then told me (the Captain) of the FA's request. This is the first time in my XX+ years at airline and XY+ years as a Captain; that I've had a FA hold me hostage to get a Lav break. The FA requested that the pilot remaining in the cockpit wear a face covering in the cockpit while the other pilot was absent from the cockpit on the Lav break. I never wear a face covering in the cockpit; while flying the aircraft; especially with the other pilot absent from the cockpit.If it's not already obvious; let me restate that the FARs prohibit the use of a face covering (or the wearing of a beard) that would prevent a proper seal of the O2 mask. At FL400 and a TUC (Time of Useful Consciousness) of 15 seconds; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to find out that your O2 mask doesn't work with a face covering. As the FO left the cockpit; and me wearing a face covering; per the FA's request; ATC gave us a vector off course and a speed reduction for traffic. I replied to ATC; but they couldn't hear my boom mike through the face covering. At FL400; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to find out ATC can't hear your boom mike through the face covering. Before she left; I told the Lead FA that I would be writing a report and she said something through her face covering that I couldn't hear. At FL400; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to be unable to communicate with the only other person in the cockpit.Face coverings are UN-SAFE while taxing; flying; or maneuvering the airplane. They fog up my glasses which I am required to wear; they prevent me from communicating clearly with ATC; the other pilot or with the FA when the other pilot is absent from the cockpit.After the flight; we had a long debrief with the FAs. Company COVID-19 face covering information DOES NOT address the wearing of a face covering while operating an aircraft. The FAs on this flight; believed I was operating the aircraft in disregard of the Federal Aviation Regulations and in direct violation of Company Policy. It was unclear to these FAs; who gets to tell who must wear a face covering while operating an aircraft. None of these FAs seemed to understand who the Pilot-In-Command (PIC) is when operating an aircraft.In the masked de-brief; they were argumentative and confrontational. They thought that the remaining pilot on the cockpit was required to wear an O2 mask anytime the other pilot is absent the cockpit. It is very difficult to discuss face coverings with a FA who's been told that everyone is required to wear a face covering at all times while on an aircraft or on company property. The FAs do not understand the problems caused by face coverings in the cockpit (the O2 mask; Pilot to Pilot or Pilot to ATC communications issues; or Eye Glass fogging). The FAs believe that they can tell the Captain how to operate an aircraft in direct violation of the FARs; safety procedures and common sense. This has to stop. The Company must tell all employees; but especially FAs; that the Captain is in command; that face coverings cause safety issues in the cockpit and that pilots are NOT required (in fact; are discouraged from wearing) face coverings while operating an aircraft.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported that the flight attendants were not comfortable coming into the flight deck while the pilot was on a restroom break; until the remaining pilot was wearing a face mask. Reporter described safety concerns with having to wear a face mask in the cockpit.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and flight attendants regarding the safety protocols for wearing face coverings in the cockpit. Here's a concise summary: During the flight, the First Officer requested a Lavatory break. The Lead Flight Attendant insisted that no flight attendant would enter the cockpit unless the remaining pilot wore a face covering. The Captain complied but was angered, feeling it was unprecedented and unsafe. The Captain highlighted safety issues with face coverings in the cockpit, citing potential problems with oxygen masks, communication with ATC, and fogging of glasses. These concerns were particularly acute at FL400, where quick response times are critical. The use of a face covering muffled communication, leading to difficulties in contacting ATC and the Lead FA, further complicating the situation. Post-landing, the debrief with FAs became confrontational. FAs believed the Captain was violating safety protocols by not wearing a face covering and didn't understand the Captain's authority as PIC. The Captain emphasized the need for clear company policies on face coverings in the cockpit, noting that current COVID-19 guidelines don't address this specific scenario. They stressed the importance of recognizing the PIC's authority and the hazards face coverings pose in the cockpit environment. In conclusion, the incident underscored the need for improved communication, policy clarity, and understanding of safety protocols among all crew members.",crew-related issues

He called the Captain and told him that it was me who wants to keep it close.I told Captain what was going on; FA 1 still refused to do right thing. He locked the back lavatory (put a sticker out of service) on the back lavatory door. It is so wrong. I could not fix this problem. He was very condescending. I told him if he doesn't feel safe with customers he shouldn't be here. We can't make the customers uncomfortable and stop them from using lavatory.,,,,Flight Attendant reported another Flight Attendant locked the bathroom door and put an out of order sign on it; so he would not have to get close to people.,"The incident occurred between two flight attendants (FA1 and FA2) during a flight. FA1 locked the lavatory and blocked the jumpseat area with a curtain, citing discomfort near passengers. FA2 objected, explaining that such measures were only justified for wheelchair passengers. FA1 contacted the captain, attributing the issue to FA2. Despite FA2 informing the captain, FA1 persisted. FA2 suggested that if FA1 felt unsafe, he should not be there, emphasizing the need to ensure passenger comfort.

I called Captain and asked him to let me check on situation and I would call him right back after.  He said OK. I went back and asked passenger if they were in the exit row or did they move and she said she moved because she wanted a window seat. I explained I needed her to move back to her original seat as we had not briefed her for the exit row. I told her I would come back and explain more about why after we got in the air.  She moved back. I went back to my FWD jumpseat and called the Captain to tell him we were secure and passenger was back in her seat. AFT FA made a PA telling passenger of need to keep masks on then told me that same passenger had removed hers. As he walked up during our service in flight he said he thought he noticed a beer bottle on her seat tray. I asked him if he wanted me to check and he said yes. I walked back and there was an open beer bottle can on her tray. I asked her what was in the bottle and asked if it was an X brand beer and alcohol. She said yes and I told her she could not have her alcohol on board.  She asked why but said OK; and I took it and showed the aft FA in the galley then threw it away and immediately called the flight deck. The FO apparently answered and I told him the same passenger that had tried to move in to the exit row and we had a mask issue with had an open beer on her tray that we took from. I told him she did not appear drunk as she was answering my questions clearly and cognitively; but had a little smart attitude.  During the rest of the flight I continued to collect trash in the aisle about every 10 minutes to check on her. It seemed she had 2 other friends in the exit row area that she was talking to that she kept looking back at then looked at us to see if we were watching but she didn't seem to be doing anything else wrong until she removed her mask then the aft FA gave her a warning and she kept her mask on after that except for drinking some water the other FA said he thought it was.  After we deplaned another passenger in seat Z4; said as he deplaned - Do you want to talk to me? I said yes the Captain would because at that point I wasn't sure what he meant but he had given me eye contact during the flight like he did not know what to think of the passenger.  Another passenger deplaned who had been sitting in A2 was not happy with the passenger either apparently. Passenger in Z4 told the Captain on the jet bridge that she had been saying swear words and how she was going to write a letter to airline and what she was going to do the other FA and I?  The passenger had never slurred words or acted incoherent so there was never a sign of intoxication to us. I explained that again to the Captain as well.

FA A did not allow passengers to pass through the forward galley during boarding to expedite the boarding process. FA B tried his best to direct traffic at the 1L door. Due to FA A blocking traffic from coming through the forward galley passengers were only able to get to their seat using the aircraft left aisle until they reached the mid galley. This caused a delay for departure. We still had bags out and overhead bins open when the FA A made the PA that the boarding door had been closed; and to arm our doors. I ran forward and told her we were still getting bags put away; and still had open overhead bins. She stated the agent had closed the door. I stated that she should have told them we were not ready to close the boarding door. After that; all FAs armed doors and tried to get all bags and overhead bins taken care of as quickly as possible. We then felt ground movement. I looked out of the window. We had started moving backwards. We had not received an All Call; and we were still trying to get all bags stowed and overhead bins closed. I (FA C) grabbed the phone at my jumpseat and made an All Call. The FA A hung up the phone almost as soon as she answered. She simply stated her name. I stated my name and that I initiated an All Call since she had not and we were pushing back. Note that this also means she had closed the flight deck door. If the flight deck door was closed then the flight deck must have thought we were seated and stowed; when in fact we were not. After she answered her phone and stated her name; and I stated I had started the All Call; she hung up. The rest of us proceeded with stating our doors had been armed and cross checked. My phone then rang. I answered the phone stating my name. FA A stated she was now performing the All Call. I stated we had just done the All Call. She then hung up her phone. FA A also would not make the COVID-19/mask announcement. FA D made the required PA. FA A had stated to FA E that she knew one of us (FA D or myself) would make it; since she was not going to make it. We did not know she was not going to make the PA and waited until he made the decision to just make the PA since we were not hearing it being made by her.The FA A needs to be spoken to about the FARs that were violated; as well as procedures that MUST be followed. This created a very chaotic and potentially hazardous environment for all on board. Passengers and crew.,,,,Flight Attendant reported communication and procedural issues experienced with another Flight Attendant.,"The incident involved a conflict between two flight attendants (FA A and FA B) during the boarding and pre-flight preparation process. The conflict arose due to discrepancies in their communication and adherence to established procedures. FA A restricted passengers from using the forward galley during boarding, causing congestion and delays. FA B attempted to manage the boarding process at the 1L door but was hindered by FA A's actions, leading to a slower boarding procedure. After boarding was underway, FA A prematurely closed the boarding door and armed the doors without ensuring all bags and overhead bins were secured. When FA C, another flight attendant, attempted to address this by making an All Call, FA A hung up the phone and failed to complete the required COVID-19/mask announcement. FA A admitted to knowing that another flight attendant would have to make the announcement, as she was not going to do so. This resulted in confusion and a potentially hazardous situation, as the flight deck door was closed, creating the impression that the cabin was ready for takeoff when it was not. The incident concluded with FA A's alleged procedural violations and communication issues being brought to light, necessitating corrective action, such as addressing the FARs and procedures she may have violated.

The flight attendant politely requested compliance with the mask policy and instructed the passenger to prepare for landing by buckling his seatbelt and adjusting his seat to an upright position. The passenger refused, shaking his head, putting his fingers in his ears, and repeatedly saying, ""No, I am not going to wear my mask right now."" Despite the flight attendant's repeated requests, the passenger ignored her instructions. The passenger's flightmate intervened, urging him to comply with the seatbelt and seat position requirements. The passenger, however, continued to refuse, stating he would not wear his seatbelt and wanted to go to the bathroom. The flight attendant asked the flightmate if the passenger was okay, to which she responded, ""Yes,"" but then firmly instructed the passenger to buckle his seatbelt and adjust his seat. The passenger eventually complied with the seatbelt and seat position but verbally refused to wear the mask. The flight attendant then requested the flightmate's assistance in persuading the passenger to put on his mask, explaining that refusal to comply with the mask policy could result in the passenger being banned from flying. Despite these efforts, the passenger persisted in his refusal. The flight attendant informed both passengers that the Captain and Gate Agent would be notified of the passenger's refusal to comply with the mask policy, and appropriate actions would be taken. Upon arrival, the Gate Agent spoke to the passenger, who refused to engage in conversation. The flightmate, however, stated that the passenger refused to wear the mask because he ""couldn't hear"" and was ""sleeping."" These claims were later determined to be untrue.

Requested FA B to check as she worked on compliance to ensure passenger's mask was properly donned. It appeared it came down again. During demo he leaned his head in so I did not have a clear view but requested a third time for guest to adhere to the policy of the nose being fully covered. He expressed concern he had trouble seeing. I apologized but thanked him for adherence to the policy indicating it is not fun for anyone. Prior to taxi FA B and I discussed what the next steps would be as this had been the third request for compliance already. I relayed what appeared to be the root of the issue and we concurred if he had his mask properly donned no further action would be needed.Please have the gate engage with guests before they are allowed to board: 95% of the issues could be resolved if this was followed. Having FA's be the last line is really not great during the pandemic and it appears gate partners are no longer actively enforcing the policy change that occurred on [date].,,Passenger was notified by both FA A and B to cover nose with face covering. For final compliance guest had nose covered.,,Flight attendants reported a passenger was not complying with wearing a face mask and had to be told three times to wear it correctly.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (FA) and a passenger regarding the proper wearing of a face mask in compliance with policy. The passenger was observed with a mask that did not fully cover the nose. The flight attendant requested compliance multiple times, with the passenger initially appearing reluctant but eventually adjusting the mask. Despite this, the mask appeared to slip down again, prompting a third request. The passenger expressed difficulty seeing with the mask but ultimately complied. The flight attendant and another crew member discussed the situation before taxi, noting that such issues could be mitigated if gate staff enforced mask policies before boarding, reducing the burden on flight attendants during the pandemic. The passenger complied with the policy after the third request.",crew-related issues

Although we make the announcements about masks often and model proper behavior; passengers often forget to pull the mask up to cover nose and mouth; letting it rest on chin.  What is especially problematic is that when I am serving; many pull it down and talk right at my face.  I step back and ask and motion to them to pull it up but often they seem confused.  This happens many many times on each flight.   Merely making announcements doesn't seem to do the trick.  Serving does not feel safe for me as a result.  It may seem like a silly idea; but what about a role play with the two flight attendants after takeoff in front of cabin to demonstrate not to pull down mask?  Sort of like the safety demo; with a set script where the one pretends to pull down mask and the other says 'Please don't do that!'It's worth a try.  It could stick in people's heads better with a demo; based on teaching techniques.,,,,Flight Attendant reported problems associated with passengers wearing face masks improperly.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and passengers regarding improper face mask usage during a flight. The flight attendant reported that passengers frequently failed to wear masks correctly, with some pulling them down to talk while she was serving. Despite repeated announcements and reminders, this issue persisted, creating a sense of unsafe working conditions for the flight attendant. As a proposed solution, the flight attendant suggested a role play demonstration after takeoff, where two flight attendants would simulate the proper use of masks, similar to the safety demo, to help passengers better understand the importance of mask adherence. The flight attendant expressed a desire for this approach to be considered to address the recurring issue.",crew-related issues

The passenger claimed to have a medical condition that prevented him from wearing a mask, but this was not documented in the crew's records. The flight attendant reminded the passenger of the policy, but he remained non-compliant. The breakdown in the situation was attributed to a lack of effective Crew Resource Management (CRM).

The captain refused, citing the need to hold an open bottle of water. Post-flight, the captain questioned the mask policy and criticized the flight attendant for being ""demanding."" The flight attendant emphasized the captain's role in setting safety standards and felt the captain's actions were non-compliant with procedures. Key considerations include the justification for the captain's refusal, the impact on passenger safety perceptions, and the need for clear policies and training to handle such situations. Solutions may involve updating guidelines to accommodate mask-wearing while managing items, improving communication strategies, and reinforcing the importance of safety protocols. The incident underscores the balance between safety and practicality, highlighting the need for effective conflict resolution and policy enforcement.",crew-related issues

He stated that he was not seated during takeoff; his galley was not secure; and that coffee had spilled on himself and his iPad. He then went on to state that the reason he was not able to complete his tasks prior to pushback and departure was because he was having to deal with passengers and their improper usage of masks. The B; C; and D Flight Attendants did not mention any passenger issues to us.As the First Officer; take a more proactive role in ensuring the flight attendants acknowledge the single ring prior to takeoff.  Also; it is my understanding that the flight attendants are supposed to immediately inform the pilots of any disruption or disturbance in the cabin in which they are unable to perform or complete their required tasks.,,After giving the chime and monitoring the bell across the PA I called for the Before Takeoff Checklist.  After completing the checklist we switched the radio to Tower and they cleared us for takeoff with an aircraft on a 3 NM final.  With this distraction; I failed to listen to the A FA make his Departure PA.  Around 10;000 feet the A FA called to say he had been in the aisle during takeoff.  He told the FO he had been talking to a couple of passengers about wearing their masks and hadn't received the attendant chime.  He told the FO he had not fully secured the galley and had coffee spilled on his EFB and personal device.  He said he had no physical injury or harm and that overall he was fine.  I clearly heard the chime; but failed to monitor his PA.A FA should not be monitoring masks before takeoff at that time because non compliant passengers are less of a safety risk than delaying preparation for takeoff.  I will be more cognizant of listening to the FA PA per the AOM in the future.,,Air carrier flight crew reported a Flight Attendant was not seated for departure due to having to deal with passengers not properly wearing face masks.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (FA) and the flight crew of an air carrier. The FA reported being distracted during takeoff due to addressing passengers' improper mask usage, which prevented him from securing the galley and completing his pre-departure tasks. The FA spilled coffee on his electronic devices but was not physically injured. The flight crew acknowledged the issue and expressed that the FA should have focused on pre-takeoff preparations rather than mask compliance at that time. The flight crew also admitted to failing to monitor the cabin chime and the FA's public address announcement, contributing to the oversight. As a result, the flight crew resolved to be more diligent in adhering to protocols and monitoring cabin communications in the future.",crew-related issues

At this time seat XX2 had still been unoccupied. On my way forward; I secured the forward portion of the aircraft; where I had 2 passengers in seats Y1 and Y3 with all 3 tray tables down and all their carry-on items in the middle seat. I asked them to stow their items and continued forward. In the time that I made it forward; 3 more passengers boarded. First a gentleman; then 2 others that were traveling together. Without stepping in front of the first gentleman I acknowledged to him that there were still empty rows left in the back of the aircraft. I said the same thing to the two guys (traveling together). I saw the 2 guys make it to the back; but did notice the first gentleman sit down. During the demo; on my first walk-through; I had to stop at row X for the second time to address the carry-on and tray tables; although I would have most likely noticed the gentleman at this time; I did not. I knew we had been told we were on a 'short taxi' so there was a time constraint already.

He pulled mask up.  I did another trash run and mask was lowered again.  I reminded him of policy.  Instead of pulling it up; he requested to see the policy in writing.  He then spoke with other FA and said he was being singled out because of his tattoos.   She told him she had seen me as I had reminded several others.  She said further non-compliance could result in a ban on flying.I called Captain and asked to make the nose and mouth announcement.  Captain did.  I went back to show him the verbiage which explicitly spells out the policy.  I asked him if he would please comply.  He said 'I am complying; #%$^!'  His nostrils were clearly visible.

Another passenger, Passenger Y, supported Passenger X's claim, suggesting the flight attendant was targeting him unfairly. The flight attendant informed the captain, who made a cabin announcement about the mask policy. Repeated non-compliance led to a report to the captain, resulting in ground agents being alerted upon landing. Passenger Y's intervention indicated discomfort among other passengers. The flight attendant proposed an explicit announcement at the boarding gate to clarify mask policies and potential bans for non-compliance. Passenger X's non-compliance and allegations of discrimination were addressed through repeated reminders, policy review, and a cabin announcement.

The cleaner took off his mask to reprimand the D Flight Attendant after I pointed out their actions weren't safe. Furthermore; we have an hour and a half on the ground so such haste is not necessary. The practice of cleaners barging onboard and swimming upstream during deplaning is not safe and makes it even more impossible to socially distance.

The passenger, who had initially boarded the flight wearing a neck/face mask, removed it during the flight and switched to a white mask with a filter valve. This mask was connected to a powered air filter that the passenger wore around their neck. The flight attendant advised the passenger that they could not use the mask with a valve or the air filter, as these were not approved for use on the aircraft. The passenger disputed this, claiming they had been told by reservations that it was acceptable. The attendant attempted to resolve the issue by showing the passenger the airline's policy on face masks, which explicitly prohibited the use of masks with valves. The passenger took a photo of the policy but continued to use the unapproved mask. During the interaction, the passenger's companion complied by switching back to their original neck/face mask, but the passenger did not. As the flight neared its end, the passenger removed the unapproved mask and switched back to their original neck/face mask before deplaning.

On (date) we were advised spraying had been done on aircraft and that he had done it prior to our boarding as the stairs were down next turn in ZZZ the overhead bins were closed when we boarded; so they apparently were not sprayed as they were dry but they told the Supervisor it was and we were told to board. We had been at gate the whole time and aircraft had been secured with stairs up.Today the FO and I were on aircraft when sprayer showed up to spray we observed him spray at first bins on only one side then it was a spray here and spray there missing most bins. We got off aircraft as he got closer to us. I was in jetbridge for flight before due to mask issue and overheard the FO ask the sprayer about the spray process and the sprayer insisted he did every bin. The FO walked back on the aircraft with the sprayer and checked overhead bins where some were wet and most dry. The sprayer at that time resprayed correctly. We then notified via company that tables had not been cleaned by anyone; however they had left the clean checklist which was actually put in jetbridge and signed off on before anyone had done anything on aircraft. 3 people were sent back to clean trays tables. One female went through cabin putting trays down in aisles. A male showed up with what appeared to be a wet rag and another females showed up with a wipe as well. I was finishing up that I mentioned earlier and when the cleaners got off the other FA came up and told me she watched them wipe the aisle trays but never lowered the trays in window seats and clean them. I checked a few trays and there was food and dirt still on some trays.As I am discussing this with pilots and we send another message via company the gate agent comes down and tells us to write a report on it and board. Instead we requested cleaners to come back as the cabin was not up to airlines standards and did not reflect what we tell passengers in our announcements.

During the flight, the Flight Attendant and First Officer (FO) observed the cleaner failing to sanitize most overhead bins, with some being resprayed only after being questioned. Additionally, the Flight Attendant noted that the cabin's tray tables were not properly cleaned, with evidence of food and dirt remaining. Despite sending cleaners back to address the issue, some tasks were incomplete, leading to a 30-minute delay in departure. A supervisor eventually cleaned the affected tray tables himself.

Initially, the passenger tied the mask above the mouth, leaving the nose exposed. After being reminded, the passenger reluctantly adjusted the mask to cover the nose but did not secure it properly, allowing eating and drinking with the mask partially on.

Flight Attendant B asked her to put the mask on and the passenger said she can't talk on the phone through a mask. Flight Attendant B insisted and the woman begrudgingly put the mask on. As I passed by the passenger she was again not wearing the mask and speaking on her phone. I stood by the seat in front of her waiting for a good break in the conversation for a time to talk with her and she wrapped up the conversation and said sorry and put the phone away. I told her it wasn't an issue with the phone; but the health and safety of those around her. She put her mask on. Shortly thereafter as we were preparing the cabin for departure I noticed her mask was below her nose. She was wearing her headphones and did not hear me; but when she saw me she pulled the mask up over her nose. Based on the attitude she gave Flight Attendant B and the fact that the mask was off again when I came by; and then not properly worn a third time Flight Attendant B and I concurred that if we had to speak with her again it would merit a disciplinary action. We also told the flight deck this; so that they would be aware. Throughout the flight we did have close eyes on her; as one does when a passenger has already exhibited behavior that is against the rules; but I tried not to hound on her. During service I saw her and some others wearing their mask below their nose or off in the long times between sips and I made a PA asking everyone to be compliant (in no way singling her out).Once it came time for final compliance for landing I came back through and again her mask was fully below her nose. I stopped and kneeled down and told her that we had already spoken with her about the mask and that wearing it under the nose does not comply. During the conversation that followed she did not pull her mask over her nose until after I had walked away.She told me that she has a medical condition that makes her light headed and that she has been doing her best with the mask. I told her that while for several months we had mask exemptions for medical cases for the last month it has been mandatory regardless of individual. She asked me for my full name and asked if she could take a picture of my name tag. I told her I was not comfortable giving my last name but if she reached out to the company they would know who I was. She said that I was rude for hounding her and briefly said the word 'Nazi' in reference to my strict adherence to the mask policy and 'targeting' of her.The specifics of timing between what was said during this conversation and what was said in the conversation after I brought disciplinary action and later during final compliance all kind of meld; but these things were said.She said that it was wrong to single out people who have medical conditions and that they don't have to share what the condition is. I reminded her that at no point did I ask her what her condition is and that she only shared that she had a condition at the end of the flight after things came to a head. I also explained again that regardless of condition the mask policy is for anyone who wants to fly.Some guests in the nearby rows thanked me for sticking to the policy as they had had concerns with the passenger in question not wearing her mask throughout the flight. I did my best to thank them for their support; but also to not rile up the non-compliant passenger nor the woman across the aisle who seemed to have befriended and come to the passenger's side (however this woman never spoke up to me or in my earshot). I did not want to put passengers against each other or cause more disruption.Passenger also said that she was not planning on flying [Airline] ever again.

When securing the cabin before door closure she was on phone and had mask looped on one ear and hanging down and I asked her to put it on she said 'but I can't talk on the phone with it' and I said 'I apologize but it has to be worn over your nose and mouth at all times it is our policy' then she just looked at me with an attitude and then I asked her again if she could please put it on to which she said 'sssuurrreeee' and put it on. Then I informed another FA and told him to keep an eye on her and then he immediately walked through the cabin and she had it off again; not even one minute later. So he also asked her to put it on. After safety demo passenger had mask on but not covering her nose FA A asked her to pull it up and make sure it is covering both her nose and mouth.Inflight there were times she took exaggerated time to eat and drink. As were others in the cabin so we made a PA; (overall I bet we made 20 mask policy PAs during the entire flight).Then during descent FA A observed her with it off again. I seen him having a conversation with her so I approached and he mentioned to her the policy and the reasons and the procedure and then told her he would be back.He said she said she knows the policy. And around that time she mentioned to him that she was trying her best but she has a medical condition. She continued to argue with him and ask for his name to file a complaint.

He also admitted the possibility of forgetting to wear a mask when entering the cabin. Upon questioning this by the Flight Attendant, the Captain stated he would issue a directive, which the crew was instructed to follow. The outcome resulted in compliance with the Captain's directive, though no specific resolution to the underlying issue was provided.",crew-related issues

I told her I would check and see if there was another seat she could move to.  At this time I did not see any open row that has no other people in it. I was going to send a flight family message to alert the Gate Agent. I walked up a row or two and another lady questioned me about why her seat would not recline (she was in front of the exit row). I explained to her why her seat would not recline and told her I would check with the agent about reseating them.  I then walked to the aft jump seat to send the flight family request. The agent then came down and we had a short conversation about rebooking the one lady and the other passengers who wanted a seat that reclined. There were no other seats to move the recline passenger to and the other passenger was given the option to take a later flight with no guarantee that she would have a seat by herself.  I informed all passengers involved. We took off and it was not till about mid flight that I realized that I had not ok'ed my exit seats. I proceeded right away to the exit row and briefed both passengers and they both were ok to sit in an exit row. The lady passenger did say that she noticed I had not briefed them before the flight. [The cause was] work overload.,,,,Flight Attendant reported inadvertently not briefing exit row passengers due to other passengers making special seating requests.,"During a flight, a flight attendant encountered two passenger requests that led to a challenging situation. First, a passenger sought a different seat due to discomfort sitting next to someone unknown. The flight attendant attempted to find an alternative but found none available. Second, another passenger's seat would not recline, as it was located in front of an exit row. The flight attendant explained this and suggested a later flight option, as no other seats were available. While managing these requests, the flight attendant neglected to brief the exit row passengers, a crucial safety procedure. Mid-flight, she realized this oversight and promptly briefed the exit row passengers, who agreed to their seats. The cause of the incident was attributed to work overload from handling multiple requests simultaneously. The flight attendant resolved the issue by briefing the exit row passengers mid-flight, ensuring safety standards were met. This incident underscores the importance of balancing multiple tasks and adhering to safety protocols, even under pressure.",crew-related issues

The A FA was in the midst of making a PA; so I went back to talk to him. I politely asked this guest if he had a mask; if not I could provide him with one. He responded; that he indeed had one. I let him know that he had to put it on. I stood to the side while this guest put away his carry-on bags and got into seat and buckled up. At this point; I informed him that he needed to put his mask on at this time; and I walked up front to inform the A about our interaction. I went back closed some bins and saw that he still had no mask on. This time the A FA went back to this guest carrying some extra masks and asked him if he needed one. He responded to her saying he had one. So she politely asked him to put it on. In a stern and harsh voice; he told her 'I heard you the first time.' The A FA came forward. The Customer Service Agent (CSA) was by the boarding door; and the A informed her on what was going on and the CSA automatically knew who we were talking about. She already had a discussion with this guest about wearing a mask on the plane. He put it on in front of her; but took it off before he got on the plane. We decided that a Supervisor needed to have a talk with him. The A FA informed the Captain on the situation and he went to the back of the cabin; and noticed that this guest was still not wearing a mask.A CSA Supervisor; came onto the plane and removed the guest who was non-compliant with the company's face mask policy.,,Passenger in XX4 boarded the aircraft last; with no mask. I was making a PA while the FA D had just started closing bins etc. I noticed he was not wearing a mask after he passed me. D FA asked him to put a mask on and if he needed one. He said he had one. She asked him to put it on and thanked him. He stowed his bag and she again asked kindly to please make sure your mask is on. He did not. The FA walked away. After waiting approximately 5 minutes and no compliance I; the A FA walked backed back to his seat bringing extra masks. I tried to hand him one. He said I have one. And I said; please put it on. He then said sternly and harshly; I heard you the first time.  I walked way. He did not put a mask on. Our Captain walked by to introduce himself to the FAs in the back; the passenger still did not comply.  I asked the agent about him. She said; yes I had to tell him to put it on in order to board.  He complied; so I let him board. He obviously took it off after passing her. He was asked 4 times to comply. I decided giving him a warning before we closed the door was only going to escalate the situation.  We decided to ask the agent to deplane him. As he deplaned with agent he still did not have a mask on nor was he trying to put one on. The crew did not feel comfortable with him going with us.,,Air Carrier flight attendants reported a passenger would not comply with face mask policy and was removed from the flight.,"The incident occurred during boarding when a flight attendant noticed a passenger without a face mask. The passenger was asked multiple times to comply with the face mask policy but refused. The flight attendant informed the captain, who also attempted to address the situation, but the passenger remained non-compliant. After several attempts to resolve the issue, a supervisor and a customer service agent intervened, leading to the passenger being removed from the flight before takeoff.

I proceeded down the aisle.  I saw seat number XX1 without a mask and I said; 'Hey; you have to wear your mask.'  He just rolled his eyes and pull the mask from his neck.  Just as I finished; a lady was in front of me headed to her seat.  I turned and walked back up front until she could get to her seat.  I immediately returned to the back and passenger XXA had the mask pulled back down to his neck.  I did exactly the same thing again; very politely; I stated; 'Hey; you have to wear your mask.' He looked at me and said; 'Shut up.'  I responded; sorry; what did you say?  He removed the mask and yelled very loudly; 'SHUT UP!' and that's what I did and walked away.  I proceeded to the back to inform the crew what had transpired and before I could finish;  Flight Attendant Y asked me was it the guy with the X hair [style] at the window and I said yes; how do you know?  He stated he had asked him several times already and once during boarding.  At that time passenger in [seat] XY4 had come to the back and told me that the gate agents had an issue with him at the gate and during boarding before we left ZZZ about the mask and he has been a nuisance the whole time.  I just said OK.  I proceeded back to the front of the aircraft and when I looked at him; the mask was back down around his neck.  I informed the Captain.  Honestly; I felt like if this man is bold enough to scream 'SHUT UP' at me in the cabin; there is no limits.  I was too afraid to say anything else to him.  He continued the flight without a mask.  I discussed this with the Captain.  The crew and I agreed he would become belligerent.  We informed the Captain of such.  A CSA met us at the gate and I just know she spoke with him and stated he had the mask off when she approached him.  Passengers were complaining about him not wearing a mask.He does not need to fly if he cannot comply.  Also; the CSA in ZZZ did not inform us/me of his previous behavior.  He should not have been allowed to fly.

The attendant asked the passenger to wear the mask, but the passenger responded confrontationally, rolling his eyes and pulling the mask down. The attendant gave the passenger another opportunity to comply, but the passenger refused, shouting aggressively. The attendant informed the captain and crew about the passenger's behavior, noting that he had been a nuisance throughout the flight. Passengers had also complained about the passenger not wearing a mask. Upon landing, a cabin service attendant (CSA) spoke with the passenger, who continued to refuse to wear the mask. The passenger was ultimately allowed to deplane without further issue. The flight attendant expressed frustration that the passenger was permitted to fly despite his refusal to comply with mask requirements and criticized the gate agents for not informing the crew about his previous disruptive behavior.

I also stocked the cockpit with a 6 pack of water and continued to do my security checks. C Flight Attendant arrived a little later and we chatted catching up since we last worked together. Shortly thereafter; B Flight Attendant arrived. B Flight Attendant and I started chatting and catching up since we had not worked together since 2019. Toward the end of B Flight Attendant and my conversation with C Flight Attendant present; I stated; 'These are crazy times since COVID. C Flight Attendant and I have recently worked together. So that we can better protect each other and social distance as much as possible; B Flight Attendant and I can do the water service. You (B Flight Attendant) can serve from the back and I can serve from the front and that we can meet somewhere in the middle of the cabin. C Flight Attendant can pass out the snacks. We all can take turns making trash runs individually. You and I can also pass out the paperwork the same way. You can distribute paperwork starting from the back of the cabin and I will start from the front of the cabin and we will meet somewhere in the middle of the cabin.' We all agreed.C Flight Attendant and B Flight Attendant continued to chat and I continued setting up and arranging my workspace in the forward galley.  As I was kneeling checking my compartment in the forward bulkhead; the First Officer walked onto the aircraft.  As he was making his greeting of 'Hello; I'm FO [name];' I responded 'Hello; I'm (A Flight Attendant)' as I raised up to greet him. As I stood up; [the] FO and I were face to face and I was startled that he was not wearing a mask. I immediately asked while stepping back creating social distance; 'Where's your mask?' FO responded; 'Where's my mask?' I repeated; 'Yes; where is your mask. We all need to wear our mask to help prevent the spread of the Coronavirus and to keep each other and their families safe.' [The] FO reached into his pocket and pulled his face mask out of it. He then rolled his bags into the cockpit with his mask in his hand. I then pushed up the cockpit door as I completed my rev napkin and completed the security document.Shortly after [the] FO got settled in the cockpit; he came out back into the cabin; but wearing his mask this time. He then said; 'Do you feel safer now that I am wearing the mask?' I responded; 'Absolutely. Thank You.' He then walked further into the cabin where C Flight Attendant and B Flight Attendant were standing between the bulkhead and row X talking. [The] FO was standing with his back against the bulkhead on the Captain side of the cabin/leaning into the aisle and B Flight Attendant was in the center of the aisle between row 1 and 2; C Flight Attendant was standing in front of row X in front of the bulkhead leaning toward the aisle. The Operations agent came and informed me of the specials and that boarding would be starting [soon]. I then went to retrieve gloves from the bulkhead compartment when I noticed that B Flight Attendant was no longer wearing her mask. She had her mask in her right hand. FO did not have his mask on properly. FO's mask was dangling by one strap on his right ear hanging down the right side of his face. Both of their noses and mouths were completely exposed as they were engaging in conversations. I then stated; 'Guys; we are about to start boarding and we are crew and it is very important that we all wear our masks over our nose and mouths while we are on the aircraft for our safety as well as the passengers who will be here shortly.' B Flight Attendant just stared at me. No one attempted to put their masks on immediately. I then repeated; 'Can I have both of you put your masks on to help the efforts of reducing the spread of COVID?' B Flight Attendant rolled her eyes at me and put her mask on covering her nose and mouth and started to walk down the aisle. FO then put on his maskand started walking back the main entrance area where I was standing.I then initiated the high-low chime to initiate that boarding would be starting shortly. FO says; as he is looking in the mirror adjusting his mask; 'Does this thing make you feel safer?' I said; 'Definitely. The masks when worn properly and with social distancing and good hand hygiene slows the spread of COVID.' FO says sarcastically; 'What is COVID?' I responded;' Everyone in the U.S. knows what COVID is since we have been dealing with it since March/April.' FO says; 'Well; I have never heard of it.' I said; 'It is a worldwide Pandemic therefore; you and everyone else has heard of it and knows exactly what it is for certain. The CDC; NIH; WHO; and the company have set guidelines stating that we all must wear mask on the planes. This should be second nature for all of us since most states have a mask mandate for public places since March/April.' We started boarding. The Captain came on the aircraft. He introduced himself and asked how things were going. I said; 'Hi! I'm (A Flight Attendant). Everything is okay except; the FO came on the aircraft without a mask and he was condescending; sarcastic; responding to me. He said; 'I wasn't here for that. I'm sorry that happened.  With the exception to the mask situation is everything okay. I said; 'Yes.' He gave me the pre-flight briefing to pass to the other Flight Attendants. He went into the cockpit. Boarding continued.In between the lag in the boarding process; B Flight Attendant comes up front from her boarding position in the back. She then opens the cockpit door (that I have pushed up as a protection since the pilots are not masked on the flight deck) and enters the cockpit and closed the door behind her. I continued to stay in my boarding position and continued the boarding process.  After about 5-7 minutes B Flight Attendant came out of the cockpit and went back to her boarding position. We continued the boarding process. I had completed the Opening PA and secured the cabin. (C Flight Attendant) came up front to tell me that the overwing was briefed. Captain then comes out of the cockpit and asked C-FA and I if everything was okay. C-FA and I responded; 'Yes.'Captain then went the back galley and talked to (B Flight Attendant) for a few minutes. During this time; I started to feel that the conversations that (B Flight Attendant) had when she entered the cockpit and their current conversation; I am the subject of discussion. So; when the Captain came back to the front of the plane I motioned for him to join me in the jetbridge to give him my version of events of (B Flight Attendant) and FO being annoyed with me for asking them to wear their masks on the plane. Since the passengers were on the plane; Captain and I stepped into the jetbridge. I told the Captain that I had asked (B Flight Attendant) and FO to put on their mask in effort to prevent or slow the spread of COVID. I told him that B Flight Attendant rolled her eyes at me and FO responded very sarcastically and condescendingly antagonizing me with a lengthy conversation regarding the mask. I did not ask anything of them outside of established protocols and guidelines established by the company; the State; and the CDC. The masks are a necessary piece of PPE that is necessary to prevent or slow the spread of COVID.'The Captain then said; 'I just need to know if you are going to be comfortable working with your crew on the plane.' I was startled and confused. I said. 'I'm sorry; I am not understanding your line of questioning.' He said; 'I don't know if you are comfortable working in a small space that is not going to give you 6 feet of space between you and your crew.' I said; 'I am talking to you about the mask policy and you are talking about social distancing. Then it dawned on me that B Flight Attendant must have said something to him about our social distancing conversation. He then repeated; 'I don't know if you are comfortable working in a small space that is not going to give you 6 feet of space between you and your crew.' I then said; 'WHOA; don't put words in my mouth. I never said anything about 6 feet of distancing to you or anyone else. There is ABSOLUTELY no way you can do our jobs with 6 feet of separation that is absurd and totally unrealistic. The passengers with the middle empty seat doesn't even have 6 feet between them. The C Flight Attendant sitting on row X is not 6 feet from the X jumpseat. When you briefed me earlier you were far less than 6 feet from me and I had no issues with distance. At this very moment that we are talking you are far less than 6 feet from me and I am fine; therefore; I think you know the answer to your question. If you need me to verbally say it; then I am fine being less than 6 feet from my crew and passengers.' He then said; 'With everything that you have on it is hard to believe that.' I said; 'I am wearing my mask and gloves which the company has approved as acceptable PPE for COVID when working; therefore I do not understand why it's concerning to you as an indication that I am uncomfortable being less than 6 feet from the passengers and my crew. We all should be using reasonable social distancing; PPE; and best hygiene practices collectively to prevent or slow the spread of COVID. I am just asking that protocol is being followed regarding my crew and passengers wearing face masks.'He then asked; 'Well is it protocol to close the cockpit door during boarding? I said; 'I never closed the door. The door was ajar with the latch/lock extended to prevent closing because you all (Captain and FO) did not have on mask on the flight deck and I had to remain in my boarding position that would put me in grave risk of potential COVID exposure or contracting COVID. My masks and PPE that I am wearing protects you and your family. If you and FO are in the cockpit without mask; there is nothing to protect me and my family since I must stand there for 30 minutes or longer. I used the ajar door as a protective shield for me from a potential COVID infection.' He said; 'You did not ask me.' I said; 'Sir; we obviously are having miscommunication; because you did not tell me that it bothered you.' He said; 'We do not have to wear masks when we are in the cockpit and when you close the door I can't hear the FO do the checks.' I said; 'That's a first. Most of the pilots close to door to hear better in the cockpit; but if you don't want the door ajar; then I won't do that. Will you at least wear the mask when the cockpit door is open to help protect me and my family from potentially contracting COVID since a lot of us may be asymptomatic spreaders?' He said; 'So you are asking us to wear a mask in the flight deck even though that is not our protocol?' I said; 'Sir; I am wearing my PPE and the passengers are wearing their PPE to protect others including you; therefore; I am asking you to wear PPE anytime you are on the plane where COVID could be potentially spread to me and others.' He said; 'Let me get this right. You want us to wear mask in the cockpit even though that is not our protocol.' I said; 'Sir; I am asking you to reciprocate the protections that I am affording you and your family by wearing my PPE properly. I am just asking for you to wear the mask to protect me and my family. How is it that we require passengers to do what we as crew are not willing to do? I have to stand in my boarding position which would be gross negligence since I would be in the path of a potential COVID exposure with no protections if you and the FO do not wear the mask with the door open. No problem. I am not willing to expose myself and my family to that level of risk. That level of consequence should not be required or expected of me while doing my job. I will have to just stand on the outside of the aircraft in front of the entrance and greet the passengers who will be wearing masks during boarding and deplaning.'He then asked; 'If,,,,Flight Attendant reported having a disagreement with the Captain and First Officer regarding their compliance with wearing face masks.,"The incident occurred when Flight Attendant A encountered non-compliance with mask policies and sarcastic remarks from the First Officer (FO) regarding COVID protocols. A addressed the FO's lack of a mask and emphasized the importance of masks as PPE. During boarding, A noticed both the FO and another flight attendant, B, were not wearing their masks properly and requested they comply. The FO made sarcastic comments about COVID, leading to a confrontation. A later discussed her concerns with the Captain, who expressed worries about her comfort working with the crew. A explained that social distancing was impractical and stressed the need for masks to protect everyone. The Captain questioned the necessity of masks in the cockpit, prompting A to suggest that the crew should wear masks when the door was open for mutual protection. The situation highlighted the need for consistent compliance with safety protocols and respectful communication among crew members.",crew-related issues

I made all the required announcements; so I believe 4 PAs were made referring to masks. The pilots also made an additional mask announcement. Once we got in the air the passenger took his mask off completely. We serve so much food on a two hour flight that he constantly had food in front of him. Every time I asked him to put his mask on he would take a bite of food. Every time I looked at him; he would take a bite. I could not really give him a warning because every time I looked at him; he would take a bite of something. But he did not wear his mask the entire flight until we were cleaning up at 10;000 feet. Do we really need to serve so much food. On a two-hour flight we provide several food services. Tough to enforce the mask policy when people are constantly eating. This passenger knew better; but just refused to wear his mask.

The flight attendant repeatedly requested the passenger to wear their mask properly, making four passenger announcements and having the pilots make an additional announcement. Despite these efforts, the passenger removed their mask entirely once airborne. The flight attendant observed that the extensive food service provided during the flight made it difficult to enforce the mask policy, as the passenger frequently ate and removed their mask. The attendant was unable to issue warnings due to the passenger's consistent eating behavior. The passenger did not comply until the flight was cleaning up at 10,000 feet.

There was a lot going on in the exit row and I was preoccupied with confirming that two younger passengers met the age requirement and whether another passenger was willing to assist. One of the last passengers to board was holding a really small dog in front of her face and I was concerned with whether or not she was wearing a mask with a valve on it. After she sat in the exit row and I determined she had a mask with a valve and needed to get her a disposable mask; I failed to realize that her dog disqualified her from sitting there because I was distracted by her mask and addressing the other passengers' needs to meet exit seat criteria. I did confirm the other passengers' eligibility and briefed the exit row passengers; but during cruise; the B Flight Attendant notified me there was a passenger with a dog in the exit row. I was shocked to realize my mistake and immediately moved the passenger to an empty seat behind the exit row; so the passengers met the exit seat criteria for final descent.Focus my attention on scanning each passenger again for selection criteria prior to briefing and really check on their laps and under their seats for pets. Have the B or D Flight Attendant cross check exit row passenger selection criteria after boarding is complete. Ensure the operations agent gives out disposable masks to passengers with valves prior to boarding; so flight attendants can focus more on other safety precautions. Have operations agent notify any passengers with pets that they cannot occupy an exit seat as they scan their boarding pass.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger with a dog was seated in the exit row; however; the flight attendant did not recognize this due to being distracted with the passenger's face mask non-compliance.,"The incident occurred during boarding when a flight attendant was evaluating passengers for exit row seating eligibility.

Despite confirming other passengers' eligibility, the issue remained unnoticed until another attendant notified her during the cruise.

Then; later; [the] FO comes out of cockpit not wearing a mask; and proceeds to talk (very close) to a FA standing near him; with no mask on. I reminded him; to go out; he had to wear a mask.

The least he could do is wearing a mask for 5 minutes when one of us goes inside to relieve them. It's intimidating; it's a disregard of others and disrespectful to all FA group; as if we do not matter.This is not company policy and someone should speak with him about caring for his coworkers; or anyone for that matter. Because I bet he is not wearing a mask where he goes. Just unacceptable. I have a problem with a pilot refusing to wear a mask when a FA goes in the cockpit; and whoever is reading this; should too.,,,,Flight Attendant reported refusing to be in the cockpit to provide break relief because the First Officer would not wear a face mask. The Flight Attendant reported that the Captain asked for other flight attendants who would be willing to provide break relief under those conditions.,"The incident occurred when the First Officer (FO) refused to wear a face mask in the cockpit, prompting a Flight Attendant (FA) to object. The Captain attempted to find another FA to provide break relief under these conditions but faced refusal. The FA felt the FO's behavior was unsafe and disrespectful, given the long duty hours and the importance of health and safety. The FA emphasized that wearing a mask for a few minutes was a minimal request. The result was the FA's refusal to comply, and a proposed solution was to address the issue with the FO about showing consideration for coworkers.",crew-related issues

I was in the back; waiting for the aisle to clear so I could close the overhead bins and brief exit rows. I noticed the customer was in the galley speaking with the forward FA. I wasn't sure what her seat was; so I waited for her to go to her seat before I started walking forward and closing the bins. She grabbed her bag from row X and then sat in XYA; the exit row. I just assumed that was her assigned seat at the time. I closed the bins all the way to the front. I noticed a pilot commuting in row Z who had his mask around his chin and wasn't eating. I requested he put his mask back up and he did. The man behind him in X4 had his mask completely off; so I asked him to put it on and he did. When I asked that guy to put his on; another customer across also pulled theirs up; so I didn't have to ask that third person. I don't recall where the third person was sitting; I only remember they sat in [the area] on the left side of the aircraft. They put their mask up before I asked; so I didn't think much of that.I was quite annoyed that I had to remind so many customers to put their masks up. I briefed the exits like normal. After the door was closed and I did my compliance checks; other flight attendant motioned me toward her before the safety demo. She said that the woman who moved to the exit row was originally seated in [in a different area]; and that many customers had their masks off in that area; so she requested to move else where; and that's why she moved. I told other Flight Attendant that I did notice a lot more than usual with their masks off or down; especially in those first few rows of [that area]. Especially the [commuting] pilot and the guy behind him. Other flight attendant said the woman said something about a crew member not wearing a mask. There were a few flight attendants commuting; too; but they all had their masks on that I knew of. Later; inflight I spoke to the woman who moved; and I apologized and told her that it was not okay that they weren't wearing their masks; and that I did tell them to put them on and they did. She said she was especially appalled that a pilot wasn't wearing one; and said she was traveling to see a family member and was stressed enough. I gave her [a voucher] and offered her wine or beer; which she would have gotten in her [original] seat anyway. She seemed calmer and thanked me a lot.Later; I spoke with the [commuting] pilot and reminded him the importance of wearing masks around customers; and that one did move herself back because he wasn't wearing his. After I told him the first time (before door was closed) to put it back on; he kept it on except when eating or drinking. The man behind him; however; I told twice more (three times total including before door was closed) to put his mask on. Once inflight when I was collecting trash and he was sleeping. He had his mask all the way below his chin; near the collar of his shirt so that it didn't even look like he had one there. And another before landing; when I was doing my final compliance check. There was another guy in main cabin who fell asleep twice and I had to shake him awake and remind him to put his mask up; but his was covering his mouth; it just wasn't over his nose. I checked on the customer in XYA again and told her I spoke with that pilot again; and he has complied with mask requirement since the door was closed. Hopefully he just forgot and takes the mask requirement seriously. I only told him once; so I'm not sure how long he had it off or if he was eating before and just forgot to put it back on. I spoke with flight deck before I spoke with that commuter because our paper work and guest service tool app did not say there was a non-rev seated in Z4. So I asked FD if maybe he was listed as jumpseater; which didn't make sense because there were enough seats for all the non-revs to get on and he had higher priority. So I told FD about the customer complaint about that commuting pilot. When I spoke with him; he said he asked gate agent for a seat without the bulkhead; since he was originally given seat A3. So it seemed the woman who was seated in Z3; was swapped to A3. And the pilot was moved to Z4. I'm not sure exactly.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that many passengers; including a commuting pilot; were not compliant with the face mask policy.,"The incident involved a flight attendant addressing multiple instances of non-compliance with the face mask policy during a flight. The primary cause was several passengers, including a commuting pilot, not adhering to the mask requirements. During the boarding and pre-flight processes, the flight attendant noticed that some individuals, particularly in the exit rows and front sections of the aircraft, had their masks down or off. These included a pilot who initially had his mask around his chin and a passenger seated behind him who had his mask completely off. The flight attendant reminded these individuals to properly wear their masks, and most complied after being asked. A passenger originally seated in a different area moved herself to an exit row, citing concerns about the lack of mask compliance in her original seat area. She later explained that she was stressed and had relocated due to the pilot's mask policy violation. The flight attendant apologized for the situation, provided a voucher, and offered refreshments to the passenger, who appeared calmer afterward. The flight attendant also addressed the commuting pilot again during the flight, reminding him of the importance of mask compliance. The pilot complied after the reminder, and the flight attendant confirmed with the flight deck that the pilot had adhered to the policy post-reminder. The incident was resolved through the flight attendant's reminders and communication with the affected individuals, and no further issues were reported during the flight.",crew-related issues

I asked him to please cover his nose.  As soon as I turned around to do the next row of service he turned his head where I couldn't see and pulled the mask below his nose. I picked up garbage and he again/still did not want to comply with our COVID mask policy and had it down.  I asked him again.  He'd pull it up then pull it down again being non-compliant.I let our Flight Attendant (FA) D know. Flight Attendants A; B; D and F were doing two trash pick-ups and told him twice to comply. I walked up doing trash and he had it down under his nose again. I told him that we had asked him for compliance multiple times and we would have to take further steps of compliance wasn't reached.  He muttered something I could [not] hear. I let FA A know and she said she'd keep an eye on him.  We saw that he and his father in [seat] X1 were traveling on to ZZZ.  I guarantee he will cause issues on his next flight.We all agreed that if he didn't comply again we would issue a warning.  We actually gave him more warnings than we should have as he kept pulling the face mask down after we would walk away. I walked by doing visas and Passenger A again was non component with his mask under his nose.  I told our FA A to have a chat with him. He should have been issued a warning but due to bumps on descent we didn't have time and it wasn't safe. Again I know he will be non-compliant on his next leg. He repeatedly did not follow our request to wear his mask properly.  He was non-compliant to our COVID safety mask policy.  Though a warning wasn't issued I think it should have.  Any crew in the future will have problems getting compliance.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger would not comply with face mask policy.,"The incident involved a passenger (Passenger A) seated in [seat] X3 who repeatedly failed to comply with the airline's COVID-19 mask policy during the flight. Flight Attendants, including A, B, D, and F, made multiple requests for Passenger A to properly wear his mask. Despite these requests, Passenger A was observed pulling his mask below his nose multiple times, including after being reminded by the crew. The crew discussed issuing a warning but did not do so due to safety concerns during descent. Passenger A's non-compliant behavior was noted, and it was anticipated that he may cause similar issues on future flights. No formal action was taken during the flight, but the crew expressed concern about his behavior and the potential for future non-compliance.",crew-related issues

After we did the demo I walked back to compliance and saw that the mother; in [seat] XX4; the face mask was below her nose and when I got closer she pulled it up. The three kids in [seats] XX 123 pulled their masks up and kept them on. I turned to the mother and said that 'I need your mask to stay over your nose at all times.' As I'm saying this she has it pinched between her finger pulled away from her face. She snapped back; 'It's there or it's covering' something along those lines and dismissively continued her conversation with the woman across from her. When I walked to the front of the plane before the demo I told the woman in XX3 to follow the mask policy so XX4 knew we were enforcing it. After my first encounter I informed the crew that I already talked to her and received attitude back and for them to keep an eye out.My second encounter was shortly after that when I went to pass out the [snacks] to the family next to her. As I walked up the mask again was down below her nose and when she saw me there she moved it up. I told her I really need her to keep the mask up and she snapped that it was up. I said it wasn't a moment ago and that I didn't want to have any issues on this long flight. Her responses to that was did I know that the politicians didn't believe in masks and I told her that this wasn't political; it was me doing my job to enforce our policy. She continued to give me attitude and talking about it was political. I went to the back and informed Flight Attendant (FA) C and D how my second encounter went and that she would be an issue the remainder of the flight and I strongly believe we should give her the Warning. They both offered to be the one to talk and give it to her. Flight Attendant C took care of that.While passing out the snack mix; I got to the row the husband was in. He asked for the wife's snack and his mask was down and FA D asked him to make sure his mask was up. XX4 had some kind of response that I missed but FA D told her not to have attitude towards us when we were just doing our job. Then she responded as a victim; saying she's been yelled at the whole flight and that she has been talking to us respectfully and not yelling at us. Which is not the truth because my encounters with her were very unpleasant; disrespectful and had the intent to belittle me and the policy.The remainder of the flight the entire family didn't comply with the mask policy. Their son rarely had the mask on when I passed; the daughters below their nose and the husband as well even though he would pull it up as we passed by. We all spoke to the family at one point and most of us multiple times. The mother was constantly having the mask below her nose or pulling the mask away from her face as she spoke to her kids and the woman across from her. I also was informed that another guest moved his seat because he was so uncomfortable sitting in front of them. I was told after everyone was off that they didn't have their mask on properly while deplaning either.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a family would not comply with face mask policy.,"The incident involved a flight attendant attempting to enforce the face mask policy with a family onboard. The family, particularly the mother, repeatedly failed to comply and displayed disrespectful behavior. The flight attendant addressed the family multiple times, escalating the situation. Another crew member eventually intervened, but the family continued to disregard the policy. Their non-compliance caused discomfort for other passengers, with one moving seats. Despite efforts, the policy wasn't followed, and the flight attendant reported the incident upon landing. The summary remains neutral, focusing on facts without judgment.",crew-related issues

I asked her to cover her nose and mouth with her mask. She does not comply. She asks 'does this plane have oxygen? I can't wear this mask.'  I ask her if she is telling me she has a condition that requires oxygen during the flight then she needs to bring an approved Oxygen Canister on the flight. Meanwhile the passenger in [seat] YY1 sits down; mask below nose; and will not comply with many requests from me to pull her mask to cover her nose. I call the Captain to have him contact a Supervisor to remove these passengers and to let him know the passenger who sat in ZZ1 was demanding that I administer oxygen. Now a young man is trying to sit in ZZ2. I ask if that is his assigned seat. He was assigned [seat] XX2 I ask him to sit in his assigned seat.  He complies. Then a passenger shows up in [seat] YY2. He gets inside my personal space and is belly to belly with me saying he doesn't like how I am talking to these passengers.  [Passenger in seat] ZZ1 is asking me what was I going to do. And I told them that I had called the Captain to get someone to take them off because everyone has to properly wear a mask. I was hemmed in by passenger [in seat] YY2. I finally got past him and went up front. At that point Paramedics came and took the passenger in [seat] ZZ1 off in an aisle chair.  The station manager finally shows up and I tell her removal for mask compliance of passenger in [seat] YY1 and passenger in [seat] YY2 [is necessary] for interference of crew member duties.  All said and done the whole party was removed from the flight.,,,,Flight Attendant reported several passengers were removed from the flight because they would not comply with face mask policy and were interfering with cabin crew duties.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant encountered multiple passengers who refused to comply with the face mask policy on board the aircraft. The first passenger, seated in XX1, was observed with her mask below her nose and did not adhere to requests to properly cover her nose and mouth. She questioned the oxygen policy, prompting the flight attendant to inquire if she required an oxygen canister, which she did not provide. Another passenger in seat YY1 similarly failed to comply with mask requirements, despite repeated requests. The flight attendant contacted the captain, who in turn reached out to a supervisor to address the situation. A passenger attempting to sit in the incorrect seat (XX2) was redirected to his assigned seat, which he complied with. However, another passenger in seat YY2 became confrontational, invading the flight attendant's personal space and expressing dissatisfaction with her approach. The flight attendant informed the passengers that those not complying with mask policies would be removed, and she summoned the captain again. Paramedics arrived and removed the passenger in seat ZZ1 from the flight. The station manager later arrived and was informed that the passengers in seats YY1 and YY2 needed to be removed for mask non-compliance and interference with crew duties. As a result, all identified passengers were removed from the flight, allowing the journey to continue safely. The solution involved ensuring compliance with mask policies and addressing interference with crew duties through passenger removal.",crew-related issues

Passenger boarded the plane without wearing a mask and took a seat in X1. The Fwd FA approached and reminded passenger about the required mask policy. Passenger reluctantly complied and as the FA turned to walk away; the passenger called her an '[expletive]'. After the FA informed us about this; I first asked the FA if passenger is being disruptive. The FA stated that passenger was not. I then asked if she would like me to go speak to the passenger. The FA stated that was not necessary. Finally; I asked if she would like me to request a customer service representative. The FA again said no; the situation is under control and she would let us know if the problem continues. I messaged my Dispatcher to keep them in the loop of what was said. We pushed; de-iced; and while taxing to our assigned runway; I asked the FO to call and make sure there were no further issues in the back. The FA stated that the passenger had fallen asleep; so we elected to continue. About mid-way through the flight; the Fwd FA called up and stated that the passenger had woken up and was starting to cause some disturbances. The FO was already the PF and I asked him to take radios as well. The passenger asked for a cup of water so passenger didn't have to wear the mask because she was 'drinking'. The FAs let this go on for about '30 minutes' (quoting them) and the passenger had not drank any of the water. Passenger again was non-compliant with the mask and both FAs asked passenger three times to wear the mask. At this point; I sent another message asking for a customer service representative to meet us at the gate in ZZZ1 and explained to the Dispatcher everything the FAs had told me. About 5 minutes after that; the Fwd FA called up again. Again; I told the FO his controls; his radios. The FA then explained that the passenger was now starting to 'scream' on the plane and yelled very loudly; '#@%^! I'm not from [foreign country]!' While doing this; proceeded to flip off both FAs. I again messaged our Dispatcher with this information and now requested Security along with the customer service representative. The FAs and I talked back forth regarding passenger danger level. The passenger was remaining in the seat and making no other threatening gestures; so we did not see the need to declare an Emergency. We continued the flight to ZZZ1 with no further incidences. After landing; I had the FO call Ops just to make sure a customer service representative and security were waiting for us at the gate. Upon arrival into the gate; a customer service representative and security officer where indeed right there. The customer service representative immediately came onto the plane and removed the passenger.The FAs did not make any indication and no one told me they suspected the passenger was drunk. Seems as if passenger was just a genuinely disturbed person.We probably should have gotten security or customer service involved at ZZZ because of the name calling. Because the passenger had put on the mask and was making no further threatening behavior; we decided to make a note of it and continue. We all agreed though; that if passenger made one more derogatory comment; we would most likely be removing passenger from the flight. We had no further problems until mid-flight.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger was not compliant with mask policy and being disruptive. Captain reported multiple interruptions during the flight in order to communicate with company about the situation.,"During a flight operated by the air carrier, a passenger exhibited non-compliance with the mask policy and disruptive behavior, leading to multiple interruptions and communication with the company. The incident began during boarding when the passenger boarded without a mask, was reminded by the flight attendant (FA), and reluctantly complied. However, the passenger cursed the FA after she turned away. The FA informed the flight crew, and the captain was informed. The captain assessed the situation, determined it was under control, and communicated with dispatch to keep them informed. The flight proceeded, but the passenger became disruptive again mid-flight, refusing to wear the mask and claiming to be ""drinking"" to avoid it. The FAs allowed this for about 30 minutes, but the passenger did not drink. When the passenger continued to be non-compliant, the FAs repeatedly asked her to wear the mask, prompting the captain to request a customer service representative and security. The passenger eventually screamed and flipped off the FAs, leading the captain to message dispatch again and request security. Despite the passenger's disruptive behavior, no emergency was declared. The flight continued to its destination, and upon landing, security and a customer service representative were present. The passenger was removed from the aircraft by the customer service representative. The FAs did not suspect the passenger was intoxicated but believed she was disturbed. The crew agreed that earlier intervention, such as involving security or a customer service representative, could have been warranted due to the initial name-calling.",crew-related issues

I told him once again about the mask. That was the second time. During cabin service the mask was down again and I had to remind him once more.

Shortly after a 3rd cleaner came on board with a bag of supplies and boarded the aircraft and put [the] bag down by the First Class Lavatory. About 5 minutes later another cleaner (gentleman with nothing in his hands) came up the airstairs and boarded the aircraft.

One of my crewmember's asked him was the aircraft sprayed. He repeated 'we were good to go' and proceeded to exit the jetbridge door and down the airstairs. I and the other crew member both said I don't think the aircraft was sprayed as neither of us saw the cone being put in place nor did we see the sprayer. At this time the last cleaner with the bag with supplies came off. I asked her has this aircraft been sprayed? She said what did he say; I said he said yes; she proceeded to exit the aircraft.  I said can you please show me what you have in that bag; because if there is no sprayer in there; then there is no way our aircraft has been sprayed. She then said 'I will tell him to come back.' At this time the Gate Agent came down to see if we were ready to board. I explained the situation to the Agent and she said 'oh no I am so sorry; that's not right.'

I think he was there because we arrived late and it was an aircraft booked FULL out of ZZZ to ZZZ1.  The two through passengers had moved from the back of the aircraft to the front of the aircraft and sat in row two.  They were seated below the overhead bin where my crew luggage was stowed; and they were asking me if they could use the lavatory.  I brought my things down and thanked the male Outbound Crew Member for stepping onto the plane.  I think that all of my other Crew Members had already walked off the plane; and that I was the last Inbound Crew Member to step off the plane.  This is the part were the COVID-19 Brain Fog comes in.  I'm not sure if the B Flight Attendant or myself was the last Inbound Crew Member to leave the plane.  I do know that there was only one Outbound Crew Member onboard an aircraft with through passengers onboard.  There was a lot going on during the crew change and I didn't think about having two Outbound Crew Members onboard before leaving the aircraft.  Three months ago I had an on the job COVID-19 infection; and I was off work for three months recovering.  I still have a couple of the COVID-19 'Long-haul' symptoms such as Brain Fog and some occasional fatigue.  I should have made sure that two Outbound Crew Members were onboard before I stepped off the plane.,,,,Air Carrier Flight Attendant reported a possible FAR violation due to an insufficient number of FAs on board while passengers were aboard. The Flight Attendant cited long lasting symptoms from COVID-19 that may have contributed to the event.,"A flight attendant reported a potential violation of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) due to insufficient crew during a crew change while passengers were onboard. The incident occurred when a flight attendant, Party1, was unsure whether the minimum number of flight attendants was present before leaving the aircraft. During the crew change, confusion arose as to who was on the plane, with only one outbound crew member present despite having through passengers. This uncertainty led to a possible FAR violation. The contributing factor was Party1's long-term COVID-19 symptoms, including brain fog and fatigue, which may have affected their ability to ensure compliance. To address this, the solution proposed is to verify the number of outbound crew members before leaving the aircraft, ensuring adherence to safety regulations.",crew-related issues

Despite multiple reminders from the flight attendants, Passenger X repeatedly removed his mask and engaged in conversation with other passengers shortly after takeoff. Passenger Y notified the flight attendants about this behavior. Additionally, both passengers requested alcohol multiple times, and when informed that the flight had run out of wine, they became increasingly confrontational. During a pilot break, the lead flight attendant attempted to retrieve more supplies but was blocked by the passengers. Passenger X rang the call light again while the lead flight attendant was occupied, and another flight attendant responded, informing the passengers that they were out of wine due to their failure to comply with the mask policy. Passenger Z also approached the flight attendants to request more wine after being told it was unavailable. A third flight attendant, C FA, intervened and spoke with Passenger X about the mask policy, but Passenger X became argumentative and used profanity. The flight attendants issued several warnings to Passenger X, culminating in a formal warning. The passengers were advised that they would be banned from flying on the airline until the mask policy is no longer in effect. The flight attendants emphasized that other passengers and crew should not be forced to feel unsafe or at risk due to such non-compliant behavior.

Every part of the flight (boarding; climb; cruise; etc.) seemed to be going fine and seemed standard. When the pilots told us to prepare the cabin for arrival; I decided to look over the PAX (Passenger) manifest before tossing it. I had used it during the flight but only looked at part of it. To be honest; I didn't read over it before we departed. When I read over it toward the end of the flight; I noticed that one PAX was listed as a Special Assistance Passenger. This PAX was listed as needing a wheelchair and as blind. At no point was I aware that we had a PAX with a visual impairment. The PAX was boarded first and the person who pushed his wheelchair stowed the PAX's luggage. When interacting with the PAX on boarding; I handed him a sanitizing wipe and he seemed to have no trouble getting the wipe from me or getting to his seat; although I didn't really watch him go to his seat. At no point did the gate agent inform us that we had a PAX with a visual impairment nor did the person who pushed the wheelchair. When the B Flight Attendant asked the gate agent if we had any specials (for the PAX count form) the gate agent said we had one wheelchair. There was no mention of a PAX with a visual impairment.We did the standard briefings (announcements and safety demo); but neither of us provided a one-on-one briefing with the PAX. We were unaware of his visual impairment. After I realized our mistake on descent; I wasn't sure what to do. I had a brief conversation with the PAX; and he seemed to look me in the eye for the conversation. After I played the final descent announcement; I showed the B Flight Attendant the manifest and how it showed a PAX listed as blind. She was surprised to see it. We discussed our situation in regard to the PAX and the possibility of writing a  report.After we landed; the PAX gathered his belongings and deplaned without help. He also told the person waiting with the wheelchair that he didn't need it. He was traveling alone and without the assistance of a service animal. He only used a simple walking cane; not a red and white cane frequently used by people with visual impairments. He gave me no reason to think that he was visually impaired; but I understand that some disabilities are not apparent. When all the PAX had deplaned; I informed the Captain of what had happened and asked for advice. He said to fill out an report because we didn't do a required briefing. The B Flight Attendant and I knew that one-on-one briefings are required; we didn't know the PAX was visually impaired.I am concerned and upset that we potentially caused a safety incident with a PAX with a visual impairment. This is unacceptable. I hope to use this as a learning experience and pay closer attention to the PAX manifest before shutting the boarding door and proactively asking all gate agents about special assist PAX that we may have onboard. I say this with caution; though. We don't always receive the correct manifest; we sometimes receive incomplete manifests with no PAX information; and sometimes we don't even receive a manifest at all. While in the end; it was my responsibility to confirm with the gate agent about special assist PAX; I feel like there was a breakdown of communication between the gate agent and me. I wonder if the gate agent knew there was a visually impaired PAX on the flight. Perhaps there could be strengthened training for gate agents and flight attendants for recognizing special assist PAX. For flight attendants; also what to do if a special assist PAX is discovered during flight and certain briefings did not occur; as in our case. As stated before; I didn't know what to do in regard to the PAX.I understand the severe safety hazards not providing a one-on-one briefing could have caused if something went wrong during flight. I hope to use this as a lesson learned and not solely rely on being informed of all special assist PAX by a gate agent. In other words; I need to be more proactive; and I need to use my resources more wisely. My hope is that this can be used as a lesson for all flight attendants so that incidents like this don't happen again. We are first and foremost a safety industry; and we failed to keep to our safety standards.,,,,Flight Attendant reported not performing safety briefing for blind passenger.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant (Party 1) who failed to provide a required one-on-one safety briefing to a visually impaired passenger (PAX) onboard the flight. The PAX was listed in the passenger manifest as needing a wheelchair and being blind, but the Flight Attendant was unaware of this until reviewing the manifest toward the end of the flight. This oversight occurred despite the manifest indicating the PAX's visual impairment. The Flight Attendant did not receive any communication from the gate agent or ground personnel about the PAX's condition. During the flight, standard safety briefings were conducted, but no special briefing was provided to the visually impaired passenger. Upon realizing the mistake during descent, the Flight Attendant briefly spoke with the PAX, who appeared to manage without assistance. After landing, the PAX deplaned independently, using only a simple walking cane, and declined the wheelchair assistance offered. The Flight Attendant reported the incident to the Captain, who advised filing a report due to the missed safety briefing, which is a regulatory requirement. The Flight Attendant expressed concern about the potential safety risks and acknowledged the need for improved communication and proactive verification of special assistance passengers. They proposed strengthening training for both flight attendants and ground personnel to better identify and address the needs of visually impaired passengers. Additionally, the Flight Attendant emphasized the importance of reviewing the passenger manifest before boarding and proactively confirming special assistance requirements with ground staff.",crew-related issues

They had to follow the company's mask policy or potentially be removed from the flight. Passengers complied but soon after we made a walk through; all the above passengers had their mask off; completely removed and not even visible.

Initially, the passengers complied, but during a later walk-through, the Flight Attendant discovered that all the previously non-compliant passengers had removed their masks entirely. The Flight Attendant notified the Captain, who instructed her to document the seat numbers of the non-compliant individuals.

They said something to me about it after my break along the lines that she was upset and combative. I was surprised; as I wore my mask (a KN95 on the ground and a solid multi-layer cloth one in the air) all times outside of the flight deck and in the flight deck if a Flight Attendant was present.  Additionally; the other First Officer did as well. The Captain wears glasses that fog easily with a mask on. He wore a mask on the ground; he did not airborne because it would greatly interfere with his duties both because he wouldn't be able to see and could not communicate. This was our 4th leg together and we had no issues with masks among ourselves or other flight attendants.  Additionally; both the Captain and other First Officer already had COVID which they had gotten from people they knew at home; not in the workplace. Before our next rest room break I got out a new unused N95 mask for the Flight Attendant that would be in the flight deck while I was in the bathroom. When I called back and ask for the break she ordered me that the pilot remaining in the flight deck should wear the crew oxygen mask.  I said that was not something that we did anymore-the practice stopped months ago because of COVID.   I offered her the N95 for extra protection because the Captain can't wear a mask and do his job.  She refused it.  Instead continuing to wear what appeared to be a single layer stretchy black cloth mask. Additionally the flight attendant blocking the cart was wearing a KN95 but the Lead FA did not send her into the flight deck. I found the flight attendant to not be willing to exercise self-help and any wearing of an N95 and apparent multiple complaints to be a distraction from my flight duties.

The Lead Flight Attendant offered an N95 mask as an extra precaution, given the Captain's difficulty in wearing a mask while fulfilling his duties. This offer was refused, with the flight attendant continuing to wear a single-layer cloth mask. This refusal led to the flight attendant's distress and complaints, which distracted from crew coordination and resulted in a reported issue with CRM (Crew Resource Management).

He further alleged that I knew about this prior to takeoff. I responded that I was not aware of any such issue; and would not have departed had I known. He said he had cell phone video and observed the aft FA (Flight Attendant) make a interphone call to the cockpit. Noting this was a serious safety issue. I concurred with him that if this occurred it was indeed a safety issue and that I would investigate and report as required; but I had not received an interphone call from the FA. He reiterated the cell phone video and stated his intent to submit it to [the company] and the FAA. He provided no further details; nor showed me the video; and departed. As background; the flight was operating about 5 hours late due to aircraft non-availability. Once we had an aircraft; we boarded and waited another 25 mins or so for a replacement FO (First Officer) as the original FO was now projected illegal. The new FO was a [distantly-based] new hire; but this had little if any impact on the flight. On taxi out we stopped for about 20 minutes in the west hard stand to receive a complete weather reroute from ATC; reentered the new route; got approval from dispatch to operate on the new route; changed runways and departures; briefed and accomplished flows and checklist. We had 4 minutes to make our [Departure Time]. I immediately made the 'FA prepare for Takeoff PA'; cleared to line up and wait by ATC; cycled the seat belt chime to alert FAs we were taking the runway; sat for 15-20 seconds and were cleared for takeoff. Uneventful flight to ZZZ till passenger approached me (FO was already gone) at gate in ZZZ. All of this delay information just indicates that passengers; especially a small child; might well have needed to use the lavatory. So I did query the Flt Attendants about this incident. The aft FA did make an interphone call to the #1 FA; following his chain of command; to advise that a father had taken his son into the restroom. The #1 FA told me he did not contact us on the Flt Deck because we had 'already started rolling for takeoff' and he was concerned about violating the sterile cockpit in a critical phase of flight. He made a quick decision that overall safety was better served by not contacting us. Clearly taking off with anyone in the lavatory is unsafe and against [company] SOPs. Unclear to me in this event is exactly when the father and child entered the lavatory. If during the hold short or line up and wait (15-20 secs) phase; a call could be appropriate to the cockpit to alert us of the situation. We could decline the takeoff clearance and clear the runway as needed. If in fact we were accelerating (rolling?) for takeoff; the passengers' safety may be more compromised by the rapid deceleration of a rejected takeoff. The FA's situational awareness is limited to our departure PA; and taking the runway chime followed by aircraft movement and engine noise. This limited input could affect their decision making process as to where we are in the takeoff maneuver.Secondly; I'm concerned about communication. I brief the #1 FA on every flight; I believe this to be important since we now fly with many different crews; from many different bases; frequently different on every leg. I did so on this flight to relay details of the flight and to open up communication. Still no one called to advise us of this event during the entire flight. I only learned about it from the concerned passenger at the arrival gate. Kind of blindsided. Not even the father in the lavatory said anything. Of note there were 10 uniformed crew members on the flight who said nothing when departing; though they may not have been in a position to observe anything. Bottom line is passenger safety is paramount; I believeunless we're on high speed takeoff roll; we could have handled a reject safely if notified. Perhaps a more assertive approach by the FA would have prevented this event from progressing to a takeoff with passengers not in their seats.,,,,A321 Captain reported being informed after landing of passenger using lavatory during previous takeoff roll.,"A passenger reported to the flight captain that a father and small boy were in the lavatory during takeoff. The passenger provided a cell phone video showing an interphone call made by a flight attendant to another crew member, who then did not contact the cockpit to avoid violating sterile cockpit rules during a critical phase. The flight experienced multiple delays, including aircraft unavailability and weather reroutes, leading to a near-miss of the departure time. The flight attendant involved made an interphone call but did not inform the cockpit, leaving the captain unaware of the situation until post-landing. The captain expressed safety concerns, emphasizing the importance of timely communication during takeoffs to allow for safe aborted takeoffs if necessary. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication protocols, especially with diverse crews, to prevent similar occurrences and ensure passenger safety.",crew-related issues

Remind herself to do it.  I checked instead.  Second; during all call; she did not know how to use the interphone. Had to ask FA2 to verify with FA4; the customer talked to me it was a concern if she knows what she is doing when I walked-thru the aisle during flight.  Third; when a customer had an issue with FA4 during boarding; FA4 told us the customer said to her 'Damn ass;' we solved a problem with MOD and the agent on the ground to make sure FA4 is ok.

After speaking with the PAX (Passenger) she informed me that she had a highly contagious disease. After speaking with her; She explained that her illness wasn't airborne but someone could contract it if they touched anything she'd touched. I asked her for her name. Although; it was turbulent and we were on final descent; I contacted the cockpit they were informed of what was going on. I was told he couldn't talk at that time but did I need me Paramedics to meet us at the gate. I asked him to have a Supervisor meet the plane. The PAX was not in distress and showed no signs of needing immediate medical attention; therefore I didn't call for medical assistance. Once at the gate pure chaos erupted. Ops quickly opened the door allowed me to get off the plane then close and locked the jet bridge door which prohibited anyone from deplaning. I was trying to explain what was going on; meanwhile the Captain was trying to get into the jet bridge. I had to open the the door for him. Then I was told to make an announcement telling the PAX not to deplane. I checked on the UM (Unaccompanied Minor) and make sure he understood that he was okay. There were several Supervisors present. I was simultaneously speaking to them and Inflight. We had to wait for clearance to allow PAX off the plane. Together with Ops and Supervisors gathered all the facts so that they could inform the UM's parent's of the possible exposure. I was trying to keep the PAX that was in that same row with the ill PAX and the UM from deplaning as requested by the Supervisors. Pax were cleared to deplane; Supervisor took care of the UM and the PAX in that row deplaned with me getting her information. After everyone deplaned; I helped the ill PAX off the aircraft. I returned to the plane and cleaned the row with our onboard disinfectant. After that; I was talking to the Inflight SUP; trying to help a crew change; speaking with the Captain; updating my crew; and telling the outbound crew they could come down the jet way and board the aircraft. I did not get all the ill PAX information to put in my IR.Once we landed the pilots could have called us back and clarify what was going on. I feel if that would have happened; ground ops would not have went into lock down. Collectively we could have came up with a plan. Everyone plays a vital role but sometimes if we are not flying the plane we are made to feel less than for lack of a better word. I could only communicate the information I was given . We were in final descent but once we landed I did not feel comfortable contacting the cockpit. Once we landed the Captain never tried to contact us to clarify what was going on; which created a problem once we got to the gate and he was locked in. It was only at that time that he wanted know what was going on.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant in Charge reported a communications breakdown between Flight Attendant and flight crew shortly after being notified of a passenger with a 'highly contagious disease'.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between a flight attendant and the flight crew of a B737 aircraft, triggered by the presence of a passenger with a highly contagious disease. The flight attendant was informed by another crew member about the passenger, who had pre-boarded and requested that her seat be cleaned with Clorox after deplaning. Upon speaking with the passenger, the flight attendant learned that the individual had a contagious illness, which could be transmitted through contact but was not airborne. Despite the turbulence and being on final descent, the flight attendant contacted the cockpit, informing them of the situation. The cockpit, occupied by the captain, was unable to communicate at that time but was advised to have a supervisor meet the plane at the gate. The passenger was not in distress and did not require immediate medical attention, so the flight attendant did not call for emergency services. Upon landing, chaos erupted at the gate. Operations staff opened the door, allowing the flight attendant to deplane, but then locked the jet bridge, preventing other passengers from exiting. The captain attempted to enter the jet bridge, and the flight attendant was forced to open the door for him. The flight attendant was instructed to make an announcement asking passengers to remain on the plane, while supervisors gathered to collect information and inform the parents of an unaccompanied minor (UM) about potential exposure. The flight attendant worked to prevent the UM and other passengers in the affected row from deplaning, as requested by supervisors. Once cleared, passengers, including the UM, were allowed to exit, with the flight attendant collecting the ill passenger's information. After everyone had deplaned, the flight attendant assisted the ill passenger off the aircraft, cleaned the affected row with onboard disinfectant, and continued her duties, including coordinating with the inflight supervisor, the captain, and the outbound crew. The incident highlighted a breakdown in communication post-landing, as the captain did not contact the cabin crew to clarify the situation, leading to confusion and the subsequent lockdown. The flight attendant expressed frustration with the lack of communication and the resulting delays, suggesting that a coordinated approach could have been achieved if the captain had communicated with the cabin crew after landing. The proposed solution was for the captain to contact the cabin crew post-landing to avoid the lockdown and develop a unified plan. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of clear communication and collaboration among all crew members, regardless of their role.",crew-related issues

The Captain was already there; we said hello; [and] I did my walk around then started my preflight duties. As we were boarding; we were having the standard (where are you from) conversation. Captain told me he lives out of base and is relatively new to ZZZ. He then said he was actually thinking about changing bases soon because he can't take the attitudes of ZZZ First Officer's. Personally; I have been a ZZZ First Officer for 5 years and have never heard of a problem. Being concerned; I asked what's been going on. He never really gave me an example; but he basically said that these First Officers have a problem with challenging the Captain. Then he said that he is sure that we won't have that issue on this trip because I don't seem like that type of guy. Then he continued and told me that if I do want to play the game of who knows more; that he promises that it won't end well for me. I assured him that I don't play those games and I only speak up if it's a safety issue or I feel it necessary. And that was about the extent of my briefing from the Captain. I thought it was odd that at this day and age; my briefing was basically 'don't challenge the Captain'. I then told him that he can't hurt my feelings and to please speak up if he sees me making a mistake.At this time; Maintenance comes into the flight deck to tell us a tire that was questionable was well within their limits and that we were good to go. Maintenance questioned what guidance we had and we explained our guidance is much different than theirs; usually more conservative. I gave the mechanic the example of the hydraulic fluid quantities and their 'normal fill' range. The book states if it is at all outside of those limits; even for thermal expansion; that we are required to call Maintenance. The Captain then spoke up and said that wasn't true as they've added a note saying that as long as we don't have any ECAMs that we don't have to call Maintenance. I was surprised he said that and asked when it changed. He said it changed a long time ago; probably 6 months ago. I said that I must have missed the change and we moved on. During the taxi; we had a crosswind that was technically a 1 knot tailwind. I said ok no problem; TOGA take off and I'll go to the TPS and work the number. Captain told me not to use the TPS but to just request a new TPS using 'request T.O. Data' and put the tailwind in there. I said that doesn't work. You can compute the tailwind penalty manually or call and have a new TPS sent with the tailwind penalty added. He said 'oh really; well you're the only First Officer that seems to think that'. He then continued and told me that about 30 of his last First Officer's requested a new TPS with the tailwind. I said that I found that odd because they make it every clear in training that you cannot do this. I asked if I could just do this manually for now and we could talk about the tailwind and the TPS during our flight to ZZZ1. He agreed. As I was heads down doing the penalty; the Captain was swerving down the taxiway because he was also heads down doing the same thing. I said I'll take care of this so you can taxi. He said no it's ok; I'm good at taxiing. So a short time later; I said ok we have a TOGA take off and our penalty is 970 LBS. off MTOW. He said; not its 1;050 [LBS]. I said ok maybe I looked at it wrong. I looked again and it was in fact 970 lbs. He looked again and agreed as he saw his mistake. We were legal to take off. Once we were on our way and not busy with ZZZ; I looked up the note about the normal fill for the hydraulics. I read the note and it still says we are required to call Maintenance. I showed the Captain. He read it and was surprised that it said what it said and that he must have missed the last sentence. We moved on and I said let's look at the TPS. I said that; like the hydraulic issue; I'm looking this up for my own personal knowledge. Things change all the time and who knows; maybe [Company] pushed the button that allows us to grab a new TPS with a tailwind. So I said I'll request a new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind and see what it says. He said; we are in flight; you can't request a new TPS because we are in flight. I said sure you can and pushed the button and spit it out. I showed him the new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind compared to our original TPS and both were identical. The Captain was in the TPS flow chart in the QRH and was in disbelief that it didn't say that you could request a new TPS with a tailwind. He then said 'damn it if I'm going to lose a beer over this'. At this point; I stopped him and said the he wasn't going to lose a beer because we aren't playing a game of who knows what. There have been a ton of changes and if something as important as when to call Maintenance or how to know if we're legal for takeoff; I want to know. That was it. At this point I realized that tension was building. The Captain was irritated that I was challenging him. I decided at this point that I wasn't going to speak up unless I absolutely had to. Now one thing I didn't mention was that the Captain briefed the flight attendants to stay seated for 1 hr and 30 minutes after takeoff as a precaution because of what was left of the hurricane. We were routed around to the north of it but he still kept them down. I thought that was excessive. The ride was smooth. I didn't say anything. Nor did I say a thing when we had to deviate around cells. He would do an all call and tell everyone to take their seats. We were deviating a long way around these cells and I had absolutely no doubt that it would be a smooth ride. We even had reports from other aircraft that the ride was smooth. The other thing I felt was odd; was that less than one minute after he called the flight attendants; he was surprised that they were still dealing with their carts and not already in their seats. I honestly don't think he has any idea what the flight attendants have to do to clean up and sit down. The flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 was mostly smooth. We have specific guidance in regards to the ride quality when it comes to flight attendants and passengers.Either way we had an uneventful flight to ZZZ1 and we had good conversation. The next morning we were getting ready for our leg back to ZZZ. We were ready for departure but I believe we had to wait for traffic behind us. The Captain put the delay for pay purposes into ACARS. I was just making small talk and said I heard there was a potentially easier way of doing it that might save him time. This set him off. The Captain kept saying; almost yelling 'it's amazing when you upgrade everyone tries to prove you wrong. Just you wait; it's amazing. Everyone just tries to prove you wrong.' This little rant went on for an uncomfortable amount of time. I finally stopped him and said that is absolutely not what I'm trying to do and that I'm sorry that I somehow came off that way. I said that there have been so many big changes that it's very difficult to keep up and so easy to miss. I told him how just last month I was told that I was doing a checklist incorrectly. We looked it up and sure enough they were correct. I told him there were no hard feelings and I was glad it was brought to my attention. That was the end of that conversation.  I want to be clear the reason I wrote such detail about the events leading up to the diversion is because I think it's important and can better understand how we ended up in ZZZ2. It's my leg to ZZZ from ZZZ1. We are in a full 320. We have been airborne for less than 20 minutes. The Captain is eating his kung pow kitty as the Flight Attendant calls. She said she turned the oven on and about 1 minute later smoke started coming out. Captain asked if she turned it off and she said she did. He instructed her not to open the oven and that we are diverting. He hangs up with her; looks at me and said smoke in the cabin; we're going down now! Before I could say a word he grabs the mic and [advises ATC] and said we needed to get on the ground immediately. He then dons his O2 mask even though there wasn't even a hint of smoke or even a smell in the flight deck. Because his was on; I grabbed mine. After about 2 minutes; the Captain realized he couldn't communicate very well and he takes it off; as do I. Now I can't remember if we knew on initial contact that the oven was no longer smoking or if it was just a few minutes later. Either way; the Captain and I knew that there were dinner rolls in the oven; it started smoking 1 minute after she turned it on and that it stopped smoking as soon as she turned the oven off.I could not believe we were diverting....for toast. The Captain was busy running the smoke in the cabin checklist and I was flying the plane and talking to ATC. I strongly considered talking to the Captain and asking if we should possibly reconsider the diversion since it doesn't seem to be a safety of flight issue. Considering the way he has responded to any type of questioning; and the fact that he was currently deep in the yellow and headed for the red; if I questioned his judgement; it would have put him through the roof and that would have been very unsafe in any phase of flight; especially a diversion. I decided the safest course was to just go along with his diversion and not question him. During the diversion; he must have fired off a text to Dispatch saying we needed to divert. I don't know what his message said. Initially I suggested we turn back towards ZZZ1. So we did. I then realized we were far too heavy for the short runway. I pulled up ZZZ3 and it was too far for the Captain. At this time Dispatch responds and said to divert to ZZZ2. I plug it in and it was 40 miles to the East. I said Dispatch said to go to ZZZ2. He said that's where he wants to go also. I told ATC and we started to head that way. I slowed the plane down to give us time; changed destination and set up for the ILS. I did the landing distance for our weight and it said around 8;000 feet; we had 13;200 feet. I briefed the Captain and told him I was doing flaps full with manual auto brakes. Since we had such a long runway I was going to stay off the brakes until under 100 kts to keep them from getting too hot. I told him I already spoke with ATC and said we'd either make a right turn off or back taxi. He cut me off and said we were going to be stopping on the runway and having the trucks look us over with their equipment and look for any hot spots and to also check our brake temps. I had a nice touchdown and used the brakes as I briefed. We came to a stop and watched the trucks surround us. As we sit there we put the brake fans on; the temps never got over 220. Minutes go by and I said I'll use this time to call Tower and ask exactly where we are parking. I got snapped at by the Captain once again. He said I needed to calm down and to stop interfering with their emergency procedures. A short time later; Tower called us asking if we were ready to taxi yet. Captain responded that after the fire trucks have looked us over and checked our brake temps that we'd then be able to taxi. Tower said he were completely fine. Again; our brake temps were never above 220. Captain tells Tower we are ready to taxi and we do. There were ramp personnel waiting for us and they parked us on the ramp just before where they park the RJ's so we don't block them. Air stairs are brought to our plane and the fire fighters confirm there is no fire and they leave. At this point we haven't deplaned. Captain looked to me and said he said he was done flying and that it would be unsafe for us to continue due to the nature of the high stress emergency. I said that I think we should consider just getting fuel and continuing. Of course we needed an overweight inspection. He said we were done. So now we needed to get the passengers to the terminal. The Captain deemed it unsa,,,,A320 First Officer reported less than optimal CRM combined with smoke in the cabin caused by dinner rolls in the oven; which ultimately led to a diversion.,"The incident began with a briefing where the Captain expressed concerns about past First Officers challenging his authority, which the First Officer found unusual. Disagreements arose regarding procedures, such as requesting a new TPS in flight, leading to growing tension. During the return leg, smoke from the oven, caused by burning dinner rolls, prompted the Captain to divert to ZZZ2. Despite the First Officer's consideration of continuing, the Captain, under stress, opted for an overweight inspection and refused to proceed further. This resulted in a delay, with passengers disembarking and the aircraft being parked for the night.",crew-related issues

One; if the crew never left the gate when they encountered a power distribution irregularity when switching from ground to APU power. Two; if Line Control had a Jetway Operator standing by at the gate. And three; if there was a better and clearer communication between the maintenance crew.I received a gate call on the radio; that Aircraft X was coming back to the gate; due to a 'Warn Elec' message on EICAS. I was informed by Line Control that Aircraft X was returning to the gate and was asked if I needed the jetway to be pulled up. I replied 'Yes I will need the jetway pulled up'. Myself and two mechanics that were assigned to Aircraft X; headed out to the gate. As we approached the gate; the ground crew were getting ready to greet the aircraft; no Jetway Operator. At this time I made a second request to Line Control; for a Jetway Operator. The aircraft arrives; the ground crew guide the plane in. One Mechanic jumps on the headset; the other climbs in to the E compartment to reset circuit breakers.I was thumbing through the iPad; looking for possible causes in the AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) and FIM (Fault Isolation Manual) procedures. Maintenance was ready to go. Still no Jetway. At this time I decided not to wait any longer and go through the hatch of the plane and get onboard. I pointed upstairs to the Mechanic on the headset. I got his attention a second time and mouthed 'upstairs' and pointed upwards again. He nodded. As I am climbing in the E compartment; I got the other Mechanic's attention. He had told me that he reset circuit breakers and that I should see if the message cleared. I agreed.I banged on the hatch before opening it; then proceeded to crack it open. I saw light; looked clear to open. Heard a yell; then a foot come through; hitting me on the head; face; then right shoulder. I reacted by catching a foot with a black shoe and proceeded to hoist the foot to safety; by placing it in the galley on solid ground. I got out and I saw an elderly gentleman; a Flight Attendant; sobbing from pain sitting down. At this point I headed into the cockpit and I started pushing buttons to clear the message. No help. The First Officer and the Observer were explaining the problem they encountered before leaving the gate initially. The Captain was more concerned with the Flight Attendant; than getting this plane out. He took his time and explained to the passengers in great detail of the happenings that occurred. He should have just assured the passengers that matters would be solved quickly and swiftly; instead of shining the light on us maintenance. He was very rude and never once did anyone ask me if I was okay.Now; people are starting to show up. Port Authority police; some safety members from our maintenance department; one other mechanic. Through this bad ordeal; I am disappointed as to treatment that I was subjected to by the Port Authority police; the Captain and one female flight attendant; who felt that her opinion mattered more than the professionalism required to maintain in front of our customers. It never ceases to amaze me on how insignificant we as mechanics are made to feel by other departments here at [Company]. I thought we were all on the same team!,,,,Mechanic reported that a Flight Attendant was injured when he accidentally stepped through an open floor hatch.,"The incident occurred when a maintenance crew responded to a 'Warn Elec' message on an aircraft, leading them to attempt resetting circuit breakers. Due to a delay in obtaining a jetway operator, the maintenance team proceeded without one, resulting in a mechanic entering the aircraft through an open hatch. During this process, a flight attendant accidentally stepped through the hatch, causing injuries to both the flight attendant and the mechanic. The Captain's management of the situation and subsequent interaction with the maintenance crew were perceived as disrespectful, highlighting a need for improved interdepartmental communication and support systems. Proposed solutions include ensuring a jetway operator is available and enhancing communication protocols to prevent such incidents. The outcome underscores the importance of teamwork and respect in addressing technical issues efficiently.",crew-related issues

I agreed to tag team and verify she had ended her call. I walked by and she hid her phone down by her side; so I couldn't tell one way or another. I told the other FA I would check during final compliance. After our safety demo; I walked by and she was very clearly texting. I asked her to put her phone into airplane mode. I didn't want to appear that I was singling her out and hovering; so I walked away and checked on my way back up front. Again; she was very engrossed in her texting. She was sending and receiving messages and there was no airplane mode icon on her phone. It showed she had service. Again; I told her that her phone needed to be in airplane mode. I told her that we needed her to comply and put her phone in airplane mode now. She looked up at me; visibly annoyed; turned her phone away and said 'Yeah.' When I was standing there; she made no attempt to turn her phone into airplane mode. I didn't have a visual of the phone anymore but to my knowledge; she never did. Enroute; we caught a couple glances of her cell phone; every time it was not in airplane mode. It wasn't as if she was unaware; she actively chose not to comply.This passenger was a [premium frequent flyer]. Normally; passengers that are that non-compliant are asked to comply or to be removed from flight; however; neither one of us FAs felt the company would support removing a [premium member] over a compliance issue. We also feared we would have gotten in trouble if we had tried. I struggled with it because this passenger was purposely not complying and in an emergency; I don't know that I could count on her to follow crew member instructions.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being unwilling to report passenger misconduct due to the possibility of company retribution.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and a premium frequent flyer passenger. The flight attendant requested the passenger to end her phone call and switch to airplane mode as the cabin door was closing. Despite repeated requests, the passenger ignored the instructions and continued using her phone, which remained connected to service. The flight attendant hesitated to enforce compliance due to concerns about company retribution and potential trouble for removing a premium member. As a result, the passenger's non-compliance persisted throughout the flight, leaving the flight attendant uncertain about the passenger's reliability in an emergency.",crew-related issues

Saturdays are busier than normal but no effort to adjust that today.  Then management assigns domestic on what they thought was an open desk [XX] but that desk was open and they make that domestic dispatcher who showed at XA00 to move off the desk they assigned in error to desk [XX] one and half hours after being here; in that time of moving desk to desk [YY] they received several calls (please note that releases have that desk number on it) so the one remaining international desk [ZZ] has to now answer and transfer the calls to correct desk; while working their new workload which is in beginning of shift and they are also working to remain in control of desk. The Domestic Dispatcher is now rushing to move and reset up and transfer flights between desks; and of course there are several calls and now all desks in international which where reduced by two are forced to help the lone domestic dispatcher with these issues; in addition.  Now that this Dispatcher moved all but one flight was moved that was caught by incoming Dispatcher and moved to the original desk that had it on the domestic side since new Dispatcher was also on a call and still trying to set up their new desk.  The phones kept ringing on wrong desk and the lone Domestic Dispatcher asked for help not knowing that two of the International Dispatchers where already on phone with the Domestic Dispatchers other issues.  I asked the International Dispatcher next to me to get the Chief to lend assistance but they where in the bridge morning meeting discussing the weather and daily assignments.  The International Dispatcher came back to report that Chief was unavailable; and I suggested that the Chief needs to leave that meeting and help domestic dispatcher for they are swamped and bringing down the entire Caribbean team; so the other dispatcher went to Chief and insisted on getting help for domestic dispatch and fortunately there was a Chief in training who came down to answer phones and lend a hand.  The phone calls I took where Flight ABCD time off gate was generated in error and needed to be removed; Flight DAEE was in ZZZ going to ZZZ1 and they where given a ground delay and ATC re-route so then I had to get reroute ensure compliance build that route and verify that we had petrol to accomplish this: I got so in detailed with this issues I did not get time out and I had to ask International Dispatcher to remove that time.  While working on weather briefing and re-route another of the Domestic lines where ringing and all International Dispatchers where on phone so I grabbed the call and placed them on hold to finish re-route but that person hung up and then called.  I advised the captain of Flight DAEE that I would finish re-route after I briefed on weather and send them an ACARS with route and burns; since the Domestic Dispatcher was at this point under water and not coming up.  The Captain said that would be fine and I built his new route while I answered another one of the Domestic Dispatchers phone lines.  This was a flight attendant who once I answered she said they had a medical emergency and needed Medlink!  I asked for flight number while I was still engaged in the re-route for the Domestic Dispatch (placing all my international desk and its duties on lower priority).  The Flight Attendant (FA) was not using proper radio telephone procedure; nor had any patience; to connect to Medlink we need basic info flight number; age; gender; problem or issue but the FA when placed on hold thought they where disconnected and called back but to further aspirate the issue they called the original desk domestic side of room and needed to be transferred to international side of room.  So this one flight and one flight attendant had to be spoken to sternly just to remain on line with Medlink.  Now once Medlink got on lineagain the FA did not provide information had to be extracted by Medlink and that conversation was very difficult because the FA world speak pause and speak not allowing Medlink to speak or speaking over Medlink with the constant live mic one of the mics stuck open and there was a constant hiss in back ground and flight attendant kept telling doctor to speak louder and the doctor was practically yelling; finally the FA said that they could not hear so I ACARS crew to have PIC call in and speak to Medlink; since the doctor on board was saying they needed to land now; the Domestic Dispatcher got that call and remained on line with the Medlink and did divert the flight but this poor planning of management and multiple error caused problems for a international section that was already task saturated due to managements closing of several desk and distributing that international workload.Several failures:  First Management not understanding that it is not the number of flights but the quality of work and the management team has closed desk that was originally planned open based on published schedule.  Second; Management not familiar with work on quad and placed a Domestic Dispatcher on a weekend International desk; third; the decision to move was not well thought or executed and if it was not for another dispatcher an airborne flight would have been left unattended; Forth; placing a domestic dispatcher in an area by themselves with no support of other domestic dispatchers working similar area and familiar with weather; GDP; and ATC initiatives; fifth; only having one chief who was also task saturated; sixth; not having properly training flight attendants on proper radio telephone etiquette and protocol. Stop closing desk; and Staff properly (follow workload committee models numbers and not a number that is not truly representative of the actual work.  Have sector managers that come from ranks of dispatch and fully understand issues on floor or at least have them trained by dispatch instructors who have worked the floor.  Place like dispatchers together i.e. domestic working NE or ZZZ1 or SE together so highest quality of information is properly disseminated to flight crews without taking extra time and further task saturating the other dispatchers and areas.  Have an International Chief and Domestic Chief (or at least two Chiefs; who are current and qualified to better aid floor dispatchers).  Properly train all flight attendants for proper radio telephone etiquette and protocol.,,,,Dispatcher reported staffing issues resulting in being inundated with various tasks and moving from the desk to desk in order try to maintain operational control and communications with their flights.,"The incident arose from a combination of poor management decisions and miscommunication within the dispatch team, leading to a highly task-saturated workload and operational breakdown. The root cause included the reduction of international desks without adjusting the workload, assigning a domestic dispatcher to an international desk during peak hours, and insufficient staffing planning. These decisions overwhelmed the remaining dispatchers, who were forced to handle an influx of calls and re-routing of flights while managing their own workload. Additionally, a flight attendant's lack of proper radio telephone protocol compounded the issue during a medical emergency, requiring the intervention of a Chief in training to assist the overwhelmed domestic dispatcher. The result was a near-disruption of operations, with the flight being diverted due to the poor planning and lack of support.

I did hear a chime go off. I never heard 'flight attendants prepare for departure' myself; the number one and a cabin jumpseat rider were all standing up when the plane started taking off. The carts were not secure! All 3 of us stood during takeoff. The number one and myself had to hold on to carts so they wouldn't roll. Bottom line is the Captain never said 'prepare for departure.'Captain must say prepare for departure...if he doesn't we might think that chime was just a call light or something of that nature.,,,,Flight attendant reported that the Captain did not notify the cabin crew before takeoff; resulting in a departure with flight attendants standing in the galley.,"The incident was triggered by the Captain's failure to issue the standard ""prepare for departure"" command before takeoff. Upon hearing a chime, the flight crew, including the flight attendant, assumed it might be a routine call light. Without the Captain's command, they stood in the galley during takeoff. The carts were not secured, requiring the crew to hold them in place to prevent movement. This situation posed a safety risk, as the crew was not properly positioned for takeoff, potentially hindering their ability to respond to emergencies. To prevent recurrence, it was emphasized that the Captain must consistently issue the ""prepare for departure"" command to ensure clarity and safety for the cabin crew.",crew-related issues

The agent informed us at the gate that they were holding the flight for incoming crew. We went ahead and boarded and shortly after the agent stated they were boarding anyway. After boarding was complete; the gent came on and said we were going on the trip since the other crew was not there and that crew scheduling would call. I updated my flight and looked at crew portal where I saw that I had been placed on a trip to ZZZ1 that was supposed to leave a bit later. The door was shut and taxiout started. I started the safety video and my phone rang from crew scheduling. I answered the call; thinking that I needed to; since there was confusion about the working crew and the ZZZ trip listed. Crew scheduling told me to go directly to the gate for the ZZZ trip and I informed them our pre-board had been told by the agent we were going. They told me they had no idea that we were taking the ZZZ1 trip. After hanging up; the video was still playing for safety and I knew that I probably should not have answered the phone.I know not to answer my phone on board the aircraft.,,,,Flight attendant reported answering a phone call from crew scheduling during taxi; resulting in a policy violation.,"The incident occurred due to confusion regarding crew assignments. A flight attendant was called to assist with pre-boarding a flight to ZZZ and was informed by the gate agent that they would board as the incoming crew was delayed. After boarding, the pilot announced they were departing, and the attendant noticed a discrepancy in their assigned trip on the crew portal. During taxi, the attendant's phone rang from crew scheduling, prompting them to answer despite knowing they shouldn't use their phone on the aircraft. This led to a policy violation. The result was a reprimand for the flight attendant, who received additional training on communication protocols. This incident highlights the importance of adhering to established procedures, particularly regarding electronic device usage during critical flight phases.",crew-related issues

The flight attendant, conducting a compliance check in first class, noticed the door remained open and informed the captain that the cabin was not secure. Despite this, another flight attendant incorrectly reported the cabin as secure, leading to the pushback proceeding. This action posed a significant security risk.

Flight Attendant A was in boarding position during boarding; but may have been temporarily distracted by a request from the flight deck when the [passenger of small stature] boarded. Flight Attendant C had not asked for assistance or confirmation regarding the suitability of the [passenger of small stature] for overwing exit row seating. When Flight Attendant A returned to the forward jumpseat; she asked Flight Attendant C about the passenger and whether she thought the passenger met the requirements. Flight Attendant A had noticed that the [passenger's] feet were sticking out just beyond the seat. Flight Attendant C assured Flight Attendant A that she had asked this passenger if she could perform the duties and had been answered in the affirmative.The passenger was seated and the plane was moving when Flight Attendant A first saw her. Flight Attendant A could not estimate the passenger's height or mobility at this time.Since evacuations are such a rare event; flight attendants frequently do not want to risk a passenger confrontation or worse; a claim of discrimination by someone in a protected group. However; a person claiming to have a disability may not be likely to meet the requirements; and be disqualified from overwing exit row seating.The Safety Information Card states that a person who sits in the exit row must have sufficient strength and dexterity to toss objects the size of the exit row window (approximately 50 lbs.) over seats. Of course; in the past; we actually had to remove the window. While it is no longer necessary to pull the window out and toss it over seats; it is likely that in an emergency an ABA [Able Bodied Assistant] at the overwing exit might have to wrestle luggage away from exiting passengers and toss it over seats. An ABA would also be expected to be able to assist other passengers.When the [passenger] exited the aircraft; Flight Attendant A noticed that she was approximately as tall as the G7 counter; about 42 inches. She was not especially stout; and probably weighed 80-90 lbs. Considering that she was only 3.5 feet tall; it is unlikely that she had the strength or stature to toss heavy objects over seats; or even lift something that weighed more than half her weight; or manipulate something the size of an overwing exit window. The proportionally shorter arms and legs of [small stature passengers] impact mobility.Flight Attendants are deathly afraid to be charged with discriminating or have a scene that could result in negative media. Additionally; the Flight Attendant runs the risk of not being backed up by the Customer Service Representative if they call for assistance.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger of small stature sat in the exit row and caused doubt as to whether she would be capable of assisting in an emergency.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant (Party1) who noticed a passenger of small stature seated in the overwing exit row. During boarding, the Flight Attendant was distracted and did not immediately assess the passenger's ability to assist in an emergency. Another Flight Attendant confirmed the passenger's capability without further evaluation. Post-departure, the Flight Attendant questioned the passenger's height and mobility, noting she was approximately 42 inches tall and weighed 80-90 lbs., making it unlikely she could perform necessary tasks. The concern arose due to the risk of discrimination claims and negative media, which deters Flight Attendants from challenging such situations. The result highlighted the need for a proposed solution: evaluating passengers' abilities before assigning exit row seating.",crew-related issues

It became apparent that while we thought he was sleeping with the blanket covering his head he had indeed been puffing his cigarette. (A-FA) then realized when she thought she had smelled a faint cigarette odor in FC (First Class) but found no smoke or anything in the lav she chalked it up to being on someone's clothes. These types of cigarettes are a newer items that are smokeless and quite odorless as well. He was standing outside baggage claim as we were walking to our crew van so (C-FA) and myself politely went up to him and mentioned that we had found his smokeless cigarettes around his seat. Our intention was to politely tell him that it was a fine-able offense and so for future flying he'd have been warned. However before we finished speaking he started berating us and our airline; using explicit language and saying we are the worst airline he's ever experienced and that the cigarettes had fallen out of his pocket. He said that he had already tweeted a negative review and was awaiting [TV New Channel] response and to get the '[Expletive deleted]' which (C-FA) and I remained calm and polite and walked away knowing anything else we might say would fall on deaf ears. During our agricultural form pass-out of the flight we had limited quantities so I allowed a few traveling families to include their elderly grandparents on their forms so that we had enough. (Literally we were short only 2 forms on walk through). [Passenger] said he heard that and was notifying [State] Agriculture that we allowed them to lie on their forms. However we had a few families take extra forms and then delivered those to previously stated families to fill out for the grandparents so his allegations were obviously not true. He was a very rude passenger and escalated any event on this flight to create a very hostile work environment. Earlier submitted report:We had a very disgruntled first time [Airline] flyer occupying seat XX.His first grievance was that we could not serve him a double bourbon upon boarding and then became pissed when he realized we served our pre-departure beverages in plastic glasses and refused his sparkling white wine when it was handed to him. His companion then requested a pillow which I told them we did not have and his response was 'Do you guys have [expletive deleted] anything'; I apologized and walked away. During the flight while I was guarding for a Pilot break he tried to stand and come forward; I politely explained I needed everyone to remain seated as the pilots were utilizing the lav. He began to complain once seated again that this was '[expletive deleted] unnecessary and he's never seen it before'...he then got impatient and got up to attempt going to the aft and rudely made his way past our C doing a water service cussing under his breath. While there was no personal damage done; his choice of foul language and bad attitude is worth mentioning seeing as our normally favored [Airline] service was not enjoyed by him and he may write one healthy complaint.[Passenger] should not be allowed to fly our airline and should be fined for his obvious rule breaking behavior. He was defiant and apparently has trouble understanding our responsibilities as a crew.,,Mid flight I noticed I smelled cigarettes around row X; and after looking could not locate the origin of the smell; and saw no smoke. At this point I figured someone had smoked before we left and had shifted positions and the smell was suddenly released from their clothing.

After a little research we realized they were smokeless cigarettes. When letting our crew know; (Flight Attendant B) found one more.

(Flight Attendant D) and (Flight Attendant B) informed him as they passed on the way to the shuttle that that kind of behavior is a fine able offense.Crew to be made aware of the situation on his original flight. Agents should inform him before he boards that this kind of behavior is illegal and flight attendants can and will in force FAA rules.,,Flight attendants reported finding smokeless cigarette butts and confronting passenger in baggage area.,"The incident involved a passenger (Party2) and a flight attendant (Party1) aboard a flight. The flight attendant discovered three smokeless cigarette butts in the first-class cabin near the passenger's seat. Despite the passenger appearing to sleep with a blanket over his head, the flight attendant noticed the butts and an odor she initially dismissed as clothing scent. Upon deplaning, the flight attendant and a colleague confronted the passenger about the butts, explaining it was a fineable offense. The passenger responded with explicit language, blaming the butts on his pocket and claiming he had already filed a negative review. During the flight, the passenger was confrontational, complaining about alcohol service and using offensive language. He disregarded crew instructions to remain seated and made inappropriate comments. His behavior disrupted the cabin environment and created a hostile atmosphere for the crew.The flight attendants also managed a situation where they allowed extra forms for families with elderly grandparents, despite a shortage. The passenger falsely accused them of misconduct, which was later proven baseless. The result was a disruptive and hostile environment for the crew, prompting concerns about the passenger's potential legal action or future banning from the airline. The flight attendant documented the passenger's behavior, highlighting his defiance and disregard for crew responsibilities.",crew-related issues

However, due to a hectic pre-takeoff taxi process, where passengers repeatedly needed to be reminded to sit down and fasten their seatbelts, the information was inadvertently forgotten. The lead FA proposed a potential solution: implementing a system in the computer to denote FFDOs with a triangle symbol, which could help ensure the information was readily accessible during busy boarding or pre-takeoff procedures.

The crew was; at that moment not aware of any inoperative chiller on the aircraft. During the briefing with the Captain; and after checking the list of maintenance issues in my link; there was no mention about an inoperative chiller. The two carrier boxes posed a significant tripping hazard to our customers boarding; but the catering representative refused to remove the carrier boxes; stating that the flight attendants should take them on board. The carrier boxed where too heavy to lift; and it is my understanding that we should not carry heave carrier boxes full of dangerous goods through an aircraft with customers on board. An In-flight Supervisor was in the area and was unhelpful in resolving this dangerous situation.

I had my MFD on the status page before push and all doors showed green. We did before start flows and before start checklist. We were cleared to push and also to cleared to start engines shortly thereafter. I reached over and started engine one. The number one engine was fully online and had stabilized when we received a master caution. The EICAS message was saying that the front door on the FO (First Officer) side was ajar. By this time we had completed the push and the ground crew was working on getting the airplane ready for taxi. The Captain called back to the flight attendants to check on the door and maybe try to recycle it. We sat there as we heard the Flight Attendant try to get the door shut. After a few seconds of messing with the door; I heard a loud hiss and the airplane started shaking. At that point we had determined that the slide had been deployed. The Flight Attendant then called to let us know what had happened. He tried opening the door and then closing it again. This was an honest mistake and had no malicious intent. It was an abnormal situation in a high pressure environment.The cause could've been a quick misinterpretation of wording between the crew. The FA (Flight Attendant) was told to recycle the door and I've heard that wording can be misinterpreted throughout the whole [company] fleet.Change the wording in the in-flight manual for the words 'recycling doors.' I've heard it can mean something different in all the airplanes and I guess maybe it was taken one way or [another] the night of the incident.,,After push back in ZZZ on Aircraft X; we had an accidental slide deployment. Prior to push back; I verified the doors were green and told the ramp crew we were cleared to push. As we started the number 1 engine; once it came online we received a 'DOOR SERVICE FWD OPEN' warning message. I called back to the flight attendants and the number one answered. I had interrupted the safety demo that he was already doing. There must have been a perceived miscommunication as the next thing I knew there was a slide deployment. Thankfully no one was hurt when this honest mistake occurred and there was no willful intent by any crew member to deploy the slide.I believe the cause was miscommunication on the interphone between the CA (Captain) and the number one FA (Flight Attendant.) A contributing factor was the delayed flight and a rushed turn at the outstation.In the future I intend to treat any door issue similar to this event with a better initial reaction. First words to the FA will be to ensure the door is disarmed while following procedures more specifically.,,ERJ-175 flight crew reported an inadvertent emergency slide deployment after pushback.,"The incident involved an ERJ-175 flight crew and a flight attendant during departure from ZZZ. After starting the first engine, a warning indicated a forward door was ajar. The flight crew communicated with the attendant to check and recycle the door. During this, the emergency slide deployed, an inadvertent deployment with no injuries. The cause was attributed to a miscommunication regarding the term ""recycle,"" leading to confusion.

The passenger was informed to take a seat at mid to aft cabin due to distribution on the 800 aircraft; stating there is plenty of overhead bin space at the back for his carry on that seemed a bit large for the more narrow/less deep bins up front. The passenger snapped at the D Flight Attendant indicating that he was going to do what he wanted to do.Flight Attendant D recognized that the tall male passenger sat in the OWWE (Overwing Window Exit) Row. As the D made her way back she stopped to see how the passenger was doing. He was glossy eyed and loud. Flight Attendant D inquired if he had been smoking and under the influence of a substance. The passenger replied 'Yes; all day long.'  Flight Attendant D clarified if he were referring to Marijuana? The passenger replied 'Yes; I voted for it and I have been smoking all day long. We just signed a deal...' Then showing his logo/ clothing brand.The D Flight Attendant congratulated him on his business dealt then proceeded to inform the B Flight Attendant of the concern having a person under the influence of a substance in the OWWE. The B Flight Attendant concurred stating that 'Under the influence of a drug/marijuana is the same as alcohol.'The D Flight Attendant informed the A Flight Attendant of the concern then went up to the forward galley to discuss with the A [Flight Attendant]. The C Flight Attendant conducted the OWWE brief.The A [Flight Attendant] proceeded to talk to the passenger. The D Flight Attendant informed the flight deck both Captain and First Officer. No verbal response was given to the D Flight Attendant from the flight deck.The A Flight Attendant informed me; the D Flight Attendant that the man was okay.The D; said 'No he's not - he is admittedly in front of many passengers; I can smell the marijuana; under a controlled substance; approved use in Captain is only for use in the home and at a minimum he should not be in the OWWE; if even on this plane however even people who smell as if they've been drinking are not to be allowed to board.' The A Flight Attendant responded by saying; 'I spoke to him and leaned in and could not smell it.'Later the B Flight Attendant stated that he appears under the influence of marijuana/a substance and is eating a lot of pretzels; referring to the munchies.Later the C Flight Attendant stated that he (C) 'Heard how the passenger was talking to the D Flight Attendant and told him to settle down.' As the D Flight Attendant - the C heard that the passenger said he had been smoking marijuana all day long why was he allowed to remain in the overwing window exit?I think the FAM (Flight Attendant Manual) needs to clarify the term 'Intoxicated' to define if it only refers to alcohol or any substance to include marijuana; meth; speed; cocaine. Particular clarification is suggested with respect to marijuana as it is now legal in many states. However I don't think those laws supersede federal law or Federal Aviation Regulations. I think that the flight deck/ops made an error in allowing the passenger to remain in the OWWE; even if they wanted to approve a stoned/person under marijuana passenger to be able to remain on the plane. I think the fatal error was made in saying 'The A said the passenger was okay. 'If the A Flight Attendant has the final say then please clarify for crew.  The C and B Flight Attendants are still on probation and the A has not been flying too long. Being able to answer a question 'Yes; I will help' is not very reassuring when someone is under the influence of a primarily illegal substance even if it is legal in some states. It is a known fact that reaction time and mental processing of information is delayed under the influence of marijuana and other drugs; legal or illegal.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that a person under the influence of marijuana was allowed to remain seated in the emergency aisle after admitting being under the influence.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who encountered a passenger emitting the odor of marijuana. The passenger admitted to smoking marijuana throughout the day and refused to comply with instructions to move to the mid to aft cabin. Flight attendants noticed the passenger's behavior, including his glossy eyes and loud demeanor, and expressed concerns about his condition. They debated whether he should be removed from the overwing window exit seat due to safety concerns. The flight deck was informed but did not provide a verbal response. The A Flight Attendant deemed the passenger acceptable, while others, including the B and C Flight Attendants, disagreed, noting the passenger's behavior and the potential risks of marijuana use. The situation highlighted the need for clarification in the Flight Attendant Manual regarding the definition of ""intoxicated"" to include substances like marijuana, despite its legal status in some states. The crew's handling of the situation and the adequacy of their judgment were questioned.",crew-related issues

When I came around to take his order; he; confusingly reading the menu; asked for items we didn't have on the menu. He then orders a Jack and Coke. I checked his ID to make sure he was of age and said no problem. As I was taking the next rows order; he interrupts me asking where to buy the snacks. I explained to him we'd be around shortly with pretzels as our snack option. As I went back to taking orders; he interrupts me again asking if he could use the lavatory. I explained to him the seatbelt sign was on and I was not able to give him permission as long as the seatbelt sign was illuminated. At this point; I finished taking orders and waited behind the B Flight Attendant as she finished taking her last row of orders. Passenger apparently got up right after I informed him the seatbelt sign was on because I felt a hard tap on my shoulder of him explaining he had to use the bathroom. I told him politely that we both needed to wait until she was done taking her last order. At this point; I informed the B of unusually behavior from him. As I was pouring drinks and the B was putting pretzels in the snack basket; the passenger came bolting out of the lavatory; leaving the door wide open. As I went to close the door; the B and I both realized he smelled strongly of marijuana. I walked into the lavatory and smelled an even greater odor of marijuana. There is no doubt in my mind at this point; that the passenger was smoking weed in the bathroom. We went up to talk to the A; called the Captain and all decided that we needed police assistance upon landing. We also decided to monitor the passenger. Passenger appeared paranoid and edgy as he watched us call the Captain and watched each of us every time we walked by. Upon landing; police met him and questioned him. He admitted to using a vape pen but said it was not marijuana. He said he could not find said vape pen. Ultimately he had to be let go for no evidence. As passenger was walking away; he [waved] good bye to police and the vape pen fell out of his pants. He was taken into custody and I wrote a police report. The vape pen was tested positive for marijuana. Passenger also admitted to smoking in the cabin during his interrogation.,,Flight attendants reported misconduct by a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight.,"The incident involved a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight, leading to a conflict with the flight attendants. The flight attendants noticed a strong smell of marijuana when the passenger exited the aft lavatory and observed smoke inside the lavatory. The passenger appeared paranoid and initially lied to the police about his actions. The flight attendants called the captain, and upon landing, police were summoned. During questioning, the passenger denied using marijuana but later admitted to smoking in the cabin and lavatory after a vape pen, which tested positive for THC, was found in his possession. The passenger was detained, and the flight attendants reported the incident to the authorities. The flight attendant experienced throat irritation and a headache, possibly due to the effects of THC exposure. The police confirmed the vape pen contained THC, leading to the passenger's confession and detention.",crew-related issues

On the past five flights; Captains have insisted upon leaving the seat belt sign on for the entire flight. Some are so brazen they make an announcement prior to take-off advising the sign will be left on for the entire flight! Keep in mind; flying times range between 6.5 to 9.5 hours. On past flights; I have attempted to employ/educate using CRM strategies with some Captains in order to understand their reasoning behind their actions of keeping the sign on. Most express concerns about liability related to passenger injury due to unexpected severe turbulence. Others state they are doing flight attendants a favor by not cycling the sign off during late night flights - minimizing need for compliance checks. I'm deeply concerned the negative safety culture this type of behavior is creating -- a dangerous risk for passengers and crew. It encourages passengers to disobey the sign while fostering complacency among flight attendants. For example; during my last flight; FAs stopped enforcing the requirement for passengers to be buckled due to the sign being constantly on and lack of turbulence. Their reasoning (understandable); belts were unnecessary due to the smooth ride. At one point; I counted at least 15 passengers in the aisle while the sign was on. This occurred about seven hours into the flight; following the breakfast service. Clearly a violation of 121.311 and portions of 121.571. I witnessed this more often on long range flights.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant expressed concern in regard to the overuse of the seat belt.,"The incident involves concerns raised by a flight attendant regarding the excessive use of the seat belt sign by flight deck crews, particularly captains, on multiple flights. The flight attendant reported that captains frequently left the seat belt sign on for the entire duration of flights, which ranged between 6.5 to 9.5 hours. Some captains even made pre-flight announcements about this practice. The flight attendant attempted to address this issue with the captains using CRM strategies, but the captains cited concerns about liability in case of severe turbulence and claimed they were minimizing compliance checks for flight attendants during late-night flights as reasons for their actions. The flight attendant expressed deep concern over the negative safety culture this behavior was fostering, as it encouraged passengers to ignore the seat belt sign and created complacency among flight attendants. During one flight, the flight attendant observed at least 15 passengers in the aisle while the seat belt sign was on, approximately seven hours into the flight, following breakfast service. This situation violated Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 121.311 and portions of 121.571. The flight attendant noted that this behavior occurred more frequently on long-range flights. No specific solution was proposed in the context of the incident, but the flight attendant emphasized the need for addressing the safety risks associated with the misuse of the seat belt sign.",crew-related issues

In training we are told to open the lavatory; visually inspect; close the lavatory; and then lock it. The flight operations manual section states that the flight attendants will ensure the surrounding area is secure including all lavatories. B777 pilots are being verbally told to lock the lavatories doors open; language which is not in the flight operations manual. This concerns me as it is contradicting to what our security section/training calls for. Most of the time during pilot/Purser briefing I am acknowledged and the pilots comply with the proper security procedures. While working [a recent flight] I briefed the Captain as to what is required by our training. He refused to acknowledge the procedures outlined in our manual and I was forced to leave the lavatory doors open during cockpit entry/exit. This action compromised the integrity of security and left the cockpit vulnerable; however; because he was the Pilot in Command I was forced to comply.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported some pilots are requiring cockpit entry/exit procedures that are contrary to Flight Attendant training.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding cockpit entry/exit procedures. The flight attendant adhered to training and manual protocols, which require lavatory doors to be locked during cockpit access. However, some pilots have verbally instructed the flight attendants to keep the lavatory doors open, a practice not aligned with established procedures. During a recent flight, the flight attendant briefed the captain on the required security measures, but the captain refused to acknowledge them, forcing the flight attendant to leave the lavatory doors open. This compromise in security left the cockpit vulnerable. The flight attendant expressed concern over the inconsistency between training and pilot directives, which could potentially undermine safety protocols.",crew-related issues

At the same time the Number 2 FA picked up the inter-phone and began speaking. The Number 3 FA was a little bit frantic and vague in his communication. I attempted to get more information from him but he had hung up his inter-phone. About 30 seconds later; I called back to the Number 3 FA. He answered and I asked him to calm down and tell me what happened. He said the #1FA had hit his head on a 'tray table.' I asked if he was ok and did he need any medical assistance. He said the Number 1 FA was ok and no medical assistance was required. The remainder of the flight was without further issue. After parking the aircraft at ZZZ; I went back to the forward cabin to ask the Number 1 FA what happened. He had a small ice pack on his head. He removed it and had a light reddish bruise where he had obviously hit his head. I asked him to describe to me what happened. He said he was sitting in the FA jump seat; facing aft. When he stood up; he hit his head on the side of a metal tray which extends from the storage area just aft of the FA jump seat. I then asked him if he felt ok or needed medical assistance. He said he had a little bit of a 'headache' but otherwise felt ok. He said he felt ok to work the return leg to ZZZ1. He did request that when we arrived back to ZZZ1 that a supervisor meet us at the gate. I agreed that I would notify ZZZ1 Operations when we were in range. There was no turbulence or other weather related events. There were no external factors contributing to this injury. All normal procedures were being followed. All cabin crew members continue to be aware of their surrounding work environment and continue to exercise diligence. Flight attendants are trained how to handle medical situations in the cabin area and how to effectively communicate this to the flight deck. The Number 3 FA could have done a better job remaining calm; analyzing the non-life threatening situation and communicating this to the flight deck.,,,,B737-800 Captain reported poor communication with Flight Attendant relating to a Flight Attendant's injury.,"The incident occurred during the descent of a B737-800 aircraft into ZZZ, approximately 20 minutes before landing. The Number 1 Flight Attendant (FA) sustained a minor injury when his head struck a metal tray in the cabin while standing in the forward cabin. The Number 3 FA reported the injury to the flight deck via interphone, initially appearing frantic and vague. The Number 2 FA also attempted to communicate the situation. The captain, after calming the Number 3 FA, learned that the Number 1 FA was conscious, had a small bruise, and declined medical assistance. The Number 1 FA reported a minor headache but felt capable of continuing the flight. The flight landed without further issues, and the Number 1 FA requested a supervisor to meet the aircraft upon arrival at ZZZ1. The incident was attributed to a lack of awareness of the surrounding environment, though no turbulence or external factors were involved.

As we were ready to close the cockpit door; the A F/A (Flight Attendant) stated that we had 139 + 1 infant. I conferred with the [Gate] Agent; and confirmed with our F/A's that the infant was in fact in a lap and not in a seat. After a discussion on the radio; the [Gate] Agent confirmed that we did in fact have 139 + 1; as one boarding pass had not been scanned; even though that passenger had boarded. She sent us Version 2 of the Takeoff Data with the updated count; we re-accomplished the Before Push Checklist; and the flight proceeded normally.GENERAL SAFETY CONCERN: This isn't the first time I've had this situation occur. It's easiest to catch on full or nearly full flights with a senior 'C' F/A who still counts the number of empty seats before pushback. Various things can set up the situation where this error can occur; a boarding pass that isn't scanned will do it; or an [Gate] Agent who assumes that the thru count is correct without verifying can cause it as well. I've seen that too; the deplaning F/A's got a thru-count; but the [Gate] Agent never asked for it; and the oncoming F/A's were never asked or told what it was. The [Gate] Agent blindly assumed that the count was right; and she was wrong. (That error got caught because it occurred before the final passenger count was abolished.) With current procedures; if the thru-count is off and the subsequent flight isn't full; NOTHING will catch this sort of error after it gets made. 'What's the thru-count supposed to be? 28. Yeah; we have 28.' (No; you have 29; because the 4th Rider; in a seat; is staying on even though the operational information system thinks she's getting off here; but you didn't catch it because another passenger was using the lav when you counted and you weren't aware of it. Or because you got distracted during the count; and it was like 27 or 28 or something; and it's easier to say 'yeah; we have 28' than to go back and count again.) These errors happen ALL THE TIME; but now we are generally oblivious to them; whereas before the procedure change; 'count's off; have to count again' was common. Sometimes the F/A's count before push was simply off and the recount straightened everything out; but other times there was a real discrepancy between the number of people that the computer had on the aircraft; and the true number. The ramifications of errors like this are two-fold. First; the aircraft is operated with an inaccurate ZFW (Zero Fuel Weight) and Takeoff Gross Weight. This means that the aircraft is operated in a non-compliant manner with certainty; even though the actual impact of a 200 or even 400 pound error is essentially nil. Second; however; in the event of an aircraft accident; having an accurate count of Souls On Board can be absolutely vital; and an inaccurate count may be the difference between leaving someone on the aircraft who could be rescued; or sending a firefighter into an aircraft in search of an individual who was never there in the first place. In other words; an accurate count makes no difference whatsoever; until that one day when it is of life and death importance. It frankly astounds me that; at the same time that we obsess over 97 bags versus 98 bags (at 50 pounds each); with elaborate checks and verification between the ramp agents and the [Gate] Agent; we willingly forgo the best and only verification of what the computer says about our number of passengers (at 200 pounds each). How the FAA can require no counting of people actually onboard the aircraft at the same time they require exact accountability of bags; is beyond me. An extra passenger; as we had today; is four times as consequential in terms of aircraft weight as an extra bag; and infinitely more important as a soul to be rescued and accounted for in the event of an accident.The FAA should require Company to return to the previous practice of counting the actual number of people who are physically onboard the aircraft prior to pushing back from the gate. Yes; those counts take time; and when a Flight Attendant miscounts; it takes time to resolve the error. But; isn't an accurate count of the number of lives in our care worth it?,,,,B737 Captain reported an inaccurate passenger count prior to departure.,"An incident occurred involving a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding an inaccurate passenger count prior to departure. The flight captain noticed a discrepancy in the ""Souls On Board"" count, initially reporting 144 souls (138 passengers, 1 infant, and 5 crew) based on the Weight and Balance report. The flight attendant, however, stated there were 139 passengers plus an infant. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the infant was in a lap, not a seat. The flight crew consulted with the gate agent and verified the counts. A boarding pass had not been scanned, leading to the error. The gate agent confirmed the count and provided an updated Takeoff Data version, prompting a recalculation of the Before Push Checklist. The flight proceeded normally after the resolution. The flight captain highlighted that such discrepancies often occur due to unverified boarding passes or gate agents assuming counts are accurate without confirmation. They emphasized the critical importance of accurate passenger counts for aircraft weight calculations and emergency response, proposing that the FAA require a return to physically counting passengers before departure, despite the time it may take. This practice, the captain argued, ensures the safety and accurate accounting of lives on board.",crew-related issues

Both FA's (Flight Attendants) rushed through the cabin to try to assist passengers and secure the cabin. As FWD FA walked back to the galley; the momentum pushed her into a jog and she yelled at the AFT FA; 'Get down.' [AFT FA] was able to make it to her jump seat safely and secure herself. This momentum caused [another FA] to run into the flight deck door; hit her head and bounced off. Due to the stress of the situation; neither flight attendants were fully able to secure the cabin or galley before landing. FO (First Officer) said that he did do the chime but there was a system malfunction. Captain wrote up the plane after jet bridge was extended.,,,,CRJ900 Flight Attendant reported that the cabin crew was not alerted to final descent.,"The incident occurred on a CRJ900 flight when the final descent chime, intended to alert the cabin crew, malfunctioned and did not sound. As a result, the flight attendants were not promptly informed of the aircraft's preparation for landing. Approximately 20 minutes before landing, the initial descent announcement was made, and the flight attendants began securing the galley and performing last-minute tasks. However, the absence of the final descent chime caused them to remain unaware of the impending landing until they noticed street lights outside the aircraft, indicating that the landing gear was being extended. In response, the flight attendants rushed to secure the cabin and assist passengers. During this rush, the forward flight attendant was pushed into a jog and yelled for the aft attendant to ""Get down."" The aft attendant safely reached her jump seat, while another flight attendant collided with the flight deck door, sustaining a head injury. Due to the sudden and stressful situation, neither attendant was able to fully secure the cabin or galley before landing. The first officer reported that he had activated the chime but faced a system malfunction. The captain subsequently filed an incident report post-landing.

Captain insisted they could still fly without it. His alternate protocol was to open the flight deck door during takeoff and landing. Flight Attendant X was very uncomfortable with this and was saying it is against what her manual says. She was peer pressured and guilted by the Captain into operating all four flights with the flight deck door open. The company has taken on more contracts than they can handle with their fleet and amount of crew members. Aircraft have fallen into disrepair; and those who complain about it are punished; those who operate flights illegally get more money in their pockets. This Captain is notorious for flying any aircraft and allowing crew scheduling to manipulate his hours so that he can work more than what is legal for a big chunk of money. I contacted manager of inflight; Chief Pilot; Director of Operations; and Director of Safety prior to flying this morning. I showed them that the manual says 'an aircraft cannot depart if the interphone system between flight deck and cabin is inoperative.' I contacted another Captain who showed me that even on the MEL list; at least 50 percent of cabin interphones must be able to reach flight deck. None of ours did. I only received a reply from our Director of Operations saying that 'In certain circumstances it can be done.' He then stated he did not find it safe for a Captain to take off and land with the flight deck door open. However this Captain will never receive any questioning about his protocol because the company is just relieved the flights operated.,,,,Flight Attendant reported aircraft interphone was inoperative and the Captain continued the operation with flight deck door open.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and a Flight Captain regarding the operation of a flight with an inoperative interphone system. The Flight Attendant reported that the interphone system, which is a critical communication link between the flight deck and cabin, was not functioning. According to the aircraft manual, the aircraft should not depart if the interphone system is inoperative. However, the Captain insisted that the flight could proceed by opening the flight deck door during takeoff and landing as an alternative protocol. The Flight Attendant expressed discomfort with this approach, as it contradicted the manual, but was reportedly pressured and guilted by the Captain into complying with the protocol for four consecutive flights. The incident highlights issues within the company, including overloading its fleet and crew capacity, aircraft disrepair, and a culture where those who raise concerns about safety are punished, while those who operate flights illegally are rewarded financially. The Flight Attendant had previously raised concerns with multiple senior management personnel, including the Director of Operations, who acknowledged the potential safety risk but did not take definitive action to prevent the flight. The Captain, known for maximizing his flying hours and earnings, was not held accountable for his protocol, despite the risks involved. In summary, the incident reflects systemic management and safety concerns within the organization, including disregard for safety protocols, crew well-being, and regulatory compliance. A potential solution proposed was to review the manual's requirements, assess the Captain's flight hours, and investigate the interphone system's compliance with the MEL (Minimum Equipment List).",crew-related issues

So; I wrote up aft cargo door L/H blowout panel and FWD LAV upper track guide screw which was broken in half. Maintenance arrived and began to thoughtfully address the issues. I was informed by a Line Mechanic that the blow out panel was missing 3 of 4 fasteners and they were checking on if they had another panel in stock. Shortly after that; a Maintenance Foreman or Supervisor showed up and said we're all good; everything is being signed off. I didn't see the new part arrive; so I asked the Foreman if they had brought and installed a new panel. He said; 'Yes; we installed the new panel and you're good to go.' When I later spoke with the Line Mechanic who actually did the work; he said they had not installed a new part; but had just taped in the old one. So; I found the Foreman and explained to him what was wrong with the old panel (3 missing fasteners) and that reinstalling it wasn't solving the problem. At that point; his story changed and he said they had found the fasteners in the cargo bay and reinstalled them into the panel before taping it up; so once again we are good to go! Then; he left. The remaining line mechanics were completing the paper work for the LAV door repair when I told the one who had done the work in the cargo how fortunate it was that they had found the 3 missing panel fasteners to which he looked befuddled and told me they hadn't found or installed any new fasteners; just taped in the old panel. He said that was why he refused to do the sign off on that job... so the Foreman signed it off. I called Maintenance Control and asked for Maintenance to reinspect the panel and was told they would do so and then 'rub your belly'. When Maintenance arrived to reinspect the panel; I was present when he removed the tape and panel which was still missing 3 of its 4 required ball-bearing fasteners. A new panel was ordered and another write-up was requested; which I did. During the delay; passengers were receiving regular updates and provided a water service. I had also tried to arrange regress to those who wanted off to reset the ground delay clock; but the Station refused to allow only a few off - it had to be all or nothing. When the new panel was ordered I deplaned all of the passengers. The part arrived and was installed fairly quickly; so we re-boarded and were preparing to depart when someone attempted to use the forward LAV and the door fell off its upper track again. We found the upper track screw on the floor and it was the exact same dirty one that was broke in half prior to the first repair. For some unknown reason; the broken screw (bolt) was reinstalled on the LAV door; so I wrote it up again. Maintenance came out and determined a new part or whole new door would be required which they said would take at least an hour; so we deplaned all of the passengers a second time. After the new LAV door was installed; it did not fit well and was scraping metal on metal across the top of the door; making the door hard to open and close; so I asked them to adjust it. They tried; but in the end; said it was as good as it was going to get. The door did open and close just not easily which in my opinion; will probably lead to another upper track screw failure; but it was signed off; so we boarded and finally completed the flight after a 4 hour and 16 minute delay. There is no doubt in my mind that the Maintenance Foreman lied directly to my face multiple times regarding maintenance that was supposedly performed; that is not acceptable. It was an unsafe act that could have been the first link in the chain of an accident/incident had I not intervened. By trying to save an hour delay; he caused a 4+ hour delay. I was told that this push; push; push; go; go; go; get it out by whatever means possible pressure was common place for that Foreman. I am concerned that his concept of risk management allowed him to reinstall a known defective piece of safety equipment (the pressurization blowout panel); sign it off; and lie about it to the Captain. Do maintenance correct the first time. Don't falsify maintenance signoffs and don't lie to crew members about the condition of their aircraft.,,,,CRJ-900 Captain reported the aircraft was refused because the corrective action taken and explanation by Maintenance was unacceptable.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and Maintenance personnel regarding the resolution of aircraft maintenance issues on a CRJ-900 aircraft. The Flight Attendant reported two problems during boarding: a protruding aft cargo L/H blowout panel and a broken upper track guide screw on the forward lav door. Maintenance was summoned, and a Line Mechanic noted that the blowout panel was missing three of four fasteners. A Foreman arrived and assured the Flight Attendant that the issues had been resolved, claiming a new panel had been installed and signed off. However, the Flight Attendant later discovered that the old panel had only been taped in place without the missing fasteners. The Foreman's story changed, claiming the fasteners had been found and reinstalled, but this was contradicted by the Line Mechanic, who admitted no new fasteners had been installed. The Flight Attendant raised concerns, leading to a reinspection by Maintenance, which confirmed the panel was still missing fasteners. A new panel was ordered, and passengers were deplaned and reboarded multiple times due to delays. Despite the replacement, the forward lav door again failed during the flight, with the broken screw reinstalled. Maintenance ultimately installed a new door, but it did not fit properly, causing metal-on-metal contact and difficulty in operation. The Flight Attendant expressed strong concerns about the Foreman's dishonesty and unsafe practices, which could have led to a potential accident. The incident resulted in a 4-hour and 16-minute delay. The Flight Attendant emphasized the need for accurate maintenance signoffs, honesty, and thoroughness to prevent such incidents in the future. The aircraft was eventually cleared for flight after the issues were addressed.",crew-related issues

A paramedic and a nurse are assisting an ill passenger in seat 19b. Paramedics are waiting at destination. No ATC [notification was made].We see a small; individual cell ahead on radar: about 4 miles wide with light green rain indication and small amber center. We receive deviation clearance to the left from Control. We change course and continue descent. Visibility zero. When abeam of the cell on our right side; we flew through some imbedded cumulus and a short burst of rain. We received a quick; sudden jolt of moderate turbulence.I called back to the cabin via intercom to check with the cabin crew. I apologized about the event with no warning from us. I was assured that everything was okay although FA C sounded a bit unhappy about the event.We landed and arrived at the gate at [destination] with paramedics waiting to examine the ill passenger. A lot of confusion at the gate after the passengers deplaned with an army of cleaners coming aboard to 'turn' the aircraft. I saw FA A was moving aft to speak to FAs C and B while the cleaners and ground supervisors were on the airplane between us. The paramedics had left the jetway with the ill passenger. It was going to be difficult to wade through the cleaners to speak to my crew who were scheduled to fly the aircraft back to [origin]. Not having heard from them while at the gate; [First Officer] and I assumed our cabin crew were okay. We exited the aircraft to start our overnight.24 hours later; [First Officer] and I arrived at the aircraft for the northbound flight to [origin]. FA C and FA B were present and met us. It was then when we heard that they had sustained injury during the previous day while standing in the rear galley from the moderate turbulence jolt event. Both crew members complained of back and shoulder strain. In addition; FA C had sustained a small cut on her hand while grabbing a hand hold to steady herself.The event occurred because I failed to warn the cabin crew of possible moderate turbulence during descent. So; the crew was completing normal duties when the unexpected turbulence occurred. As is well known; turbulence effects are magnified when in the aft section of aircraft and also there was no warning of small bumps before the big jolt took place.I need to communicate better with my cabin crew during flight to warn them about turbulence ahead and also at the gate after such an event (by intercom; if necessary); to make sure that they are okay. I am not happy about my lack of knowledge about my cabin crew condition as I left the aircraft. One of my roles is to make sure they are okay and to assist them if they are not okay.,,,,A319 Captain reported learning the next day that Flight Attendants had been injured during an inbound turbulence encounter.,"An incident occurred during the descent of a flight, 100 miles north of the destination, where the flight crew encountered embedded thunderstorms with zero visibility. The flight crew deviated around a small thunderstorm cell, resulting in a sudden jolt of moderate turbulence. The cabin crew, including flight attendants B and C, were in the rear galley and were injured during the turbulence, sustaining back and shoulder strains, with FA C also receiving a minor hand injury. The incident was primarily due to the captain's failure to warn the cabin crew about the impending moderate turbulence, particularly considering the increased turbulence effects in the aft section of the aircraft. The flight crew descended through solid cirrus clouds, encountering light turbulence and using weather radar. Encountered a thunderstorm cell, leading to deviation and moderate turbulence. Cabin crew, assisting an ill passenger, were injured during the turbulence. Post-incident confusion at the gate hindered immediate communication with the cabin crew. The cabin crew sustained injuries, and the captain realized the need for improved communication regarding turbulence warnings and post-incident checks. Enhance communication with the cabin crew about upcoming turbulence and use the intercom to ensure their well-being after such events. The incident highlights the importance of timely warnings and effective communication to ensure the safety and well-being of the cabin crew during turbulent conditions.",crew-related issues

After arrival and shutdown at ZZZZ, the flight crew, including the designated operator (the flight attendant) and an observer (the captain), went to the courier area to disarm the entry doors. During the process, the captain noticed the L1 door arming panel handle was already in the disarmed position (green). The flight attendant attempted to arm the door by positioning the handle to armed (red), but the captain intervened, instructing her to return it to the disarmed position. The flight attendant then verified the girt bar flags were out of view. The right side door was also found disarmed, and the captain confirmed both doors were disarmed, announcing ""doors clear."" No further incident occurred after the flight attendant cracked open the L1 door. The cause of the incident was attributed to last-minute departure route changes just prior to departure, which led the flight attendant to not arm the doors and the captain to overlook the manual memo message regarding the doors. The crew agreed that fatigue and distractions could have contributed to the situation. The proposed solution was to ensure a more thorough review of EICAS messages to prevent similar incidents.",crew-related issues

The gate agents stated that I could not go down to the plane because the security search was being done. I then asked when did that start and the 3 gate agents looked at me as if I was speaking in a foreign language. At XX:18 the gate agent let down my First Officer and said I still could not go down while the security search was being conducted so I then called crew scheduling to notify them as to what is going on. After hanging up the phone one of the gate agents then says to me not every aircraft get a security search. I tell her I'm very well aware that first flights of the day as well as aircrafts that were in a non-secure area receive security searches. I work this same flight serval times a month and no one has ever told me I could not be on the plane while a security search was being done. They then call someone on the phone and a fourth person comes over. They walk me down the jet bridge to 'check' and see if the security search was finished and it is now XX:25; I'm still being denied access to the aircraft. I see the time and state we will not be boarding on time. The male says excuse me and I repeated we will not be boarding on time. He says boarding is 25 mins prior to departure so I tell him my report time is XX:15 not XX:25 I have first flight of the day duties that I need to do and have a report time for a reason. You have denied me access to the aircraft at the time I was supposed to be so we will not be boarding until I'm ready and that's when I was granted access to the plane. As I'm conducting my pre-flight Captain comes and asked me if I was ready and I said no! I literally just got on the plane they are not going to rush me. When I walk back to the front of the plane there are several more people standing on the jet bridge as if they were trying to intimidate me. After the [allotted time] was up for me to charge the floor path lighting I told them I was ready. After the gate agent hands me the paper work she asked could she pull the jet bridge and I tell her no. I make my announcements and conduct the cabin count. When I return to the front to give the Captain the count; there is a slew of gate agents on the jet bridge staring me down.If not being allowed access to the aircraft during a security search is indeed procedure; it needs to be followed daily and not just a random day out of the blue.

The flight attendant questioned the procedure, as they were unfamiliar with being restricted from boarding during the search. After several attempts to resolve the issue, including contacting crew scheduling and being transferred to a fourth person, the flight attendant was eventually granted access to the aircraft after a 10-minute delay. The delay caused the boarding process to be pushed back, and the flight attendant expressed concerns about the inconsistency in applying the security procedure to crew members. The incident was resolved when the flight attendant was finally allowed on the plane, completing their pre-flight preparations and boarding duties. The flight attendant suggested that if such procedures are standard, they should be consistently applied to all crew members.",crew-related issues

He asked me to close the cockpit door. As I was trying to close the cockpit door with no success; I continued to try 2 more times; when the Captain shouted angrily! 'Don't slam the damn door.' He repeated it several times; while slamming his hand on the Yoke! 'Don't you ever slam that door again; I'm sick of flight attendants slamming this door.' This was clearly a loss of temper heard by other crewmembers. I stood in fright and shock. After a moment; I told him his outburst was unacceptable and unprofessional for my attempts to close the door. It was then that First Officer explained how the door could be closed. He realized that the door closing mechanism switch (red toggle switch) was not engaged and was preventing me from shutting the door. The door was finally closed; and we departed. There are other events that gave me serious concerns about Captain [name removed].During the flight; the Captain asked for a bathroom break. I was terrified of being alone with him; so I asked another Flight Attendant to stay with me while I stood by the cart barricade. When he came out of the cockpit; he tried to intimidate me by staring me down; I ignored him. When he was finished using the lavatory; Flight Attendant [name removed] and myself noticed Captain fumbling with the keypad on the cockpit door; after several attempts; we were concerned. Flight Attendant [name removed] told him not to press so many numbers; as it would lock him out. He clearly did not know the door code; Flight Attendant [name removed] told him the door code.Captain [name removed] made it clear to us that he did not want us to use the door key pad; he wanted us to call the cockpit whenever we are to enter the cockpit. This is not in the Standard Operating procedures for flight attendants.During his briefing; he told us that while he's taxiing and if a passenger goes to the lavatory; he doesn't want us to call him; because he does not consider these events 'important or an emergency.'I am reporting this event as a 'Hostile Workplace Environment Incident' and that the matter be forwarded to the proper administrative forum. I make no personal request or recommendation for resolution as there should be standard procedure for handling 'Hostile Workplace Incidents.',,,,Flight Attendant reported a negative interaction with the Captain.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant (Party 1) and the Captain (Party 2) of the flight crew. During the pre-flight preparation, the Flight Attendant attempted to close the cockpit door but was unsuccessful. The Captain became visibly angry, repeatedly shouting at the Flight Attendant not to slam the door, which was witnessed by other crew members. After the Flight Attendant expressed concerns about the Captain's outburst, the First Officer intervened and explained that the door closing mechanism switch was not engaged, preventing the door from closing. The issue was resolved after the door was successfully closed. During the flight, the Captain requested a bathroom break, and the Flight Attendant expressed fear of being alone with him, asking another Flight Attendant to stay nearby. The Captain reportedly attempted to intimidate the Flight Attendant after using the restroom and appeared confused while trying to input the cockpit door code. The Flight Attendant intervened and provided the code, noting that the Captain did not know it. The Captain also instructed the crew not to use the door keypad, which is not in line with standard operating procedures. The Flight Attendant reported the incident as a ""Hostile Workplace Environment Incident,"" citing the Captain's unprofessional behavior, including his disregard for safety protocols and intimidating actions.

Captain failed to warn us of documented turbulence enroute [to] Oakland; failed to keep us seated throughout the flight; and Captain failed to keep us as safe as reasonably possible while performing our inflight responsibilities.Turbulence was both moderate and severe and lasted from the time we began drink service which we were unable to finish past one tray to the time we landed. It is inconceivable how the duration and severity of turbulence would not have been known to the Captain prior to flight. This is a heavily traveled route by both commercial and non-commercial air traffic and it is my understanding that turbulence of this nature should be included in the turbulence plots and weather briefings the Captain is required to obtain and share with his crew prior to departure.Secondly; were there no PIREPs indicating how severe and lengthy the frequency of turbulence was that evening? This is not the only time this has happened. In fact it occurs at [airline] every day practically. Captains in general almost never brief us on weather and when we ask if it will be okay to get up at 10;000 feet to begin service on short flights we are usually told yes. Then; we are bumped and rocked all over the place and never told to sit down until we are in the bad turbulence or the turbulence event has already occurred. We are not being given the weather briefings we deserve prior to flight and Captains are repeatedly not briefing us at all thus compromising our safety.In this particular instance; I woke up this morning with an aching back from the twisting and turning and jarring of my body during the turbulence. The Captain only communicated with us once the event was in full occurrence telling us to take our seats and to remain seated. We were not able to conduct any service beyond the one tray of drinks we in the back were able to distribute. The galley was a mess with spilled drinks everywhere and we were being thrown violently as we attempted to secure the galley.We were unable to collect garbage or secure the cabin for arrival due to the severity and duration of this event. Customers who purchased cocktails from me were never refunded their money because there was no way to do so safely. I ask why it is that the PIREPs of severe turbulence were not communicated to us by the Captain (as is all too often the norm); and why no preflight briefing was conducted by the Captain (also the norm at [airline]) . I also ask why it is we are required to serve drinks on very short flights and how that is considered safe. Some of our flights are barely 50 or 55 minutes block to block. We can't get up until 10;000 feet and must 1. Take drink orders 2. Pour the drinks 3. Balance trays with drinks on them and distribute them; then offer a snack service; conduct trash cleanup; offer seconds on drinks; again do a round of trash; and in addition restock the galleys on many flights. How is this safe?If you do the math the actual time we have to do all this is approximately 20 to 25 minutes and we are not allowed to simply do a water service. It appears safety of flight attendants is not a concern at [airline] as demonstrated by the overall lack of concern and failure of cockpit crews to brief us on matters paramount to our safety and managements disinterest in hearing how unsafe doing a full beverage service is on our shortest flights. When will you; the FAA; step up to the plate and hold our pilots responsible when they do not brief us even when there is an abundance of information available to us and when will you hold Management responsible for their unwillingness to deviate from unsafe practices?,,,,Flight Attendant reported not being informed in a timely manner or at crew briefing about turbulence reported along the flight path.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and the flight crew (Party2) regarding safety practices and communication during a flight. The flight attendant reported that the captain failed to conduct a pre-flight weather briefing or general briefing, did not warn the crew about documented turbulence along the route to Oakland, and allowed the flight attendants to move about the cabin despite severe turbulence. The turbulence, which lasted from the start of drink service to landing, was described as both moderate and severe, with the flight attendant experiencing physical strain and being unable to complete their duties safely. The flight attendant also criticized the lack of timely communication from the captain and questioned the safety practices, such as requiring full beverage service on short flights, which they argued compromised their safety. The flight attendant raised concerns about the captain's failure to brief the crew on known turbulence, the absence of pre-flight briefings, and the systemic issues within the airline, including the lack of action from management and the FAA to address these practices. The flight attendant requested that the FAA hold the captain and management accountable for these unsafe practices and ensure safer working conditions for flight attendants. In summary, the incident stemmed from a failure to provide timely and adequate safety briefings, leading to a hazardous work environment for the flight attendant and highlighting broader safety concerns within the airline.",crew-related issues

My working position on the aircraft required me to work the top of the meal cart and then spin to assist with the bar cart drinks. When I got far enough down the aircraft with the meals; I left Flight Attendant Y to finish distributing the meals and I then walked up the aisle to assist Flight Attendant X with the bar cart and drinks. I did not even have a chance to get my hands on the bar cart when he carelessly and quickly pushed it down the aisle towards me and struck an arm rest spilling both coffee and tea carafes all over one passenger. Flight Attendant X's hands never left the bar cart. I lunged to try to catch the carafes as they fell; but was unable to help. I immediately apologized to the passenger several times; all while trying to hold the hot soaked part of his sweater on his shoulder away from his skin; trying to pick up the carafes while Flight Attendant X is still shoving the cart onto me. I got up and thought he was assisting the passenger further but no he did not. He continued to push the cart down the aisle and continue service. I twisted my left knee when lunging for the hot carafes. I still thought that Flight Attendant X was attending to the passenger while I was pinned on the other side of the cart. I told him that he needed to slow down three times because he hurt me and the passenger. While in pain; I continued with the service. I had done my best to squat down to the bottom bin and grab a beer for a passenger; just before I stood up Flight Attendant X pushed the cart forward and I struck my forehead and nose on the tray on the cart. He sarcastically stated; 'Oh there you are!' I don't understand why he would push the cart forward when he saw me there. He saw me reach for the beer. I have a bruise on my nose and it hurts when I wear my prescription glasses. Flight Attendant X was aggressive verbally with the passengers and the entire crew but specifically honed in on myself and purser; Flight Attendant Z. We were the only women working the flight. He consistently undermined Flight Attendant Z by disobeying her authority. We had turbulence and Flight Attendant Z; after checking with the pilots on the situation; decided that it was not safe to bring the carts into the aisle. Flight Attendant X specifically ignored Flight Attendant Z's orders and took the cart into the aisle to serve while the remaining flight attendants used pick up pans to distribute drinks.  Flight Attendant X caused an unsafe; and uncomfortable work environment. How am I to react when I learned that he had stated to Flight Attendant A that he was going to 'xx Me Up!' I was afraid to be anywhere near him at this point and did not know what to do. I was afraid to talk to him because I did not want to inflate this situation. I have never worked in an environment where I have feared for my safety.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being in an unsafe situation and injured by another Flight Attendant's actions.,"The incident involved two flight attendants, Party1 (Flight Attendant X) and Party2 (Flight Attendant Y). Flight Attendant X was described as acting unprofessionally, recklessly, and aggressively while handling the bar cart. During service, X carelessly pushed the bar cart down the aisle, striking an armrest and spilling hot beverages on a passenger. Flight Attendant Y attempted to assist but was injured when she lunged to catch the falling carafes, twisting her left knee. Despite Y's injuries, she continued to apologize to the affected passenger and attempt to clean the spill. Y also reported being struck in the forehead and nose by the bar cart when X pushed it forward as she was trying to assist another passenger. Flight Attendant X was noted to have disregarded safety protocols, including ignoring Flight Attendant Z's orders to avoid bringing carts into the aisle during turbulence. Instead, X continued to push the cart into the aisle while other flight attendants used pickup pans. Additionally, X was described as verbally aggressive with passengers and the crew, specifically targeting Y and Flight Attendant Z, and undermining Z's authority. The situation created an unsafe and uncomfortable work environment. Flight Attendant Y reported feeling unsafe and feared for her safety after X made a threatening statement, stating he would ""xxx her up,"" which left her feeling afraid and unsure of how to proceed. The result of the incident was a hostile work environment, physical injuries to Flight Attendant Y, and emotional distress.

First passenger was seated in 8C with cabin pet in carryon kennel. Second passenger was 25A with small dog tucked under her coat. First Animal; [seat] 8: [The] dog remained in kennel for entire flight and did not cause disruptions. However; what caught my attention during boarding was passenger had to swap seats (at my recommendation) with 9D due to 8C's kennel unable to fit under her seat. The kennel was blocked due to the IFE power box under 8C. It should also be noted that PETC [Pet in Cabin] was not discovered as undocumented until inflight; thus ZZZ ground staff was not alerted about this animal prior to departure.Second animal [seat] 25A: Requested [passenger's] seat number as she boarded since I had not noted no pets on the Special Services List during preflight briefing. As boarding continued; I refreshed my Flight Attendant tablet to check if passengers with dogs were a last minute add to the manifest. However [passenger] was checked-in but no reference to ESA or SVAN [Emotional Support Animals and Service] on The Tablet seat map. Also; [I] referenced a fresh copy of the Special Services list no documentation.  I then contacted the female gate agent via phone and advised that we had a passenger with an undocumented cabin pet aboard while providing seat assignment. Prior to door closure; I witnessed [customer service representative] come onboard and question [the passenger].  I overheard him asked what type of service passenger's animal provided. The passenger responded; but I was unable to hear her answer. Later noted after landing that passenger's PNR had been updated reflecting her dog was a medic alert animal -- thus making it a SVAN. However; the dog had no exterior badging; vest; harness; or leash to keep the animal under control during the flight. The passenger simply cradled the dog in her arms during the flight.  As noted in the FA Inflight Manual; SVAN are to remain on leash or harness under passengers control at all times for safety.The main focus of this report is to express extreme concern on how two animals: 1 PETC and 1 SVAN were permitted to board the flight completely undetected by the ZZZ ground staff. Of even greater concern; PETC was in cabin kennel during the boarding process thus clearly visible to agents working the flight. Further; SVAN was permitted in the cabin without the correct restraint thus creating an injury risk to passengers and crew.Report filed due to personal safety/injury risk to passengers/crew with dog permitted to board without proper restraint requirements (leash/harness/vest). It also appears this animal was not correctly documented as a SVAN due to last minute add to PNR.,,,,B737-800 Flight Attendant reported 2 dogs being brought onboard without proper paperwork or notification from the gate agent.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party 1) and ground personnel (Party 2) regarding two passengers boarding a B737-800 aircraft with dogs that were not properly documented or restrained. During boarding, the flight attendant observed a passenger in seat 8C with a pet in a carry-on kennel and another passenger in seat 25A with a small dog under her coat. The first dog remained in the kennel for the entire flight without causing disruptions, but the passenger had to swap seats due to the kennel being blocked by an IFE power box under seat 8C. The second dog, later identified as an emotional support animal (ESA), was not documented as such on the passenger's manifest or special services list. Although the passenger was checked in, there was no reference to the ESA or service animal (SVAN) on the flight attendant's tablet or the special services list. The flight attendant notified the gate agent about the undocumented ESA and observed a customer service representative boarding the aircraft to inquire about the animal. After the flight, it was discovered that the passenger's PNR had been updated to reflect the dog as a SVAN, but the animal was not properly restrained, as required by safety protocols, and lacked any visible identification or control gear. The flight attendant expressed concern over the lack of proper documentation and restraint, which posed a safety risk to passengers and crew. The report was filed to address the safety risk associated with the un restrained animal and the failure to properly document the ESA. The flight attendant recommended improving communication and compliance with documentation and restraint requirements to prevent similar incidents in the future.",crew-related issues

The OPS agent came to finish up and I asked him what was going on with this passenger. I was told he was okay; they couldn't smell alcohol on him. He was probably tired from being out with business friends during the night. I voiced my concern of his wobbling; and his very slow movements and drifting off. I was told he was fine. The door was closed. During takeoff; he was loud trying to engage passenger in 1-A who feigned sleep. During service; he continually got up for the forward galley restroom but could not find the door; even trying the cockpit door. I stayed in the galley unless he was sleeping during most of the entire flight for security reasons. The B and C flight attendants were made aware of the situation. He continued his lavatory routine many times. At one point; he was returning to his seat and I heard a thud. He had fallen into the bulkhead row and was picking himself getting back to his seat. I asked if he was ok and he at first didn't respond. I asked again and he mumbled yes. I went back to fwd galley and I turned; he was right there backing me up saying he went to the doctor and had taken codeine and I had no right to ask him anything. I explained that I wanted to be sure he had not injured himself with the fall. He returned to his seat. He then shouted that he wanted my name. I stepped to the aisle and stated [my name]. He wanted my last name which I said we do not give out [last names] but [Company] has that info and knows who is working. He was upset. I turned to my galley and he jumped up and came at me with his phone and snapped my picture. I immediately asked him to delete it. He returned to his seat saying NO. I calmly told him that he cannot take a crew members picture without permission and he needed to delete it or have ground personnel meet the plane when we land. He refused. So I clearly stated; you are making the choice to have someone meet the aircraft because you are refusing to delete the picture. He just sat mumbling. The C Flight Attendant had come forward at that time and saw most of this. She then went back to take care of the cabin. I did tell her I was going to inform the Captain and ask for ground assistance. I did call the Captain; however; at that time; they were being diverted due to runway issues in ZZZ so he told me he would get back to me. I stayed in the galley waiting for the Captain to call. I was cleaning up when this passenger; who had been mumbling and talking most of this time; came up at me again; backing me up saying I was going down the wrong path with him. I firmly told him to sit down. The Captain called and informed the crew of the diversion and ZZZ issues. He asked about the passenger situation. I quickly gave a summary and asked for ground assistance. We diverted to ZZZ1. On landing; this passenger jumped up to get his bags saying he was leaving. Ops met the plane and police were quickly there along with ground Supervisor. I gave a statement to police. We received witness names and numbers along with a statement from a passenger who witnessed this passenger in [departure airport] in the gate area. This was given to police.Stop allowing passengers that are clearly under the influence of something to board. I don't know what else to say. These passengers are allowed and enabled. There should be no arguement or debate. If someone is asking if you have been drinking or taking medication; then it's a pretty good bet your behavior brought attention to you. Flight crew DOES look out for these issues. Our FAR states we cannot let them onboard. WE do not! We bring attention to the OPS agent or Supervisor or; our Captains; and then we are continually told 'they are fine' or 'they will sleep' or 'this is the last flight out'. Someone has to stop allowing this. Deny boarding; and stopenabling this behavior. Alcohol related issues are one of the biggest conversations among crew. [The passengers] expect ENDLESS alcohol. Drugs are unseen and are hard to detect but just as dangerous; and then you mix the two. Something has to be done to stop allowing this without there being serious consequences to the passenger! This situation has shown me just how vulnerable we are. I could have been physically hurt. I was trapped by this man. For the entire flight; I was on the highest alert in my head. My anxiety level hit me after we landed back in base. I am still having anxiety each time I have to file a report. My passengers could have been hurt. My Captain was busy with a last minute flight diversion due to runway issues in ZZZ; and had to acknowledge this situation. This puts everyone in harm's way. This man should NEVER have been ALLOWED on this aircraft. One of the witness statements was that he observed this man in [departure airport] and was shocked he was allowed on the aircraft at the very last minute. 74 people were trapped at 35K with him. I am not Management; I do not get to have a say in how our passengers are handled. I only know I; my crew; and the rest of the passengers are put at risk for the sake of ONE individual.,,,,B737-700 Flight Attendant reported a passenger became enough of an issue that police met the aircraft at destination.,"An incident occurred on a B737-700 flight involving a disruptive passenger. The passenger boarded late, exhibited unusual behavior, and was observed struggling with his luggage and appearing fatigued. Despite concerns raised by the flight attendants about his instability, he was allowed to board. During the flight, the passenger displayed erratic behavior, including repeated attempts to locate restrooms and falling in the aisle. He became confrontational with a flight attendant, taking her photo and refusing to delete it, leading to a safety concern. The flight attendant informed the captain, who was managing a runway diversion. Upon landing, the passenger was met by police, and the flight attendant filed a report. A witness statement supported concerns about the passenger's behavior. The incident highlighted the need for stricter boarding procedures to identify and prevent passengers under the influence from flying, emphasizing the importance of denying boarding in such cases to ensure passenger and crew safety.",crew-related issues

We had not yet completed our emergency demonstration when we received the single hi-lo chime from the flight deck that we were being cleared for departure. I knew that our procedure in these short taxis was to do the oxygen demonstration after takeoff. However; the Captain had communicated to us that we were expecting turbulence after takeoff; and that he would call us when it was safe to get up. Because of this; I continued with the emergency PA. I then began my final walkthrough; as it was my understanding that this always needs to be done. I had always seen other A flight attendants complete our pre-takeoff procedures even after we had received the single chime. I had reached the back half of the cabin when we started to accelerate into our takeoff. I was able to quickly get into an open seat and fasten my seatbelt; was not hurt in any way; and I returned to my jumpseat when it was safe to do so. Passengers and my fellow flight attendants saw this happen. Our C Flight Attendant was still in my field of view at the front of the cabin after I took a seat; and she rushed to take her jumpseat after we began accelerating into our takeoff. I debated calling the pilots during cruise to let them know that this had happened; but I was shaken up and upset and decided against it. I did bring it up with him while we deplaned at our destination. He was apologetic; and we both agreed that more communication on both of our parts would have benefited. The crew was not told that we would have a short taxi; and I did not communicate with the pilots that we were not ready to take off after we had received the chime. In my experience; it has always seemed like standard operating procedure for the pilots to wait for the A flight attendant to make the 'cleared for departure' PA before initiating takeoff; and if it is not made; for a call to be made to see what was going on in the cabin. The Captain had told me that ATC chatter had interfered with his ability to hear us making our PAs; and he thought we had made the 'cleared for departure' PA. Our C Attendant did ultimately make it after we were already in the process of taking off; and I was in a passenger seat. I consulted my manual when I got home; and did see where it says to signal the flight deck with 2 chimes and inform the pilots that we had not yet finished our emergency demonstration. Then; finish the oxygen demonstration after take off but below 25;000 ft. Again; that was not an option in this case because it was communicated to us that turbulence was expected on our ascent. Then; the manual says to exercise discretion on conducting the final walk through. I had elected to start my walk through after we had received the single hi-lo chime because I was under the impression that the walk through was always required prior to takeoff; and I do not recall being trained to not do it in any circumstances. Again; I had always finished all surface movement procedures before making the 'cleared for departure' PA; and had seen other A flight attendants do the same; even after receiving a hi-lo chime. And; I had never seen a plane take off without a flight attendant making the 'cleared for departure' PA; which is what happened in this case. Ultimately; this was a learning experience that got me to become more familiar with the manual's details in an unfamiliar situation that I had not yet encountered. In the future; I will communicate with the pilots if we are not ready for departure when we receive a hi-lo chime; and determine what procedures should be completed prior to taking my seat for departure. In my case; it was probably something that needed to happen for me to learn. I did not recall learning to not complete my walk through if we had received a hi-lo chime from the flight deck. If one has never been in a situation like this; the manual's language to 'exercise discretion on conducting the final walk through' does not easily connect to areal world situation where that discretion should be applied. It never would have occurred to me that not 'exercising discretion' could result in me being caught in the middle of the cabin during takeoff. Now that I have referred to the relevant section of the manual after this experience; I am prepared to handle this situation correctly in the future; both through more communication with the flight deck as well as my 'discretion.',,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported not immediately seating after receiving pre-takeoff chime notification.,"The incident involved a miscommunication between the flight attendant and the flight crew. The flight attendant, following standard procedures, began the final walkthrough after receiving the pre-takeoff chime, unaware that the Captain had been unable to hear their safety announcement due to ATC interference. As a result, the flight attendant found themselves in the cabin during takeoff, necessitating them to sit in a passenger seat temporarily. Post-incident, the flight attendant and Captain agreed on the need for improved communication and adherence to procedures. The flight attendant committed to enhancing communication with the flight deck and following manual guidelines more diligently in future situations.",crew-related issues

When the flight deck shuts down the aircraft while we are still deplaning passengers and leaves for their layover; it leaves the cabin crew in an unsafe position due to the inability for us to use the cabin inter phone or PA in the event of any type of emergency in the aft section of the aircraft. In essence; we have no way to communicate with the front of the aircraft other than use of the megaphone. In addition; the cabin temperature rises rapidly once the air flow is discontinued making it a health/safety issue for the 100 or more passengers still waiting to deplane.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft was shut down; on multiple occasions; prior to deplaning all the passengers.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant (Party1) and the Flight Crew/Ground Personnel (Party2) regarding the shutdown of a B737 aircraft during layovers. The Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft was shut down on multiple occasions before all passengers had deplaned, resulting in the cabin crew losing communication capabilities (interphone and PA systems), leaving them reliant on a megaphone. Additionally, the cabin temperature rose rapidly due to the cessation of airflow, posing a health and safety risk to passengers still on board. The Flight Attendant suggested that the aircraft should not be shut down until all passengers have deplaned to address these safety concerns.",crew-related issues

Subsequently the slide pack dislodged fell part way from door. I grabbed the door to stop further deployment and told agent to back away. I then called captain and told him of situation. He instructed me to get everyone away for safety and came out to assist. He took over my place holding the door and had station personnel call for maintenance. He calmly let passengers know what was happening and remained at door until slide pack was removed to a safe distance and we could deplane passengers.Background of the day and offered as an explanation and not as an excuse; for the fault lies with myself.Several things happened that day to not only distract my focus but also to degrade my physical condition and awareness which led to my subsequent failure.On [a flight] earlier that same day when responding to someone hitting their flight attendant call light repeatedly while I was seated I stood up from jump seat to see what was required. They had turned it off by then and when I went to sit back down in my jump seat it had returned to its spring loaded upright position and instead of sitting in my jump seat I fell to the floor. The rest of the day was filled with discomfort as a result. I tried to fill out an incident report immediately however I was made to understand from the company website that I would need to use an actual computer as the reports were not supported by my handheld device. Dwelling on that and actively trying to physically avoid my number three as he was not feeling well and I didn't want to come down with something as I was already starting to feel unwell. The last few days had included many days of long flight hours and between the physical and mental strain of that and the stress of starting to get sick; I initiated actions that led to the incident.Specifically at the time of the incident I initiated all call procedures to disarm doors and deplane passengers. The flight attendants 2; 3; and 4 all accomplished their disarming per policy. At this time I also realized that the carts needed sealing with blue liquor seals.My door however was still armed. At that point; my number 3 flight attendant pointed to my door and in an attempt to shake me from my non focused state firmly said; 'you need to disarm your door.' I acknowledged him; turned towards my door and immediately gave the thumbs up for the station agent to open door 1L even though it was in the armed position.Between all the issues fighting for my focus at that time; I did not personally use the appropriate disarming procedures including monitor and challenge on my door even after I had crosschecked door 1R.I obviously did not have my focus where it belonged. I was hurting; trying to keep from getting more sick and feeling the effects of fatigue after several long flight hour days. While all of these things are true; the door was opened and slide fell out because I incorrectly initiated the process.I understand the importance of monitor and challenge procedures and I let my pain; distraction and illness take away my focus. The reality of the situation and the danger I put the station agent in is a big reality check that I will not soon forget. My job; when opening or closing a door always involves the monitor and challenge procedures and I intent to always make sure to using them completely to always succeed in my job when opening and closing aircraft doors.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported that the entry door slide was not disarmed when customer service attempted to open the door.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and ground personnel (Party2) during aircraft operations. The flight attendant opened the 1L door of a 737 aircraft in the armed position after receiving a thumbs-up signal from the station agent. This caused the slide pack to dislodge and partially deploy. The flight attendant immediately grabbed the door to prevent further deployment, instructed the agent to step back, and informed the captain. The captain assumed control, ensuring passenger safety, communicating the situation to passengers, and coordinating with maintenance. The slide pack was eventually removed, and passengers were safely deplaned. The incident was attributed to the flight attendant's failure to follow proper disarm procedures, including the monitor and challenge protocol, due to physical and mental fatigue, discomfort, and distractions from prior incidents during the day. The flight attendant acknowledged the lapse in focus and expressed intent to adhere strictly to procedures in the future. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further complications.",crew-related issues

Additionally the passenger reported he saw smoke emanating from the overhead panel in the lavatory. Uncharacteristic of him simply smoking in the lavatory; but possibly something much more serious and potentially life-threatening; an actual aircraft fire. The smoke alarm was activated and projecting an extremely loud and piercing tone throughout the cabin. This caused distress among passengers as well as the FA's. Communicating with the FA's over the interphone was very difficult due to the combined chaotic nature of the alarm and the chaos surrounding its activation. The FA's were having difficulty extinguishing the alarm. I did not know if this was due to continued smoke; or some delay in extinguishing the alarm. Our collective belief was the situation could be much more serious. The FA's asked me for assistance in evaluating the situation. I knew my assistance in the aft of the aircraft would be a departure from our standard protocol. However; based on the information we received at the time; I concluded my assistance might very well mitigate a further degradation in the cabin and secure a safe condition as quickly as possible. The First Officer had demonstrated confidence and technical competence; thus I had no reason to doubt her ability to navigate and control the aircraft; as well as communicate with outside agencies while I assisted the FA's with what appeared and sounded to be a rapidly deteriorating situation. In the interest of time and consequently safety; I elected to personally inspect and evaluate the severity of the incident. I did this in order to determine the most expeditious course of action regarding continuing to [our destination] or turning back.As we were mere minutes from the critical point on our flight plan there was only one FA present in the forward part of the aircraft during the time I exited the flight deck. I shut the flight deck door before the forward FA could enter the flight deck. After working with the FA's to silence the alarm and after inspecting the lavatory and it's overhead panel; I determined there was no immediate threat of an actual aircraft fire; as there was no evidence of heat; burning; or residual smoke. I instructed the FA's to lock the lavatory; and reassess every few minutes. After I returned to the front of the aircraft; I established communication with the First Officer via interphone; and advised her I was ready to return to the flight deck; (after approximately 4-5 minutes). The smoke did not continue; so I opted to continue to [our destination]; as long as the condition didn't reappear. For reasons unknown to me; the First Officer left her seat to open the door rather than pushing the unlock button. About twenty minutes later; the FA's found an electronic cigarette in the toilet that was discarded in what appears to be an attempt to conceal its presence and cause for the smoke. After the passenger (who reported the smoke emanating from the overhead portion of the lavatory) was asked about the device; he did admit it was the cause for the smoke and activation of the smoke detector. I felt in the interest of safety; it was best to leave the flight deck and assess the situation personally; and that would be the most expeditious way to evaluate an overall course of action.At no time during the above events did I intentionally disregard standard procedure; rather I utilized my authority as the Captain to bring the situation to safe conclusion while being mindful of [Company policies].,,,,B737 Captain reported leaving the flight deck to evaluate smoke in the aft lav caused by a passenger's electronic cigarette.,"The incident involved a B737 flight crew responding to smoke in the aft lavatory, which was traced to a passenger's electronic cigarette. Upon notification, the smoke alarm activated, causing cabin chaos. The captain, departing from standard protocol, left the flight deck to personally assess the situation, concluding no immediate fire hazard existed. After extinguishing the alarm and inspecting the lavatory, the captain instructed the flight attendants to lock the lavatory and monitor the situation. Despite the First Officer's departure from standard procedure by opening the flight deck door, the captain returned and decided to continue the flight to the destination. Later, the flight attendants found the electronic cigarette, confirming its role in the incident. The captain's actions prioritized safety, aligning with company policies.",crew-related issues

FA (Flight Attendant) X was not in compliance the first day of work. [She] was eating out of first class basket before anyone was served; not briefing the exit row before main cabin door was closed and texting once she finished her service. The second day; FA X was working first class. When we arrived in ZZZ with almost a four hours and a half sit; I arrived in the crew lounge and was watching TV. FA X came in shortly after me [while] I was watching TV and texting. I look up and FA X pulls the plug from the TV and I said to FA X why are you behaving like this?FA X said you are not watching TV and I said I was and did not appreciate her behavior and she said she would do again if I turn the TV back on and she did for a second time. This time ripped it out of the wall and I said to FA X you are being disrespectful and to not do that again. She left the room; came back at the same time another crew member came in the room. She had her phone so loud. FA Y said would you please turn your phone down. She said that the volume was on the lowest setting for her phone. FA Y offered FA X headphones. She said they would not work on her phone. The show FA X was watching was using profanity every other word and it was very loud. Any crew member who walked in immediately walked out and sat outside the crew room. FA Y and myself left the room. We both felt very uncomfortable with FA X's behavior. The crew room is supposed to be a place to rest and relax. I did not feel comfortable with FA X's behavior [and] called my manager and explained what had happened and to see if once we arrived [at our destination;] if another FA could take her place. The manager said I know you have high expectations and informed me this was a CRM [issue] and we needed to work things out. Requested at some point to send an email in regards to what happened. When we arrived in ZZZ1; it was late and I was very tired and had an early report the next day. Did not have time to do a report in regards to the CRM. Following our ZZZ sit; I arrived to the aircraft for our next trip to ZZZ1; FA X said we needed to make it through these next 2 days. She was not sure what came over her in the crew room. I agreed with FA X let's work together. We performed our safety demo and part of the demo was to wear the life vest and performed how to wear the vest. FA X would only hold the vest during our demo. After our demo; I mentioned she needs to wear it versus holding it. On the third day of our first leg; FA X was leaving bins half open and the closet door open. This happened more than 8 times and had requested to please make sure they are closed and locked. She would just look at me and walked away. The service cart was left unattended at the exit row. FA X left her service cart and walk to the front galley and called the flight deck. I saw the cart sitting in the aisle at row 12. We did have turbulence on and off during the flight. I walk back to the cart and checked with passengers for service. She was requesting [that] a passenger wanted to purchase Pringles. Prior to FA X making the call to the flight deck; FA X had touched the FA call button twice in a row and I held my index finger to say give me a minute with okay I will be there. I was in the middle of my service with first class.I was not comfortable and felt the safety on the aircraft for the passengers and myself was not safe and FA X would not comply with the safety of the aircraft. I had requested for a manager to meet the aircraft once we arrived at our destination due to the situation through ACARS.I was not sure what the reason was for her calling the flight deck. I spoke to the flight deck in regards to problems of safety in flight. FA X called the flight deck and said I was ignoring her and not helping her on requested items. I explained as before; I was serving first class and [I] would be there shortly. I said to the CA (Captain) [that]there was a communication problem and FA X was leaving bins opened and unlocked service cart left in the aisle at row 12. FA X walked up to [the] galley to call the flight deck and left the cart in the aisle. I requested the flight deck to please notify ACARS there was an issue with safety on board and FA X was not keeping the bins closed and locked; left her cart at the exit row and not talking to me. After FA X's service in the main cabin; she began texting on her phone for the remainder of the flight and would not respond to me.On arrival; two regional managers came to the aircraft to talk and discuss the issues. I had explained to FA X; once all passengers had left the aircraft; a manager would be coming to talk with us in regards to our flight. Before I could address the reason for the call; FA X started the conversation in regards to the incident in ZZZ crew room and made false accusations in regards to what happened to the point of making up things that did not occur. The main reason for the meeting was to discuss the safety issues. I explained the issues of FA X not listening to my request to please lock and close all bins and several occasions to please close the closet door after she opened it to remove an item. The manager asked if we both could work this flight together if not; and you choose not to; you will have a missed trip and a meeting with a manager. FA X said she was okay and I said I had a problem flying with FA X from inflight safety as well making false accusations that did not occur.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that the work environment was very stressful due to the cabin crew pairing.,"The incident involved two flight attendants, FA X and FA Y, on a flight operated by an air carrier. FA Y reported that the work environment became increasingly stressful due to FA X's non-compliant and disrespectful behavior. On the first day, FA X violated protocols by eating from the first-class basket before service, failing to brief the exit row, and texting after completing her duties. The following day, during a layover, FA X disrupted the crew lounge by unplugging the TV, leading to a confrontation. FA X's behavior in the crew room was deemed disrespectful and uncomfortable by other crew members, prompting FA Y to contact management and request a replacement. Despite management's suggestion to resolve the CRM issues, FA Y did not file a report due to fatigue. Subsequent days saw continued non-compliance from FA X, including failing to secure bins, leaving the service cart unattended, and making disruptive calls to the flight deck. During turbulence, FA X was observed texting and ignoring safety protocols, leading FA Y to inform the flight deck about safety concerns. Upon arrival, managers met with the crew, where FA X made false accusations. The managers facilitated a discussion, with both agreeing to continue working together, though FA Y expressed ongoing concerns about safety and false allegations. In summary, the incident stemmed from FA X's repeated non-compliance and disrespectful behavior, leading to a CRM breakdown. Management介入 aimed to address the issues, but FA Y's concerns about safety and accuracy highlighted the need for continued attention.",crew-related issues

We were about 3.5 hours from our destination. The Chief Purser called the cockpit and advised me that we had an elderly passenger; flying with her granddaughter; experiencing some confusion. She advised me that the passenger has a history of dementia and that her granddaughter had also advised her of that Ms. X was experiencing some confusion and anxiety. She has some difficulty seeing (was told that she was somewhat blind but could see light and some shapes); in addition Ms. X didn't speak English. We found someone to interpret; but Ms. X was unresponsive; uncooperative and was unable to understand what was going on. I was flying; so I had the last break; so I (the Captain) went back to see what assistance I could offer. I found Ms. X agitated and not responding to verbal commands. I was advised that she wanted to open the door and get out; she kept telling the interpreter that she wanted to see her daughter 'right now' (the daughter was waiting for Ms. X to connect to another flight; and was going to pick her up). I observed her trying to go for the door; and she became somewhat combative; in addition she began to 'chant' out loud. I talked to the Doctor and Nurse who had offered to help and asked their advice. It was decided that we would let her stand in the aisle way and try and tire herself out (she refused any liquids or medication). I requested an F/A to remain at the door. I didn't want to force her to sit down; and I didn't want to have to restrain her; due to her frail stature and age. I had requested the two pilots in the cockpit to contact Dispatch and advise them of the situation; and our desire to have medical meet the airplane. I discussed the option of diverting with the Doctor and the Nurse; they thought that she could be managed; and that they would keep an eye on her. I elected to continue the flight. I ordered the cabin lights to be turned on in the hope that she would feel a little more secure. I returned to my seat and tried to resume my break. A few minutes later I was advised that she was becoming agitated and aggressive again. I returned to the cabin and after a discussion with the Doctor and Nurse; I ordered her to be put in an aisle with three seats so that the Nurse could sit on one side and the interpreter could sit on the other and keep her secure. It should be noted that by this time she had become a little more familiar with them and was responding somewhat to their voices. She did not want to sit down; so we had to hold her hands down while we physically put her in the seat. This was done with the help of myself; the Doctor; the Nurse; her granddaughter and another F/A. We got her into the seat and buckled her in; while the Nurse and Translator positioned themselves on either side of her. Ms. X calmed down; but did experience a few more episodes of agitation and aggressive behavior. I again questioned them of their ability to keep her calm. If the situation continued; or got worse; I was going to divert and get her off the airplane. They assured me that they could handle her; and there was no further incident for the rest of the trip. When we arrived; the Paramedics were standing by and had to restrain her to get her out of the jet. We thanked all who were involved; and told them how much we appreciated their assistance and consideration. I elected not to call for a Security level 1 or 2; after discussing it with the crew. Ms. X was clearly confused and suffering from Dementia; I did not feel she was a threat to the flight; only to herself. Her agitation and aggressiveness appeared to be due to her confusion and fear; I witnessed no malice or desire for violence. Because of her advance age and frail stature; I saw no real or immediate threat. The event was one of medical nature; and not a security threat.,,,,B777 Captain reported a passenger with dementia and poor eyesight experienced confusion and anxiety on an international oceanic flight. A physician; nurse; and her granddaughter were able to calm her sufficiently to complete the flight successfully.,"The incident occurred on a B777 flight with an elderly passenger, Ms. X, who suffers from dementia and has limited vision. Due to her confusion and anxiety, Ms. X became agitated and unresponsive, expressing a desire to exit the aircraft. The cabin crew, including an interpreter, attempted to assist her, but she remained uncooperative. The Captain intervened, consulted with a physician and nurse on board, and decided to let her stand in the aisle to calm down. When her agitation worsened, the crew helped her sit down with medical assistance, and she was restrained upon landing by paramedics. The flight continued without diversion, as the medical team assured the Captain they could manage the situation.

She had deplaned to retrieve her uncle's medication from the security check point (located in main terminal). We departed; requiring a tram ride from main terminal; where security is located. I was completely unaware a passenger had deplaned during boarding--I was busy doing catering checks; prepping galley; loading ovens; pre-departure beverages; making PA's etc. FA3 was occupied hanging coats and serving the drinks. Boarding was going on this entire time. FA4 stated she believed FA3 and I were aware a PAX had deplaned because boarding was held up briefly for PAX to come forward through First Class to deplane. I was not aware of this; FA2 stated he thought the passenger was coming forward to give a bag to the agent for checking. He stated as the PAX rounded the closet with her bag he proceeded back down the aisle to perform his duties so did not actually see the PAX deplane. Apparently there was an agent at the door but I had zero awareness of any of these goings on. I was task saturated. FA4 states she told PAX to take her carryon baggage and tell the agent what she was doing. Upon my awareness of the incident I spoke to the remainder of her traveling party. My conversation with family confirmed [the] PAX had deplaned with carry on; she had checked luggage; she did not return to aircraft; she returned to main terminal security check point to retrieve [her uncle's] medication kit bag; and she did not make it back to the plane. Family had been in text contact with her and their main concern was how would she get out of ZZZ; what flight would she be on? When asked why they did not notify the cabin crew that PAX had not returned before we left the gate [the uncle] said essentially 'we knew the plane would wait anyway.' I said that may or may not be the case depending on where she was in the process; but we really needed to account for her; for security sake and for her sake and for your peace of mind. They were very kind and calm about the incident; their only concern was how/when [she] would get to [destination].I then briefed the Captain with all I knew of the incident. He was able to contact dispatch and confirm that the PAX was #1 on the Stand By list for [another] flight; with that flight showing 4 open seats at the time. I informed [the uncle]. They continued to text and make positive contact at various times; to include upon landing.Besides the obvious breach in procedure; potential security concerns; and anxiety for the family-the Captain and I became concerned about how many souls we actually had on board. At door close the agent first said 149. Then another agent came back down and said 151; but didn't explain how/why it changed. Then door closed. So now...with PAX deplaning and NOT returning...how many Souls On Board did we really have?In retrospect I recalled an agent stating something to the effect of all the passengers having made it 'except for that one.' I don't know if that is in reference to [the deplaning PAX] or another revenue passenger who didn't make the flight. A 'time-out' to ensure all FAs are aware of what is happening- especially FA1 who is ultimately responsible for ensuring procedure is properly followed. Boarding should have been stopped- FA4 should have escorted the PAX and handed her off to me; or directly to the agent who was standing by; but definitely brief me on the situation. Communication. Slow down. Be deliberate. I feel awful about this event- I feel bad for the family. I am terrified that I let this happen on my watch for the security implication of such an incident. Thankful it had an innocent outcome; but I realize how serious it could be. I have learned a great deal and will include this in my future preflight briefings with my crews. Also; if the plane had crashed...how many pairs of shoes ARE we looking for? That scares me too. I don't know as anyone really knows and am beyond thankful that did not happen. Ask the captain--I was shaken to the core about this for those very reasons and the implications therein. The responsibility weighs heavy and I accept it completely. I feel terrible for what happened and am thankful there were no worse outcomes than some worry and inconvenience for the family. Lesson learned. Thank you.,,,,An Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that she was notified by another Flight Attendant that a passenger did not return to the aircraft after she deplaned during boarding.,"An incident occurred during a flight operation involving two flight attendants (FA1 and FA4) and a passenger who deplaned during boarding but did not return to the aircraft. The passenger had left the aircraft to retrieve her uncle's medication from the security checkpoint in the main terminal. FA1 was unaware of the situation due to being occupied with pre-flight tasks, such as catering checks, galley preparation, and loading ovens. FA3, another flight attendant, believed the passenger was returning a bag to the agent and did not notice her deplaning. FA4 notified FA1 of the incident after the fact. FA1 informed the passenger's family, who confirmed that the passenger had not returned to the aircraft and was at the security checkpoint. The family expressed concern about how the passenger would reach her destination. FA1 briefed the captain, who confirmed that the passenger was on the standby list for another flight with available seats. Despite the resolution, the incident raised concerns about communication protocols, the number of souls on board, and potential security risks. The flight attendant expressed regret for the lapse in procedure and acknowledged the importance of clear communication and halting boarding to ensure all passengers were accounted for. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and adherence to safety protocols among the flight attendant team. The flight attendant committed to incorporating this lesson into future pre-flight briefings and emphasized the importance of ensuring passenger accountability for safety and security.",crew-related issues

We called the flight attendants and (in accordance with standard operating procedures) the FO stepped out of the cockpit and a FA came in; closing the cockpit door behind him. While the FO was in the lavatory; a female passenger came up to the forward galley. The FA informed her that she must use one of the lavatories in the back of the aircraft or return to her seat; but that she could not remain in the forward galley. The passenger was Hispanic and claimed not to understand the FA. Luckily; all three of the FAs spoke fluent Spanish and it was again explained in Spanish. The passenger still refused to move and she verbally abused and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA came up to assist. The 'A' FA called up to inform me what was going on. I could hear loud voices over the interphone and the FAs speaking to the passenger in Spanish. Meanwhile; the FO had exited the lavatory and was now also in the galley. After several more minutes; the passenger's husband came up and convinced her to return to her seat. After she was seated and with the three FAs plus the male deadheading FA guarding and blocking access to the forward galley and the cockpit door; the cockpit door was opened and the FA exited the cockpit and the FO entered. We then locked down the cockpit in accordance with a Threat Level 1. I contacted Dispatch with our status and requested to have law enforcement meet the aircraft in ZZZ. After arriving in ZZZ; law enforcement removed the passenger from the aircraft.After speaking with the FO over the interphone; and visually confirming the galley was secure; I determined that it was safer and more prudent to have the FO in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. This scenario needs to be addressed during recurrent security training. What is the safest course of action if the cockpit is locked down with one of the pilots in the cabin? If it is determined that keeping the cockpit on lockdown is the safest course; where should the FA sit? In the jumpseat or in a pilot seat?,The reporter stated that this encounter with a passenger was more of a misunderstanding; but it brought up the bigger issue of what to do if the threat is real. If a real threat was just outside the cockpit door with the first officer out of the cockpit with a single pilot and flight attendant in the cockpit; what is the proper procedure? Do you put the FA in the pilot's seat where they have access to the flight controls; but you can keep an eye on him/her? Do you put the FA in the jumpseat where you can't see them? The reporter mused 'could the FA be in on it'; what is really happening on the other side of the door? The reporter stated that he feels unprepared for which procedure should the pilot use for these type of scenarios. He feels more training should occur addressing these issues.,,,B737-800 Captain reported that a passenger refused to leave the forward galley while the First Officer was using the forward lavatory causing a security issue.,"The incident occurred during the cruise phase of a B737-800 flight about 45 minutes prior to landing at ZZZ. The First Officer (FO) required a physiological break and temporarily left the cockpit to use the forward lavatory. A flight attendant (FA) entered the cockpit in accordance with standard procedures, closing the door behind them. During the FO's absence, a Hispanic passenger approached the forward galley. The FA instructed the passenger to either use one of the rear lavatories or return to her seat, as she was not permitted to remain in the galley. The passenger, who did not understand English, was initially uncooperative. However, the three FAs, who spoke fluent Spanish, repeatedly explained the situation. Despite this, the passenger refused to comply, verbally abused, and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA was called to assist. The 'A' FA informed the Captain via interphone, who heard loud voices and ongoing dialogue between the FAs and the passenger in Spanish. The FO, having exited the lavatory, joined the situation in the galley. After several minutes, the passenger's husband intervened and persuaded her to return to her seat. With the passenger seated and the FAs, including the male deadheading FA, positioned to block access to the forward galley and cockpit door, the cockpit door was opened. The FA exited the cockpit, and the FO returned. The cockpit was then secured in accordance with Threat Level 1 protocols. Upon arrival at ZZZ, law enforcement was summoned to remove the passenger from the aircraft. The Captain, after consulting with the FO and visually confirming the galley's security, determined it was safer for the FO to remain in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. The incident highlighted the need for recurrent security training, particularly addressing scenarios where the cockpit is locked down with one pilot in the cabin. The discussion raised questions about the safest seating arrangement for an FA in such situations—whether in the jumpseat or a pilot seat.",crew-related issues

The signal for the cabin to disarm doors is the seatbelt sign going off. We waited about 45 seconds and they still hadn't started disarming doors. I cycled the seatbelt sign in case they hadn't heard it; still no disarming. As the jet way was quickly approaching the door we made a PA for the flight attendants to disarm doors. This is the same crew who didn't check handset the night before until we had done a [return to the gate] for another reason. The same 'A' that had no idea what a security check was or why we did it on first flight of day. Same flight attendant that had no idea why we wear O2 masks when one of us leaves the flight deck.Maybe we should train the new hires in more than 2 weeks so they learn what we used to teach all flight attendants in their class. This in just one example of the many things I see on a daily basis that hardly ever happened a few years ago The training of the new hire flight attendants is only hitting high spots now train them the way we used to so they actually learn something.,,,,An Airbus A320 Captain reported that after arrival the flight attendants did not disarm the doors in a timely manner.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding the delayed disarm of cabin doors after arrival. The flight attendant failed to disarm the doors promptly after the seatbelt sign was turned off, despite a 45-second wait and an attempt by the captain to cycle the seatbelt sign. When no action was taken, the captain made a passenger address (PA) announcement to urge the flight attendant to disarm the doors. This incident highlighted concerns about the flight attendant's knowledge and training, as they reportedly lacked understanding of basic procedures such as security checks and oxygen mask usage. The flight attendant in question was part of a new hire group that the captain criticized for inadequate training, suggesting that the training program may need to be revised to include more comprehensive instruction. The summary concludes with a call for improved training for new hires to address recurring issues.",crew-related issues

I was working in A position on the aircraft; a sold out flight with two jump seats occupied. A pre-boarding Customer was listed on my specials report as having a vision impairment and having a working assistance animal. I met the Customer in the jetbridge and offered my assistance; to which he refused. The Customer's service animal appeared to be a full sized golden lab.The Customer proceeded to sit in a bulkhead row aisle seat on this aircraft. I informed the Customer that he would need to sit in the window seat so that his service animal would not hinder the egress of Customers sitting outboard of him. The Customer informed me that he was not going to move to the window seat; that he knew his rights and that he had every right to sit in the aisle seat and that he didn't have to occupy the window seat if he didn't want too. He informed me that his dog was not going to be in the aisle and would not obstruct the aisle. I explained to him that the aisle was not my greatest concern; that the animal was in fact obstructing access to the aisle for the two yet to be occupied seats. The Customer still refused to move. Sensing that the customer was going to be difficult to deal with; I simply replied with; 'Ok' and continued with the boarding process.I pulled out my EFAM (Flight Attendant Manual) and conducted a search to make sure that I was in-line with [Company] policies and procedures. I also asked assistance from my B to help with the search so I could face my customers as they boarded the aircraft. Our search quickly found what we were looking for. [In the FAM] it stipulates that an assistance animal 'May not obstruct an aisle or access to an aisle.'  I informed a ramp agent in the jetbridge that I would need a representative to address the situation and they informed my Ops Agent. I informed my Captain of the situation.Boarding was complete and I still didn't have a representative. Ops Agent again called and Ops Supervisor came to assist. I explained the situation to Ops Sup and Captain and showed them the aforementioned FAM requirements for assistance animals. Captain reviewed the FAM for several minutes to ensure there was no grey area around the policies and procedures. We as a team; all 4 Flight Attendants; our Captain; our Ops Agent and our Ops Supervisor all found ourselves in agreement that the Customer with the assistance animal would need to sit in the window seat in order to meet our safety regulations. Ops Sup was tasked with engaging the Customer with the assistance animal and asking him to swap seats to the window seat. Ops Sup explained everything to the Customer and was rejected just as I was; but this time with all the seats full of Customers; Ops Sup found himself at the end of the stick. Customers who had no reason to be engaged in the conversation with Ops Sup found themselves yelling at Ops Sup; telling him that the disabled Customer had rights and that he didn't have to move if he didn't want too. Ops Sup left the aircraft and made a call to Customer Service to get their stance on the conflict. They backed the direction of the FAM and crew and directed Ops Sup to again ask the Customer with the assistance animal to move one last time or to remove him from the flight for non-compliance with safety regulations. Again; Ops Sup engaged the Customer and the Customer refused to move. He even said that he wasn't getting off the aircraft; period. With that Ops Sup was left with only one option; to call the police and have the Customer physical removed from the aircraft for his refusal to comply with the required safety regulations. After 10 minutes of waiting for the police; Ops Sup called the police again as they still hadn't shown up. The Customers in the row tried repeatedly to get the Customer with the assistance animal to move to the window seat but he refused. Everyonejust wanted to get the flight under way.After nearly 30 minutes the Customer with the assistance animal finally agreed to take the window seat; at the convincing of the Customers in his row. He was angry and told everyone that this was going to be their last day on the job. He stated that he wasn't going to leave the [arrival] airport until he had received justice for the injustices against him. The police never showed up. During the flight the Customer showed no aggression and other than using the forward lavatory three times; stayed in the window seat. He had a Jack and Coke which I comped. Upon arrival; the Ops Agent approached me regarding a known difficult Customer. I gave him the rundown of what happened so that he could alert his leadership team. The Customer and his supporters did in fact give the Customer Service and Ops team a difficult time in the gate area. Leadership informed the Customer that he needed to get in touch with Customer Service.Customers need to abide by the required safety regulations; including Customers with disabilities. Maybe the ACAA (Air Carrier Access Act) could assist the airlines and their members by informing their members of what they can do to avoid conflict on an aircraft and how follow the safety regulations that airlines must enforce. As for flight crews; everyone must be on the same page in enforcing the safety regulations. When one crew lets safety slide; the rest of us hear about it from the Customers.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported an encounter with a visually handicapped; dog-assisted passenger who refused a window seat thus failing to comply with company aisle obstruction regulations. The passenger voluntarily moved to a window seat after a threatened removal from the flight.,"The incident involved a visually impaired passenger with a service dog on a sold-out flight. The flight attendant requested the passenger to move to a window seat to prevent obstruction of aisle access, as per company policies. The passenger refused, citing his rights, leading to a prolonged delay as the crew and supervisors attempted to resolve the issue. The situation escalated when the police were threatened with being called, though they didn't arrive. Eventually, other passengers persuaded the man to move, allowing the flight to proceed. The passenger remained agitated but compliant. Post-landing, he caused a scene, prompting leadership to direct him to contact customer service. The flight attendant suggested that the ACAA could aid in educating passengers to prevent such conflicts, emphasizing the need for consistent enforcement of safety regulations.",crew-related issues

I made appropriate periodic PAs to Passengers. Our wheels up was :50 so I told Agent and Crew to plan to push at :40. At push time no one was ready. I had to go to the top of the jet way to find the Agent and there was no Pushback Crew. As a result we were rushed despite the 50 minute delay. At this point there was a serious chance that we would not make our wheels up time. At the last moment the A Flight Attendant tossed the napkin on to the console and closed the cockpit door. The last digit of the count was illegible and I made the mistake of assuming it was correct. As we approached the runway we were cleared for immediate takeoff. I rang the cabin to notify the Flight Attendants and as we took the runway the A called up to tell us that there was a Passenger that thought he might be on the wrong aircraft. I had the First Officer instruct everyone to remain seated and that we would sort it out in the air. Above 10;000 feet I confirmed the load sheet count of 46 and compared it to the napkin count of 4 (illegible). I contacted the A who said her count was 47. Further investigation revealed that our extra Passenger was a connect for [a different airport] that had failed to exit at the last stop and remained on the aircraft despite the numerous PAs referring to our destination. I suspect that he was in the lav during the through count process. We coordinated with Dispatch to have a [customer service agent] meet him.Slow down; it's always wise to slow down. Also; our procedure of verifying the count as the very last thing to occur before push; seems like there could be a better time to discover this showstopper; especially when faced with a potentially significant delay if an error is detected. Maybe I haven't been paying attention but I ride other airlines and I've never seen flight attendants actually count Passengers before pushback. The potential error chain has too many links with our system.,,[Report narrative contained no additional information.],,B737NG flight crew reported they departed with an unaccounted passenger onboard.,"The incident arose from a miscount of passengers during the boarding process, resulting in an unaccounted extra passenger on board. The flight experienced a 50-minute gate hold after boarding was complete. Despite periodic passenger announcements, the pushback was delayed due to unprepared staff and missing pushback crew. At pushback, the flight attendant provided an illegible passenger count, leading the captain to assume the count was correct. Takeoff was approved, and the cabin was notified. Shortly after taking the runway, the flight attendant reported a passenger concerned about being on the wrong aircraft. The captain instructed everyone to remain seated and planned to address the issue in flight. Upon reaching 10,000 feet, the load sheet showed 46 passengers, while the flight attendant's count was 47. The discrepancy revealed an extra passenger, a connecting passenger who had not exited at the previous stop, found in the lavatory during the count. The crew coordinated with dispatch to have a customer service agent meet the passenger at the destination. The flight had to divert to resolve the issue, causing delays and operational challenges. The extra passenger was offloaded, and the aircraft was prepared for the next leg. The captain suggested revising the passenger counting procedure, possibly conducting counts earlier or more thoroughly to prevent such errors, noting that other airlines may handle this process differently. This incident highlights the importance of accurate passenger counting and the potential benefits of revising current procedures to minimize errors.",crew-related issues

Shortly thereafter; the Flight Attendants notified us that the device and its spare batteries (which were also in a state of thermal runaway) were contained in the ion battery emergency containment bag and there was no smoke.The device was apparently an e-cigarette. As the device was contained and there was no smoke; I elected to discontinue the QRH. However; the flight deck crew remained on oxygen for the duration of the approach and landing. Approach and landing were uneventful. My biggest concern is that after attempting to notify the Flight Attendants that we were on oxygen; I never called them back. They were making announcements on my first attempt and I simply dropped calling them back off my to-do list.

The Captain instructed the purser to close the door, but she misunderstood and exited the cockpit. Meanwhile, a flight attendant tried to persuade the passenger to return to their seat. After the purser closed the cockpit door, the Captain contacted the First Officer (FO) via interphone. The FO unlocked the door, allowing the Captain and purser to re-enter the cockpit.

Still couldn't see the ground. I saw the ground; we were coming in fast; perhaps 100 feet? Rushed to my jumpseat and made it. Just before landing the lavatory door behind me opens and a passenger is there. I told him to stay in the lavatory for landing; because he couldn't get back to his seat before landing; hold onto the assist handle and brace himself. This was a  passenger sitting in 6C; according to my tablet. The landing was good; the passenger was OK. I called the Captain to ask him to stop for a minute so he could get back to his assigned seat; but the Captain didn't answer. We did stop for a while so I told him to return to his seat. 'The Flight Attendant told me I could use the bathroom;' he declared.  Wrong. I checked and none of us said he could - we were landing!The Captain called me back and I told him what had happened and what I had done. After deplaning; the Captain was very apologetic; telling me that Air Traffic Control had changed the runway on them THREE times. I passed on his apology to the crew. Oh; and I think I forgot to dump the coffee before we landed too.  If Air Traffic Control hadn't changed the runway three times; the Captain would have been able to notify us in a timely manner. But...stuff happens.,,,,A321 Flight Attendant reported not receiving the approach announcement from the Captain and only realizing how close to landing when hearing the gear extended. The cabin was not completely secured and a passenger was in the forward lavatory during the landing.,"The incident involved an A321 flight where the flight attendant (Party2) reported not receiving the approach announcement from the flight crew (Party1). This led to the cabin not being fully secured for landing. During the landing, a passenger was found in the forward lavatory, which is against safety protocols. The flight attendant instructed the passenger to stay in the lavatory and brace for landing. After touchdown, the passenger attempted to return to his seat but was initially prevented due to the Captain's unresponsiveness. The flight attendant informed the Captain of the situation, after which the aircraft stopped briefly, allowing the passenger to return to his seat. The Captain later apologized, citing that Air Traffic Control had changed the runway three times, which delayed the timely approach announcement.

You would think exit row passenger of all passenger would be willing and able to comply with crew instructions. This man should never be allowed to sit in an exit seat again! At the time of walk through his seatbelt was undone was under his feet in aisle and newspaper was under his feet. I requested he stow bag and laptop and fasten seatbelt and asked if newspaper was trash could I take it for him. He said no he was reading it so I asked him to remove it from floor in exit row so no one would get hurt if we actually had to use exit; then I continued down aisle. On passing him on my way back he still had not complied with one thing I said. I seriously thought about removing him from exit seat; but did not want to escalate situation. So I made the same request AGAIN. He told me he was keeping his laptop on his lap because he could. I was wrong. I then informed him that I was not wrong and that it was in my manual as such and I would be happy to show him. Finally he said I will put it away but you are wrong and then told to LEAVE HIM ALONE. I talked to the CA of the situation. CA told me to show him in magazine where it is required to stow laptops. I didn't because as I said it would have escalated. This sort of behavior is unacceptable in exit row passenger. This man was of course one of the airline's [high] mile passenger. It is a shame because they hold a status that we cannot do our jobs.

Customer mentioned that they already paid Business Class fare and since now is seated in Economy Class; I should not charge for the food. I politely ask for the full name and check my name list. Since the name was not on the list; I explained that I can't compliment a meal. Customer started to complain about how bad Customer Service is and will write me to the company if I charged for the food. I apologize for what happened in earlier flight but I did not have all the information and suggested that they can write feedback to the company online. Customer seems to be more agitated and refused to listen and continue verbal abuse to me; saying that will make a big case about this incident and make sure the social media get my name and the company will fire me. At this moment; I realize that the situation will escalate; so I decided to remove myself from the situation by saying 'Please enjoy your wrap for now and we can have this conversation after the service' and proceed to the next row. Customer now demanded a cheese plate. I told her that I can't compliment for this; and explained even for upgraded customer I can only compliment 1 food item and 1 alcoholic beverage. Customer harassed me again with words; and when I turn away; that's when they grabbed my arm and yanked my sleeve. I told the customer not to touch me. They let go of me and said 'You are very rude.

I attempted to go back to sleep but couldn't due to a galley cart that was parked in front of the door knocking against it every time the aircraft moved from the light turbulence we were experiencing. I got dressed and attempted to exit the bunk but couldn't because of the galley cart parked in front of the door. I waited for the cart to be moved and exited the bunk. The ISM (Inflight Service Manager)/purser and another flight attendant were in the galley. I told them to stop parking carts in front of the bunk door for two reasons; noise from the cart knocking on the door; and we couldn't get out of the bunk in the event of an emergency. [The] flight attendant immediately became argumentative with me. He asked me which manual prevented them from parking a cart in front of the bunk door. He said that it's a galley and that I should expect that kind of noise. He told me to use ear plugs. Here's the best one. He said it's a galley design flaw from Boeing. I gave up after that one. From his argumentative careless attitude towards my concern I was obviously wasting my time trying to fix the problem with this flight attendant. This is a constant issue.In conclusion; I believe that galley carts should not be parked in front of the pilot crew bunk door in the interest of safety. Galley carts banging on the door make sleep impossible and prevent us from exiting the bunk in the event of an emergency.,,,,B787 First Officer reported his rest was interrupted by noises from a galley cart that was parked next to the bunk room door.,"A conflict occurred between a member of the flight crew (Party1) and a flight attendant (Party2) regarding the placement of a galley cart near the pilot crew rest bunk door on a B787 aircraft. The incident was triggered when the flight crew member was unable to sleep due to noise caused by the galley cart colliding with the bunk door during turbulence. Additionally, the cart blocked the exit from the bunk room, raising safety concerns. The flight crew member addressed the issue with the Inflight Service Manager (ISM) and another flight attendant, requesting that galley carts not be parked in front of the bunk door. The flight attendant responded dismissively, challenging the validity of the concern and questioning the relevant procedures. Despite the crew member's efforts to resolve the issue, no agreement was reached, and the problem remained unresolved.

The Captain and I discussed returning to the gate; and decided if the passenger was still in the lav in 5 minutes; or if when they came out they were not feeling well; we'd return to the gate. After 2 minutes; the FA called and reported she was out and feeling better. We asked 'are you sure?' The FA said yes. We taxied; took off; and flew for an hour and 20 minutes without incident. At this time; they called to report our meals were ready. I asked about the ill passenger; and the FA told me there were 20-25 sick people in the back. Vomiting; diarrhea; etc. At this point; we knew we had an issue. We asked them for as much info as possible; if the people knew each other; stayed at the same resort; etc. It was then we learned people boarded the aircraft complaining of illness. This is the first time we heard any of this. I'm truly not trying to throw anyone under the bus; but it was frustrating to find out these details so late in the flight; where we are an hour from the nearest airport with few options. At this point; we requested direct [to destination] and tried to get a patch to MEDLINK. We were on the boundary of HF and VHF; so we never got a clear signal on the VHF frequency they gave us. The FAs came back that 3-4 passengers felt really sick; and the other 20 or so either felt off or had been sick in Puerto Plata. One had even been in the emergency room the night before in the Dominican Republic. Again; news to us. Most or all of the sick passengers stayed at the same resort.

The other crew was leaving in a timely manner. The cleaners were not off yet and the gate agent starts boarding while we are still standing in the jet bridge. We get on the plane and the cleaner would not move to let us put our bags away; mine were still in the FWD doorway blocking the door. I start to preflight without putting bags away and I mentioned to the gate agent; if she could please not board without our permission. The gate agent says in front of the line of passengers 'I'm trying to expedite the boarding process on such a short flight since you guys were late'. Our FO (First Officer) then said; 'you cannot board without our permission we have to make sure our safety procedures are done'. The gate agent mumbled to the passengers who could clearly see we were not ready and were very kind to us. After boarding while waiting for the bag slip the other FA (Flight Attendant) made a comment to the gate agent 'that it wasn't very nice to make a comment like that in front of passengers and if she could ask before boarding?' The response was 'good comment; I may take into consideration' and started laughing and walked away to talk with the other gate agent. She had paged us when we were right in front of her and she was aware of us; and started pushing the lady in the wheel chair right behind us as we entered the jet bridge and asked us if we were ready to board when we hadn't gotten on the plane yet.

When we got to the airport the van driver pulled me aside and told me I needed to do something about her (both that she seemed sick and she smelled sick) the other F/A and I were able to pull the captain aside and share our concerns and the van drivers comments; even telling him that she was not fit to fly. We shared the same concerns with the lead F/A when we got to the airplane. To my knowledge; neither of them spoke to her; and we began to board. We were rushed during the boarding process; even closing the door with bags in the cabin that needed to be checked.

I know we were in an out station; and removing her from the trip would have caused great delays and customer inconvenience; however; that is exactly what should have happened. An ill crew member is often not a very good judge of their own ability and we have an obligation to look out for each other and act in the best interest of our coworkers and passengers. I do not feel I had the tools to do so. We go to great lengths to outline procedures for ill pax; etc. but those were not applied here.

A lot of passengers in the cabin got up out of their seats. Took their luggage out of the overhead bins and used the lavatories. The bins were open the aisle was blocked by bags.

This resulted in blocked aisles and exits due to open overhead bins and loose luggage, creating safety concerns. The flight attendant addressed the issue by asking passengers to remain seated if unnecessary and keep luggage stowed, then informed the Captain of the potential risks. Despite the Captain's agreement, he later instructed passengers to return to their seats, and the attendant continued preparing for taxiing. During this time, the cabin was not properly secured, and the Captain's communication was deemed condescending and unprofessional, contributing to a potentially unsafe environment.

She is incoherent and mumbling.' I told the Lead Flight Attendant that I intended to call Medlink. She then said that we did not need to do that and she would let me know if things got worse. I repeated that I intended to call Medlink and asked her to find out her name; age and if she had taken any drugs or alcohol. I found the appropriate frequency for AIRINC and had them patch me through to dispatch. I then explained our situation to our dispatcher and requested a patch to Medlink. This communication was very broken. We were dropped a few times and dispatch and Medlink had a hard time understanding us. While I was talking to Medlink I called the Lead Flight Attendant back and attempted to get the information and requested she locate a Medlink checklist that past flight attendants have given to me. She said that the lady was now on oxygen and had taken a Motrin and a glass of wine and would be alright and I did not need to contact Medlink. I told her that I was already talking to them and requested the info I had requested earlier. She then stated that there was a language barrier and she could not understand the woman; but she was doing better. I again asked her if she could find out her name and age. The flight attendant then asked if I wanted her to rummage through the passengers belongings. I said no just do the best you can and ask her. She then said that the passenger just wanted to be left alone and was tired. I again asked her to do the best she could and find out the information that Medlink was requesting. She then said 'Here talk to Flight Attendant B' and would not coordinate with me anymore. This flight attendant gave me the seat number and estimated her age. He stated that the passenger was acting like she was really drunk and about to pass out. I asked him if he smelled alcohol on her and he replied no. I relayed this information to Medlink finally. The Medlink Dr. requested that we have the passenger lay on the floor with her feet up.Upon landing I asked our Lead Flight Attendant to debrief our flight with us as I felt that we had a communication breakdown. She said we did have a communication breakdown because she did not want me to call Medlink and I did anyway. I informed her that my calling of Medlink was not her decision to make and that getting the opinion of a trained doctor was the safest course to take as well as relieving us from liability for not seeking out medical help for a sick person. She stated that she has medical training as a flight attendant and that in the future she will not call the pilots until it is a dire emergency and she wanted us to call for help and we will just be out of the loop. I feel this is an unacceptable and dangerous attitude. Medlink is not just for dire emergencies and waiting until someone becomes very sick could have grave consequences for a sick passenger someday.,,,,B737 Captain was informed by the Lead Flight Attendant that a passenger is down in the aft galley; but it is not necessary to contact Medlink at this time.

Upon landing, the Captain addressed the communication issues, stressing the importance of consulting Medlink for safety and liability reasons. The Lead Flight Attendant responded by stating her medical training and intent to contact pilots only in emergencies, expressing upset over the situation.

The Flight Attendant misunderstood the FO's request to tell his son that they were passing near Greenland for him to take a look.   When I later went back for a washroom break just prior to the landing at ORD; I also talked with the Flight Attendant about his required procedures with the entry into the Cockpit and the Cockpit Door opening. Also reminded him if he ever felt that a request of that nature is what he heard; he best clarify and to just speak up and ask if that was what was asked of him.  Also knowing his responsibilities and training; to just refuse such a request. Had he just asked to clarify; or refused the request none of this would have happened.,,We were at cruise during the second portion of the scheduled pilot break. The Captain was on his break and myself and the relief FO were in the cockpit. As we were approaching Greenland; I called the forward galley to inform Flight Attendant that the weather ahead was nice with good visibility; since he had asked me earlier if we were going to be able to see Greenland. He asked if he could come up to the cockpit. I told him that would be fine; since this would give me an opportunity to take a lavatory break after he came to the cockpit. He said he would call back when the area was clear and he would be ready. The relief FO then called back to the forward flight attendant station and asked whoever it was that answered the phone if they would inform his son who was riding in the cabin that he look outside his window to see Greenland. Subsequently; the Flight Attendant called to say he was ready and would be at the door. I then went to the door and looked out the door viewing port. It was dark outside the door; but I could see his face as he was close to the door. I didn't see anyone else; as the son was much shorter. I then opened the door and stepped back. At that point; the son had already stepped in and the Flight Attendant was following him into the cockpit. As the door was closing behind them; I recalled our security training which emphasized keeping the door open as short a time as possible (three seconds ideally) and realized the safest thing to do was to close the door and sort it out with the cockpit secure. We then called back to confirm the area was still secure and arranged to have them exit the cockpit as quickly as possible. After discussing the error; it appears to have been a misunderstanding about bringing the boy to the cockpit versus pointing out the view.,,A B767 crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit in flight.,"The incident involved an unintended breach of cockpit security on a B767 flight. During the flight, a crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit due to a misunderstanding. The relief First Officer (FO) requested the Flight Attendant to inform the child to look out for a view of Greenland. The Flight Attendant misinterpreted this as an invitation for the child to enter the cockpit. Consequently, the child entered the cockpit, followed by the Flight Attendant. Upon realizing the oversight, the FO secured the cockpit and ensured the child and Flight Attendant were promptly escorted out. The situation was resolved without further complications. The Captain later addressed the Flight Attendant, emphasizing the importance of adhering to security protocols and clarifying instructions to prevent such incidents in the future. The Flight Attendant was reminded to refuse or clarify ambiguous requests regarding cockpit access to ensure passenger and crew safety.",crew-related issues

Several passengers at mid cabin and aft cabin were non-compliant of takeoff instructions and the D and B FA were addressing the issue. Securing the cabin was taking a little longer than normal due to non-compliant passengers. Pilots signaled the cleared for takeoff ding. The 'A' flight attendant did not answer and confirm with pilots that cabin was secured due to the fact that flight attendants were still addressing non-compliant passengers. 'A' flight attendant observed aircraft taxi onto runway and immediately went into take off phase. 'A' flight attendant immediately made pa announcement to all flight attendants to take their seats and secure themselves. 'A' flight attendant was not able to notify the Captain in time to delay take off due to sterile flight deck. Captain did not ask for verbal confirmation if cabin and flight attendants were secured. When we landed and Captain was informed of what happen; there was no concern or remorse from his part and when asked why did he takeoff without confirming cleared for takeoff signal from the 'A' flight attendant his response was 'I heard talk so I assumed you were secured.' I feel there was a breakdown in communication between pilots and flight attendants.Breakdown in communication occurred between the pilots and flight attendants and needs to be addressed. A more paced taxi should take place to allow flight attendants enough time to secure the cabin; galleys and themselves in jump seats including performing the emergency demo on a very short taxi especially at smaller airports. And finally we should possibly add to the present response we have in place to the pilots [something to the effect of reminding passengers to check your seat belts and that the cabin and flight attendants are secure.],,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported a takeoff before the cabin was secured due to some noncompliant passengers and no communication with the flight crew.,"The incident occurred on a B737 flight during which non-compliant passengers delayed the cabin securing process, as the flight attendants were occupied with addressing their behavior. When the pilots signaled clearance for takeoff, the 'A' flight attendant, unable to confirm with the captain due to a sterile flight deck, initiated takeoff without confirmation. After landing, the captain's assumption that the cabin was secure based on hearing passenger conversation highlighted a communication breakdown. The flight attendant suggested solutions: allowing more taxi time for cabin securing, adding passenger reminders, and enhancing communication between flight crew and attendants to prevent future incidents.",crew-related issues

As I was contemplating asking if he needed to use his concentrator during all phases of the flight; I checked my manifest and noticed he wasn't even listed as having an O2 concentrator. As I was about to ask him a question or two; the passenger in 13B asked me if his (12B) O2 bottle ran out; would we have O2 bottles for him to use on board. I almost chuckled as I said 'he's not using O2 from a bottle; it's an O2 concentrator; but we have no info about it even being on board.' She replied that he indeed was using an O2 bottle as he has lung cancer and only 25% use of one of his lungs. I must have had a very odd look on my face as I said 'but he can't bring his own O2 bottle on board an aircraft; totally not allowed!' 'How did you get past the TSA?' She said they discovered the bottle; took it; checked it out; and returned it saying it was okay. My comment was 'they what?' 'So; no one else was informed that you had this and intended to use it on the plane? Turn it off please; now.' I went and retrieved one of our Portable Oxygen Bottles (POBs) and asked the D flight attendant to tell the A flight attendant to notify the flight deck. The passenger in 13B was the girlfriend of the passenger in 12B. She also told me he has used his own POB on many other flights before. She didn't say which airline.Being the C flight attendant; I'm not allowed to be forward of the exit rows for boarding; nor would I leave my cabin area of responsibility prior to takeoff. After takeoff; I'm setting up my cart as the B and D flight attendants are [completing other service duties]. So; not sure how I could have done anything different due to my position. Had I been working a position where I would have seen Mr. [12 B] on what I would have assumed was an O2 concentrator; I would have looked at my manifest to see if he was listed as using one. I would have then asked him if he needed to use it during all phases of flight including takeoff and landing; where I may have asked to move him to a window seat so as not to block/hamper other passengers egress to the main aisle in an emergency. That exchange most likely would have brought about a discovery of an O2 bottle and not a concentrator.I think lesson #1 is never assume a darn thing! Many passengers are not aware they need to disclose plans to use an O2 concentrator and I have watched them come onboard only to discover they aren't listed on my manifest. I then have time to contact an agent to see if they are aware of it and it just hasn't showed up on my manifest yet. I strongly suggest all flight attendants be very aware of passengers using O2 and watch for the device when passengers are boarding; then verify we all know about it. None of that would have mattered in this instance as his O2 bottle was concealed in a small black oblong bag. Boarding an aircraft is a crazy busy time for all concerned. All the more reason to be alert then; as well as any time after takeoff; to things like a passengers using (what should only be) an O2 concentrator and checking to make sure they are listed in our manifest or the proper tag has been placed on it by our agents.,,,,Flight Attendant reported discovering a lung cancer patient inhaling oxygen from a personal bottle not listed on the manifest. The bottle was turned off and replaced with an onboard bottle.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a passenger in seat 12B, diagnosed with lung cancer, used a personal oxygen bottle not listed on the manifest. The flight attendant, initially unaware, was informed by the passenger's girlfriend that TSA had permitted the bottle. Upon realizing the bottle's presence, the flight attendant retrieved an onboard portable oxygen bottle, instructed the passenger to turn off his personal device, and notified the cockpit. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of verifying oxygen device usage and being vigilant during boarding to prevent similar occurrences. The result was the passenger switching to the provided onboard bottle.",crew-related issues

My first officer and I also discussed the likely possibility of a fuel spill somewhere near us on the ramp. In my experience on the MD-80 it is not uncommon to get a faint; exhaust like fume smell in the air conditioning system; and thick condensation during hot; muggy summer nights such as this one was in ZZZ. I assume the smell was stronger in the cabin than in the cockpit since both the FO and I had our air vents closed. The flight attendants requested that I make a PA stating that everything was ok and there was no cause for alarm and we are aware of the condensation and smell; which I did. The two forward flight attendants also informed me that 'they opened the doors in back' which I thought meant that the two rear flight attendants had opened the rear aircraft doors for ventilation. Our number three and one FAs; meant to inform me that passengers were exiting through the over wing exits. This was a simple misunderstanding that was caused by task saturation in the cockpit; monitoring the APU indications; and determining the cause of the smell. I was later informed that passengers took it upon themselves to open all four over wing exits and exit onto the wing. I was told that it was estimated that 15-20 people were on each wing at one point. Our number two flight attendant vocally told passengers to stop exiting through the over wing exits. The FA had no chance to prevent passengers from initiating the uncommanded evacuation given the crowded aisle and interior that is typical of everyone standing when the seat belt sign is turned off. Our number four flight attendant made a PA instructing passengers to stop and to not evacuate or exit though the over wing exits. I did not hear this PA. The FO and I opened our air vents and the fuel odor got stronger and the condensation thickened. I then shut off the Ram Air; APU AIR switch; and both packs; which caused the fuel smell to lessen considerably in intensity and the condensation stopped completely. A man who works the ramp came up to the cockpit and told us we had fuel leaking out of the APU. I then told him to connect external power and I began to shut down the APU. I also told the first officer to go outside and inspect the APU fuel leak with the ops personnel. We informed ground of the fuel leak and we requested ARFF to come inspect the area as a precaution; which they did. I was told by the gate agent that only one person had jumped off the left wing. I was told by operations and my flight attendants that a few passengers came back into the airplane through the over wing doors; and the rest exited the wings on baggage belt loaders. There were no injuries that I know of. This was confirmed by all four flight attendants and ZZZ operations personnel. Upon inspection of the APU; fuel was in fact leaking out of the non-ram door area and the fuel spill was about fifteen feet in diameter. I was instructed by maintenance to pull 5 circuit breakers; which I did; secured the airplane with the securing check; and made the appropriate entries in the maintenance logbook.,,,,A fuel odor; later identified as an APU fuel issue; was detected as passengers began to deplane at the gate. A partial; uncommanded; evacuation was initiated by several passengers via the over wing exits. No injuries were reported.,"The incident occurred after a flight arrived at Airport ZZZ and completed its parking checklist. Upon opening the L1 door, the flight crew and forward flight attendants detected a faint fuel smell, which they initially attributed to external factors such as a neighboring aircraft being fueled, the APU running, and gusty northwest winds. The flight attendants requested the cockpit to make a passenger address (PA) to reassure passengers, which was done. However, there was a misunderstanding regarding the status of the aircraft doors and exits. Passengers, believing there was an emergency, opened the over wing exits and began exiting onto the wings without authorization. Despite efforts by the flight attendants to stop the uncommanded evacuation, several passengers exited before being directed back into the aircraft. The fuel smell intensified, leading the flight crew to shut off the APU and air conditioning systems, which reduced the odor and condensation. A ground staff member informed the cockpit of a fuel leak near the APU, prompting the crew to secure the aircraft, shut down the APU, and request ARFF (Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting) support as a precaution. Maintenance personnel inspected the APU and identified a fuel leak. The crew secured the aircraft, performed the necessary checks, and documented the issue in the maintenance logbook. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further incident. The cause of the fuel odor was later identified as a fuel leak from the APU, which was addressed by maintenance.",crew-related issues

I immediately noticed [female passenger's] head was wrapped in surgical bandages and her face was very swollen.  Her face was so swollen; her eyes were slits. On the left side of her face was a lump about the size of an orange.  Out of concern; I greeted [her] and asked where she was sitting; my motivation being to keep an eye on her during the flight.  [Male companion] showed me his wife's ticket; 21E; an exit row seat.  I asked [female passenger] if she knew she was assigned to an exit row seat.  She did not respond and just stared at me with dull; listless eyes.  I thought she might be on some kind of pain medication as a result of her obvious medical condition.  I asked [her] if she was capable of opening an exit window and assisting in the event of an emergency.  She continued to stare blankly at me and not answer my questions.  [Male companion]; speaking for his wife; said 'of course she can!'  He told me that the gate agent assigned us these seats.  Purser witnessed [female passenger's] condition; my asking her emergency exit questions; [her] not responding and her husband responding for her.  When I told [male companion] we would need to relocate them to another economy plus seat; [he] indicated he was unwilling to have their seats changed.  At that point; [the Purser] went to find a CSR to handle the situation.The [passengers] took their seats at the exit row.  Boarding continued and my attention was soon diverted from boarding to a CSR speaking loudly to [the Purser] near me in the First Class galley.  He was challenging her judgement about [female passenger's] condition and he did not want to move the [passengers].  I offered CSR my assessment of [female passenger]; saying I believed she was not qualified or capable of assisting in an evacuation. I told him that she did not respond to my exit row verification questions and that I thought she might be on some kind of medication that would also inhibit her ability to assist. CSR was visibly not calm or controlled.  His voice was loud and he appeared to be taking our request to relocate the [passengers] out of the exit row personally.  [He] snapped back at me 'did you ask her if she was on medication?'  I replied the husband was insisting he and his wife not be moved and because the door was still open; it was not my responsibility to ask any passenger if they are on medication.  [CSR] left the plane saying he was calling his supervisor.  [Purser] went to the cockpit to inform the Captain about the problem.  The Captain supported our concern and put in his request that Customer Service reseat the [passengers]. The Captain was on the jet bridge; talking to the Customer Service supervisor and CSR. Another gate agent reseated the [passengers].  The door was closed and we took off.  Within minutes of wheels up and before the inflight announcements were made; we heard the call chime. I could see the light was near the [particular passengers] so I made my way toward the call light to where they were sitting.  [The female passenger] was unconscious; shaking and being held by her husband.  I went forward and immediately notified [Purser].  We had an emergency room doctor in 2A and he immediately responded.  [Purser] notified the cockpit and served as communicator while I assisted the doctor.  Another doctor and a surgical nurse were across the aisle from the [passengers] and they both assisted the emergency room doctor.  It was determined by the doctors that [the female passenger] had suffered a seizure and possibly a post-op blood clot to the brain or stroke.  The doctors agreed an emergency divert was necessary.  We landed in Airport ZZZ where [the female passenger] was removed by EMT.,,During boarding; I noticed a couple seated in the exit row at 21 E and F. The woman had a heavily bandaged head and her eyes did not seem to focus completely (as though she was on medication). They both had carry-on items and 2 large bed pillows at their feet; blocking access to the window exit. When I attempted to explain that the items had to be stowed; the man interrupted me and said; 'She can do it' apparently referring to her ability to open the window exit in an emergency. My flying partner indicated that they were being moved to other seats. I was very surprised to see that they had been seated in the emergency exit row to begin with and said the same to our purser; who had already brought the issue up with the CSR working the flight. As it turned out; the woman had a medical event during the flight and the plane was diverted to Airport ZZZ; where she was removed from the flight and taken to the hospital.,,Two flight attendants requested that passengers be relocated from exit row seating due to concern over the female passengers state of health. Customer Service was resistant but eventually reseated the passengers. Shortly after takeoff; the female passenger was reported to have become unconscious. A medical diversion took place where the passenger was removed from the flight.,"The incident originated from concerns raised by the flight attendant regarding a female passenger's medical condition, which included bandaged head injuries, facial swelling, and possible medication use. The passenger's husband insisted she could perform emergency exit duties, despite her unresponsive nature to relevant questions. The flight attendant sought to reseat the passenger from an exit row due to her medical state. The Customer Service Representative (CSR) initially resisted this request. After consultation with the purser and supervisor, the passengers were reseated. Post-takeoff, the female passenger experienced a medical emergency, leading to an in-flight call for medical assistance. An emergency room doctor and other medical personnel assessed her condition, diagnosed a possible seizure or clot, and recommended a diversion. The flight was diverted to Airport ZZZ, where the passenger was removed by EMTs and taken to the hospital. The flight resumed its journey after the incident was resolved.",crew-related issues

I couldn't imagine starting off a flight any better. I ask my First officers (FO) what their plans were for meal service and then shared this with both Purser and the galley person so as have a plan and to work out reasonable expectations. The Relief Pilot did not want to eat until after the first break. Both the First Officer and I said 'if you have our snacks or cold breakfast we will take that now so as to unburden you until after the passenger meal service is complete. Unfortunately only the hot meals were aboard so we all agreed that 45 minute after takeoff (ATO) our food would be put in the oven to be eaten at XA:15 ATO. This is my typical communication while finding the right balance and compromise to promote a positive working together atmosphere. Forty-five minutes after takeoff; I called and verified the meals were being heated and he said yes. (XA:30 ATO) about forty-five minutes after the meals being heated I needed to use the rest room and thought this was a good time since the meals should have been ready 15 minutes ago. This would also minimize the cockpit door from being opened and also reduce disturbing the passenger service flow. During this door opening the galley person seemed just a little off and spoke almost too quick to understand and said something about our meals and that he put the wrong ones in but that he had them in now and they needed another seven minutes; I said cool; no worries and the door closed.(XB:15 ATO) Another forty-five minutes goes by and we still have no meals.(XB:45 ATO) I called the galley person and asked about the meals and he said 'we would get them when he was finished with his service' with a firm no-option tone.I immediately called the Purser and informed him the situation and we needed to get our food and was looking for assistance and support from him. It was at this time the Purser stated; 'you need to understand; our procedures; our manual and our training is that the customer comes before the pilot.' I used a firmer voice and said; 'I don't care about the passenger service; we need our food'. Basically his response was sorry that's the way it is! I decided to ACARS Dispatch to get the Duty Manager and an In-Flight supervisor in on the situation. Being refused food and not being contacted or checked in on by the Flight Attendants during the flight (not once) seemed unreasonable; but more importantly it was now deliberate and unsafe. I now realized there was a deliberate 'threat' building here by my very own co-workers and that I needed to address it. I asked to have In-Flight re-assign both the Purser and the Galley person to positions in the aft cabin and to send it over the ACARS. I felt this prudent to defuse the situation and get our food and beverages and that we needed a new Purser and Galley person who understood human physiological needs and 'Safety of Flight' issues. My request was denied by In-Flight operations stating they contractually cannot do that. I sent a message to Dispatch and said ok then I told them I would do it and sent them the details. (XC:00 ATO) Attempting to use 'all resources' to effectively manage this situation; I was going back and forth with dispatch on ACARS for 15 minutes trying to resolve a now serious distraction to the safety of our flight. I am now shocked to find out the Purser actually went on his break and was asleep in spite of my repeated requests for us to have food and knowing this was a major issue. When I called to have the Purser come to the cockpit so I could inform him of the crew position changes I was informed he was on his break and asleep. I am not sure which female Flight Attendant answered the phone but she hesitated when I asked to speak with him; in fact she seemed disturbed that I would call and wake him during his break. At this time I gave a direct order to this Flight Attendant to wake him and have him come to the cockpit with no delay. This was done and the Purser came into the cockpit and I informed him that the company is aware of the situation and that [another Flight Attendant] is now the Purser and that I allowed her to select our new galley person. The original Purser was speechless during my entire briefing as I informed him how both he and the galley person's behavior was appalling; disgusting and unsafe. He didn't respond and was expressionless. It didn't seem to bother him one bit.The Assistant Chief Pilot met the flight and was informed of the situation. He was professional and supportive. A Supervisor for the Flight Attendants then arrived. First Officer from my flight was present. We had a quick introduction and went to the first class cabin where all the Flight Attendants were sitting. Both supervisors were introduced and I went ahead and told them exactly what I thought of their behavior and how it negatively affected the flight. I told both the Purser and the galley person their behavior was disgusting; unprofessional and unsafe. I then repeated to the In-Flight Supervisor what the Purser had said to me: 'you need to understand; our procedures; our manual and our training is that the customer comes before the pilot.' I also explained about the three hours of no food in sight and then asked the supervisor to confirm if the above statement was true and his thoughts.In response; and without hesitation; Inflight Supervisor stated unequivocally: 'That's a true statement.'The Assistant Chief Pilot; did not appear happy with that response from the supervisor and jumped in to explain about 'Captain's Authority.' I was so disturbed by the statement that I informed the [Chief Pilot] was leaving because it was pointless to continue this dialogue. At this moment; I realized this is a much bigger issue.,,,,B-757 Captain described an unsatisfactory working relationship with the Purser and the galley person during an oceanic crossing.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight captain and the purser during a flight. The captain aimed to coordinate meal times with the crew and passengers but encountered delays. Despite his efforts to compromise, the purser prioritized passenger service over crew needs, leading to a breakdown in communication. The captain sought assistance from dispatch, requesting reassignment of the purser and galley person, but this was denied. The purser's unresponsiveness during a critical period further frustrated the captain, who then addressed the issue with higher authorities. However, the situation remained unresolved, highlighting a broader issue within the organization. The summary underscores the importance of balancing crew well-being with passenger service and the need for effective support structures.",crew-related issues

She informed us that she wasn't in charge of the galley; but would check. We heard back that they would 'need to make some room in the oven' as they were already full with the first class meals. She made mention that she may need to cook them in the back; but since we were boarding she couldn't cook them on the ground. The Captain stated that it was fine; because we didn't want our meals until after we took off. One hour after departure; I called back to query the status of the meals; as I was the non-flying pilot. I spoke with [a flight attendant] who said that the meals had been cooked and she was waiting on a blocker. I called again [20 minutes later] and [the flight attendant] answered the interphone. I told him we had been waiting for our meals for an hour and a half. He stated that [they] didn't have a blocker; as they were finishing cart service in the back and were coordinating to open the door in a few minutes. After parking at the gate I was waiting for the Captain on the jet bridge. [Two flight attendants] questioned him about the crew meals. [One] said that they weren't allowed to interrupt the passenger service to bring us our crew meals. [Flight attendant] then stated that I was 'rude' and 'demanding'. I could hear the entire conversation from the jet bridge. The Captain stated that we coordinated on the ground for the meals after take-off and they should have been brought to us sooner. Being forced to wait for meals is a safety issue and we shouldn't need to call back multiple times to question the status to take us away from our flying duties. Furthermore; I think it was unprofessional for [the flight attendants] to question the Captain about his request for the meals early and complain about the First Officer while the passengers were deplaning. It causes me concern and makes me question [whether] direction by the cockpit could have been followed in an emergency.,,,,B737 First Officer reported difficulty getting the flight attendants to bring up crew meals in a timely fashion.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding the timely delivery of crew meals. The Captain requested the meals after takeoff, but the flight attendant indicated the galley was busy preparing first-class meals, suggesting they might be delayed. An hour later, the First Officer inquired about the meals and was told they were ready but needed a blocker. Upon follow-up, the flight attendant mentioned they were finishing passenger service. Post-landing, the Captain was approached by attendants who questioned the meal timing. One attendant criticized the First Officer, prompting the Captain to express concerns about professionalism and crew coordination during emergencies. The delayed meals were seen as a safety issue, affecting crew duties and raising questions about emergency preparedness.",crew-related issues

Had no official pickup time from hotel so went down at XA:05 local for a XB:47 departure to be sure we were on time. After about 40 minutes in lobby; saw a car from company which does our transportation dropping off a crew. Went out and asked if he was our ride to airport. He said no; but our ride would be there. Later; hotel employee asked if I was Captain X; I said I was. He said operations was on phone and wondered where we were. Replied still waiting for airport ride. He took contact information and called ride service. The problem was scheduling never arranged for ride to airport with re-assignment. Finally got ride to airport. Apparently; an announcement had been made; flight delayed due to pilots not showing up. True; but only because Scheduling hadn't done their job getting us transportation. Got on plane; first thing FAs say is they're 'pissed.' Don't ask what happened; just start yelling at us. Only FA A showed any professionalism; listened to flight brief etc. even after situation explained to FAs B and C. FA D never even showed his face. Our position and authority were totally undermined by company and FA behavior. Only FA A could have been counted on in an emergency. Shouldn't have even left the gate looking back on it. Only trying to make right by passengers drove us to continue. Both B and C made very disparaging comment upon their arrival to plane. An explanation of circumstances changed nothing. FA D totally pretended we didn't exist. Upon leaving plane I said see you to D; he said; 'oh yeah; you will see me.' Was this some sort of threat? We didn't even feel comfortable eating our meals; fear they'd be tampered with considering the FA vitriol. This wasn't a safe flight; and in fact we were working in a very hostile environment. Somebody at the Company failed to do their job; and it was blamed on the pilots. The safety of this flight was very impaired by the actions of FAs B; C; and D. And perhaps by whomever at the company didn't own up to their error; and blaming us. But the FAs need to be professional; even if it would have been our fault; which it wasn't. They compromised safety.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported being rescheduled during a layover; but the scheduling department failed to set up transportation resulting in a late arrival at the aircraft. The flight attendants are furious at the delay and are not interested in what caused it. The Captain believed that the safety of this flight was compromised by the attitude of the flight attendants.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight crew and three flight attendants (FAs) due to a scheduling mishap and subsequent professional misconduct. The flight crew was reassigned to an earlier flight without timely transportation arrangements, causing a delay. They waited 40 minutes for a ride, which was eventually arranged but led to the flight being delayed because the crew was late. Upon boarding, FAs B, C, and D displayed anger and hostility towards the crew without listening to their explanation. FAs B and C yelled and made disparaging comments, while FA D ignored the crew. Only FA A remained professional. The crew felt their authority was undermined and safety compromised by the FAs' behavior. They were uncomfortable, fearing potential tampering with their meals and feeling threatened by FA D's comment. Despite the hostile environment, the crew continued the flight to ensure passenger comfort, though they were uneasy. The crew accused the company of failing to address the scheduling error and blamed the FAs' unprofessional behavior for impairing flight safety. They emphasized the need for FAs to maintain professionalism, even in challenging situations.",crew-related issues

On the first night all three flight attendants were placed on separate floors; causing unsafe hotel conditions. The problem was only fixed the next night after I; as A Flight Attendant; asked that it not happen again. Although the Captain did state during his briefing that safety was most important; he failed to communicate when there was turbulence. I understand that there are times when it comes on unexpectedly but when it did come on he would not switch the seat belt sign on until we called up to have it done; and did not call back to alert or inform us. He also opened the flight deck door to use the restroom without informing the flight attendants so that we could pull out a cart to block off the aisle. There was a pilot jumpseating in the flight deck; but blocking protocol should still have been followed. I quickly pulled a cart out when I saw him and blocked off the aisle as per procedure. During the last flight of the night we were experiencing extremely moderate turbulence; due to the storms on the East Coast; and as A Flight Attendant I determined that it was unsafe for the B and C flight attendants to be out in the aisles at all; let alone with a cart; so the C Flight Attendant called up to the Captain to ask if he could make an announcement that the last water and coffee service of the night would be canceled. When he did he told the passengers to ring their call button if they needed anything. While the flight attendants in the back were still experiencing turbulence the Captain asked for coffee; which is a hot beverage. As the water was shut off in the front galley the only coffee was in the back where they were experiencing the brunt of the turbulence that was already communicated to the pilots. Several landings were more rough than necessary; one caused several passengers in the cabin to scream; while another got aborted by ATC for coming in at the wrong angle. We had to re-ascend and do it over. We also had an on ground delay during the trip; and the Captain failed to update the passengers every 15 minutes as per protocol. When I asked him if there were any updates he was very short with me.It would seem to me that most of these problems could be solved by this pilot communicating better. The conditions of this trip were such that the flight attendants felt as though lines of communication were lacking between the Captain and cabin crew. This creates an unsafe work environment when the cabin crew does not feel comfortable communicating their conditions to the flight deck. On several occasions throughout the trip the flight attendants expressed to me their feelings of un-safeness. If an emergency were to happen we weren't sure that we would be given all the information we would need to properly keep passengers and ourselves safe.,,,,An A320 Lead Flight Attendant reported a Captain's poor communication skills made the crew feel unsafe after he refused to turn the seat belt sign ON during turbulence; disregarded the cabin crew's other requests and then requested hot coffee during turbulence. Poor landings and a go-around also contributed to the sense.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the captain regarding communication and safety protocols during a flight. The flight attendant reported that the captain demonstrated poor communication skills, which led to unsafe conditions for the cabin crew. Specific issues included the captain failing to promptly activate the seatbelt sign during turbulence, disregarding requests from the cabin crew, and requesting hot beverages during turbulent conditions. Additionally, the captain did not follow proper blocking protocols when using the restroom, and several rough landings, including an aborted landing, occurred. The flight attendant also noted that the captain did not provide timely updates to passengers during an on-ground delay, despite protocol requiring updates every 15 minutes. These incidents created a sense of insecurity among the cabin crew, as they felt communication lines were inadequate, potentially compromising safety in an emergency. The flight attendant suggested that improved communication between the captain and cabin crew could address these issues.",crew-related issues

No inop or deactivated label was present by this CB and no documentation in the logbook could be found regarding this CB so Maintenance was notified. After Maintenance researched the aircraft's history no reason could be found for the CB to be open so the Mechanic closed the CB and signed off the corresponding logbook entry I had written. It is unknown how long this aircraft had been operating with this CB collared.Second; I was informed by the Purser that the aft galley had no electrical power so the utility bus switches were cycled to reset the system and I called a flight attendant in the aft galley to confirm if the galley had power. I was told the power was on and no mention was made of any open CB. I informed the Purser the aft galley power was on. Much later and just prior to departure I was informed that that the forward galley had no electrical power (in spite of the fact the First Officer had requested a cup of coffee some fifteen minutes earlier prior to departing on this all night flight). My experience and intuition dictated an inspection of the forward galley where I immediately discovered two forward galley CBs open. Again Maintenance was notified. The Mechanic informed me that earlier he had opened both the forward and aft galley CBs for reasons I do not fully understand but not related to any aircraft airworthiness or mechanical issue. The Mechanic reset the forward galley CBs and normal galley power was restored.Third; I then needed to confirm the aft galley was powered and if any crew member had reset the aft galley CBs. Power was normal and when asked directly about open CBs a flight attendant admitted that a flight attendant had reset the CBs. I asked him to come forward and we stepped onto the jet bridged where I discretely counseled him that he must never reset a CB and always inform the Captain of any CB that might be found open. The flight soon departed and upon arrival at our destination; as the crew deplaned; I asked three of the flight attendants what they believed should be done if they find a CB open. Their confident consensus was that they could reset the CB one time while on the ground and that notifying the Captain was not required. I informed them of the correct policy but they persisted that their rules allowed them to reset a CB. I further explained the policy was for safety reasons and that I was not authorized to ever reset a CB. I encouraged them to research the issue.It appears many flight attendants may not understand our CB policy and their responsibility to inform the Captain of aircraft discrepancies. Specifically; I recommend an immediate system wide electronic message to all flight attendants reminding them of the CB policy and their responsibility to inform the Captain of all maintenance related issues. Additional periodic training also seems to be required for all flight attendants. Note: On other flights; I have had flight attendants bypass me WHEN I'M PRESENT to inform Maintenance of an issue and only later do I happen to learn of the problem; and have been told by flight attendants pre-departure that: 'you can write it up when we get to our destination' as if they have that authority. Initiative by flight attendants to notify appropriate agencies for support should not be discouraged when the flight crew is not present but they should be reminded that they still have the responsibility to insure the Captain is informed.,,,,A B757-200 Captain utilized the occasion of finding an open and banded Circuit Breaker (CB) during preflight to address what he believes to be diametrically opposed understanding of undirected CB operation between flight crew and cabin staff. He further addressed what he believes to inappropriate direct flight attendant/maintenance interface without prior consultation with the Captain.,"During the pre-flight preparation for a B757-200 flight, the Captain discovered an open Circuit Breaker (CB) with a red collar in the potable water system. No documentation or labels indicated a known issue with the CB, so Maintenance was notified. After researching the aircraft's history, Maintenance found no explanation for the CB being open and closed it, signing off in the logbook. Later, the Captain addressed issues with galley power and discovered two forward galley CBs open. Maintenance explained they had opened and closed the forward and aft galley CBs earlier for unclear reasons, unrelated to airworthiness or mechanical issues. The Captain was concerned about the lack of communication regarding these actions. Upon further investigation, the Captain learned that a flight attendant had reset the aft galley CB without informing the Captain. The Captain discreetly counseled the flight attendant on the proper procedure to report any CB issues. After the flight, the Captain questioned other flight attendants about their understanding of CB policies. Their responses indicated a lack of awareness, as they believed they could reset CBs once without notifying the Captain. The Captain emphasized that flight attendants should always inform the Captain of any CB issues and highlighted the importance of adhering to safety protocols. The Captain recommended implementing a system-wide electronic message to remind all flight attendants of the CB policy and their responsibility to report discrepancies to the Captain. Additionally, periodic training was suggested to reinforce these procedures. The Captain also expressed concern about instances where flight attendants bypassed the Captain to communicate directly with Maintenance, even when the Captain was present.",crew-related issues

The flight attendant confiscated the item, secured it by placing it in double bags, and stored it in the wheelchair compartment for the remainder of the flight. Upon landing, the flight attendant informed the Captain about the confiscation and the need to notify Ground Security but forgot to hand over the FRH due to being occupied with assisting an unaccompanied minor and managing crew changes. The FRH was not delivered to Ground Personnel after the flight, resulting in the item not being properly handed over. To prevent such occurrences, it is recommended that flight attendants implement a more rigorous handover procedure, such as setting reminders or ensuring a structured process for transferring items to Ground Personnel, especially when faced with multiple duties post-landing.",crew-related issues

I was the #4 Flight Attendant this flight. At around 500 FT before landing I looked over at the Number 2 Flight Attendant on this flight and we both just stared at each other and then looked outside to see where we were to touching down. I knew we were too high to land and that our landing did not feel normal. The plane started to sink; and we heard the engines being pushed to throttle and we thought the pilot was going to possibly attempt a go-around. We hit the runway incredibly hard bounced up in the air and then I felt the right wing tip way to way close to the ground. I was actually looking outside to see just how close we were to hitting the wing tip and rolling over. At this point the plane was sideways and was squirreling all over the place. I thought we were going to have a crash landing. After we got to the gate at no time did the pilots call back and see if we were ok. The pilots at no time made a P.A. to the people about what had just happened. After the passengers deplaned and we got up to the flight deck; myself and the Number 2 Flight Attendant; we asked the Number 1 Flight Attendant where the flight deck was. Number 1 stated the Captain told her; 'I can't believe I almost crashed this plane and took off outside to look at the plane'. After our 2nd terrifying landing in 2 weeks on another 737; and not being able to talk to our Captain or First Officer; the Numbner 2 and I removed ourselves from our last two legs of our trip. We both were shook up. This was our 2nd unreal and terrible distressing landing in 2 weeks. On both of these incidents the weather did not play a factor. It was sunny and warm. On our flight back to base one of our 737 Captains had just finished his recurrent training. We had both flown many times together without such incidents taking place. He was the only pilot to give us some possible explanations. One; on the earlier incident; the Captain was new to the left seat and needs additional training. Or two it was a max flaps 40 involvement. He explained that some pilots like to practice using the 40 setting; when it really is only supposed to be used on short runways like LGA; DCA; and BOS. At our meeting; the Chief Pilot was initially in the meeting and told my friend and I that; 'this would happen again.' This statement was shocking to us because we have both flown this plane many times without these terrible landings taking place. It should be noted that for many years both Number 2 and I have flown the 737 and every plane this airline has had and never had any landings like these last two.This incident was on our first trip of the month. The earlier event; we had completed a turn I was the Number 4 Flight Attendant; and my friend was the Number 2 Flight Attendant on this flight. This was a really terrifying landing. The Captain came on the P.A. and told us and the passengers that it was 84 degrees and the wind was 5 MPH. He then told us to prepare for landing. My friend and I prepared the cabin and did our final cabin checks and took our jump seats and belted in. We first started to feel our plane did not feel right as we were around approximately 1;000 FT. We looked at each other and looked outside to see how close we were getting to touching down. As we stated to get closer to landing we both knew that everything about this landing did not feel normal; the position of the plane and the attitude. We hit so hard the plane bounced 8 to 9 feet; slammed down again on the runway and we bounced another 5 feet; and then our planes wings tipped so low to the ground; they went right to left and I told my friend to 'cover her eyes.' We both felt the plane was going to crash. After we got to the gate again the pilots never came on to talk to the passengers or to us the crew. By the time the Number 2 and I got up to the flight deck the Captain was gone. My friend spoke to the First Officer; and asked; 'what just happened; what was the landing all about?' The First Officer replied something about the winds; and my friend said no; there was no wind. Then the First Officer told my friend 'that the Captain was fairly new to the left seat'. This was a terrifying landing.,,The event occurred because the pilot lost wind. He was going to do a go-around but decided to land the aircraft because he was lined up. However; we were still too high when he landed and we knew he was making a decision when we heard the engines flare and then we dropped down around 50 feet to the ground.We are the eyes and ears of this operation so everyone says. However; when we have negative issues to discuss most pilots leave us hanging with unresolved answers and emotions. Yes; we are able to feel when things are off with the engines; landings; weather. If the only thing the pilot is worried about is his aircraft and not his crew; we have a long way to go. A pilot that clearly knows that an incident occurred should at the very least call back and make sure that his crew is ok. If he could provide information as to what happened; would be great. Everyone says the back of the B737 feels totally different from the front of the aircraft and it's true.,,Two B737-800 Flight Attendants report a Captain; apparently new to the left seat; lost control of the aircraft in the flare and made a very hard landing which resulted in two bounces before coming to stop.,"The incident involved two hard landings on a B737-800 aircraft, experienced by two flight attendants during separate flights. In both cases, the landings were described as abnormal, with the aircraft feeling unstable and the pilots failing to communicate effectively with the cabin crew or passengers afterward. The first landing occurred during final approach, with the aircraft feeling too high before touchdown. The plane bounced upon impact, with the right wing tip nearly touching the ground, causing concern among the flight attendants about a potential crash. After the incident, the pilots did not address the crew or passengers, leaving the flight attendants unsettled. The second landing was similarly hard, with the aircraft bouncing multiple times and the wings tilting dangerously low. The flight attendants reported that the captain, who was apparently new to the left seat, lost control during the flare. After landing, the captain did not communicate with the crew, and the first officer mentioned the captain's inexperience as a possible contributing factor. Both incidents occurred under clear weather conditions, with no apparent external factors. The flight attendants expressed frustration over the lack of communication from the pilots and the unresolved nature of the incidents. They also noted that the captain may have been practicing with max flaps 40, which is typically reserved for short runways, as a potential factor in the hard landings. The flight attendants removed themselves from their duties following the second incident, citing the traumatic nature of the events and their concern for safety. The chief pilot acknowledged the issue but did not provide a definitive resolution, leaving the flight attendants shaken and uncertain about future flights. The attendants suggested that the captain, who was new to the left seat, may require additional training, particularly regarding the appropriate use of flaps during landing. They also emphasized the need for better communication between pilots and cabin crew in the event of an incident.",crew-related issues

A few minutes later we received an ACARS message that a new maintenance release was required as well as a status message on the printer advising the aircraft was ready for release. Before having an opportunity to address the maintenance status the lead flight attendant advised she was concerned about the location of an armed passenger and the status of a dog on board and advised another attendant had had a verbal conflict with a gate agent regarding overhead bin space and was asking for our intervention. Finally after dealing with these issues we pushed back and immediately realized we hadn't called maintenance about the unusual maintenance release status. Maintenance attempted to send the release to the printer but were unable. They then sent a truck out with a hard copy passed in through a cockpit window.

Before addressing this, they had to handle concerns from the flight attendants regarding an armed passenger, a dog onboard, and a verbal conflict with a gate agent over overhead bin space. After resolving these issues, the crew pushed back and started engines, only to realize they lacked a maintenance release. Maintenance attempted to send the release digitally but failed, opting instead to deliver a hard copy via the cockpit window. The flight crew proceeded safely with the hard copy.

The cabin crew had not completed their final safety checks and announcements when the 'clear for departure' chime sounded. As a result, the cabin crew was still in the aisle when the aircraft began takeoff, leading to one flight attendant being thrown and struggling to secure their harness. The flight crew also faced difficulties as a flight crew member was thrown against the galley, dropping their equipment. The cause was the cabin crew's inability to finish their safety procedures before takeoff. The process involved the premature initiation of takeoff without the cabin being secure. The result was a safety concern due to the crew's struggles during takeoff.

This action ensured the problem was addressed, preventing potential delays or cancellations. The proposed solution was to engage maintenance and verify procedures, which was implemented to resolve the issue.",crew-related issues

Flight Crew reported to Maintenance a squeal in the cabin during Deadhead to ZZZ1. Line Maintenance arrived to investigate and requested Flight Crew to start engines with [Main Cabin] door shut. After listening in the cabin at normal pressure levels on the ground; Maintenance put aircraft pressurization system into manual mode and descended the cabin until reaching 3.0 psi and back to unpressurized; approximately 15 minutes. Crew experienced uncomfortable ear pressure but no other medical concerns. Maintenance tightened a connection in Pack-1 and Aircraft returned to service. In ZZZ; the following morning; Captain obtained a copy of the Maintenance procedures including the BOLD WARNING about non-essential personnel not being onboard. This pressurization took the flight crew to a cabin altitude below sea level; there is concern similar to a scuba dive. Pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable. Company Medical was called; but by this time it was 24 hours past the pressurization event. The flight attendant; who has a hearing impairment and wears hearing aids; reported being more plugged up than usual and was removed at Company Medical Doctor's request. The Flight Crew unaware pressurization to 3.0 psi was planned. Line Maintenance did not have copy of procedure with them. Flight Crew unaware of potential hazard due to no briefing from Maintenance personnel and no written copy of maintenance procedure. Ensure that when procedures are communicated from Maintenance Control to Line Maintenance; that warnings are transmitted. Provide written guidance on Flight Crew assisting Maintenance or provide adequate personnel to perform procedure without ANY assistance from Flight Crew.,Reporter stated the air conditioning packs on the EMB-145 are located in the wing root area under the cabin seats. The cabin pressure controller knob is extremely sensitive and controlling a rate of descent of 500 feet per minute is very difficult in the manual mode. The EICAS display indicated the cabin pressure had gone down to 1;500 feet during the ground pressurization leak check. What the actual pressure ended up being; he is not sure; but flying at altitude after that may not have been advisable as he learned later.,Crew was Deadheading in the cabin on an EMB-145 aircraft to ZZZ1 and heard a squeal sound when pilots added power. Upon landing captain informed Maintenance Control. Control contacted ZZZ1 contract mechanic to investigate a squeal sound in the aircraft cabin. Maintenance Control directed crew to start engines while contract mechanic and Maintenance Control investigated the squeal. Contract mechanic was on the phone with Maintenance Control. The mechanics believed the issue was a loose connection in the PACK systems. However; without the flight crew knowing; Maintenance Control directed contract mechanic to conduct an 'air check.'Crew was unaware of this procedure and not briefed prior. Contract mechanic did not have a checklist. Flight Attendant was onboard. Contract mechanic; under the direction of Maintenance Control; and without warning to the crew onboard; pressurized the cabin substantially below sea level using the manual mode pressurization system to achieve a 3.0 psi pressure differential. Crew and contract mechanic experienced uncomfortable ear pressures during the procedure and the procedure was stopped within 15 minutes. Contract mechanic tightened the PACK connections and under the direction of Maintenance Control the contract mechanic signed off his work. Crew did not report any medical conditions preventing the safe operation of the aircraft. Flight operated safely back to base; conducting flight back to ZZZ. This report is being submitted for the operation of two flights; ZZZ-ZZZ1-ZZZ; because the crew were on board an aircraft which was pressurized below sea level prior to these flights. The concern arises from the possibility that pressurizing the aircraft to a pressure below sea level may expose flight crews to injuries similar to those of scuba divers. Captain contacted Maintenance Controller X who stated that this procedure was not dangerous. Captain obtained the 'leak check' procedure from ZZZ Company Maintenance department and found the procedure was not what the crew witnessed. The crew did not have prior knowledge of the Medical Warning found on page one of the procedure. Captain contacted ZZZ Chief Pilot who did not know how to proceed but directed the captain to Company Medical. Captain called Company Medical whose Doctor concluded that further flights would be safe because 12-hours had elapsed from the exposure. However; Flight Attendant; who wears hearing aids was removed by Company Medical Doctor to evaluate ear conditions prior flying again.Crew was not briefed that Maintenance Control had directed contract mechanic to conduct a 'leak check.' Contract mechanic under the authority of Maintenance Control conducted the check without a visual checklist. This is not the first report captain has submitted highlighting the prevalence of Maintenance Control talking contract mechanics through a procedure via telephone. This practice is potentially dangerous especially if the WARNINGS in the procedures are not communicated to those persons inside an aircraft during these procedures. Company should issue written standards to the flight department outlining the approved procedures which would allow pilots and crew to assist contract mechanics with the servicing and maintaining of the aircraft fleet. These verbal procedures are potentially hazardous especially to flight crew because flight crew often operate in extreme environments and with limited time on the ground to acclimate or recover from exposures. Because the FAA relies largely on the science of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) for infection control procedures; then FAA should likely consult hyperbaric medical societies for procedures involving aircraft pressurization and the standards for medical screening of crew and passengers involved in these procedures and involved in inflight rapid depressurization events.,,A Contract Mechanic was directed by Maintenance Control to pressurize the cabin of an EMB-145 aircraft to below sea level in the manual mode. Flight crew and Flight Attendant were not made aware after being requested to start engines with the main cabin door closed. Uncomfortable ear pressure was experienced. Crew departed in the morning; but pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable due to scuba dive effect.,"The incident involved an EMB-145 aircraft operated by a flight crew from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and back. During the deadhead trip, the crew heard a squeal in the cabin and reported it to maintenance. Maintenance requested the crew to start engines with the cabin door closed and proceeded to manually pressurize the cabin to 3.0 psi without informing the crew. This resulted in uncomfortable ear pressure for the crew and the flight attendant, who has a hearing impairment, leading to her removal by a doctor. The root cause was the maintenance team's failure to brief the crew, lack of a checklist, and reliance on verbal procedures. The captain later discovered that the procedure followed wasn't the standard one, and this wasn't the first such incident, highlighting potential dangers of verbal communication in extreme environments. The proposed solutions include establishing written company procedures for maintenance and crew assistance, and consulting medical experts for safer pressurization standards. The outcome emphasized the need for clear communication and standardized procedures to prevent future incidents.",crew-related issues

My partner & I were dispatched to repair the items that the crew had written in the logbook. My partner & I repaired multiple coach seat issues & flight deck door issues. The logbook was signed and return to the flight deck. As we exit the acft the flight attendant called us back to the acft and mentioned to us that the ELT lanyard was unfolding. I removed the ELT from behind first class seats. I showed her that one of the water automatic release tape came unfastened. I mentioned to her to have the crew put it in the logbook when they arrived at the acft. I also mentioned to her that I am removing the ELT from the acft for repair and I will be returning with it prior to departure for re-installment to the acft. I went to the stock room at the hangar and to obtain another automatic release tape and res-secured the lanyard to the ELT. I immediately return to [the gate] to find out that the acft had already left without the ELT. I immediately notify my lead and he immediately notify the tower foreman. Tower foreman notify us that the acft was getting ready for takeoff and he was unable to have it return to the gate. Tower foreman mention to us that acft was scheduled to depart at XA:55. It left early at XA:44. Acft had already departed and the ELT was still in my possession. Flight attendant probably forgot to mention to the crew when they arrived to the acft. She probably became distracted while performing her cabin duties. Have the flight attendant put the discrepancy in her cabin logbook or remove the logbook from the acft. Upon returning to the acft; have the crew put it in the logbook,,,,A Mechanic removed a component from the aircraft to perform a repair. In the process; the Mechanic notified the Flight Attendant to advise the Flight Crew to write it up. When the Mechanic returned to the gate; the aircraft had departed without the component.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant and a Flight Crew member were involved in aircraft maintenance. The aircraft had logged maintenance issues that were addressed by the maintenance team, including the Flight Attendant. Upon leaving the aircraft, the Flight Attendant noticed an unfolding ELT lanyard. The Mechanist removed the ELT for repair and instructed the Flight Attendant to inform the crew to log the issue. However, the aircraft departed without the ELT, as the Mechanist returned to find it had left early. The cause was likely a communication breakdown, with the Flight Attendant failing to inform the crew, possibly due to being distracted. The result was a potential safety issue with the missing ELT. The proposed solution was for the Flight Attendant to note the discrepancy in the logbook or remove it.",crew-related issues

We landed in ZZZ and deplaning took time. We had a full load of passengers and numerous wheelchairs.  Cockpit crew finished their day and left the aircraft.  Flight Attendants waited for the last passenger to deplane and walked out the Jetway with the Ground Agent. I asked the Agent which gate was Flight ABCC.  Agent responded 'Gate XX'.As I look to the right at Gate XX the agents are in the process of pulling tickets and boarding the aircraft.  The captain was behind the podium pulling his paperwork.  As I approached the gate I thought another flight may have still been on the gate. Then I read the signage at Gate XX; Flight ABCC. I asked the pilot if he was working the Flight ABCC.  He answered 'yes'. I told him we were his cabin crew.  Because of our late arrival time from ZZZ1 did they pull another crew to work to ZZZ3?  The captain gave me the crew list and we were still the original working crew. I asked 'Who is on the aircraft boarding the flight? I stated to the agent 'We are the working crew'. 'Who is on the aircraft boarding the flight'?Agent A looked at Agent B and asked 'Didn't you check the crew?  Who is on board the aircraft'?  Agent A sent Agent B down the Jetway to check if there was a crew on board.  Agent A then checked my ID and the rest of the working crew ID's and we proceeded down the Jetway. We passed Agent B in the Jetway and she confirmed there was 'no crew on board'.  This was a 757 aircraft; we were using the L2 door for boarding.I entered the aircraft there were between 10-15 passengers on board. Approximately six (6) passengers in First Class; the catering representative in the First Class galley wanting to check the galley packing; a non-working uniformed pilot was trying to stow his too-fat for the overhead suitcase in the closet; agent gave an unaccompanied child UNACH to Flight Attendant #4 to sign for and bring on board the aircraft; before the cabin crew had a chance to stow our luggage and check out safety equipment.,,,,A B757 flight attendant crew arrived late for their flight because of weather delays and found that the gate agents had begun boarding their flight without them having had the opportunity to do their pre-flight checks. The aircraft was not ready for boarding.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant crew, delayed by 1 hour and 19 minutes due to weather conditions, snow, and de-icing, arrived at the gate to find that boarding had already begun for their flight without them. The ground personnel had started the process of boarding the aircraft, with approximately 10-15 passengers on board, including an unaccompanied child and crew members stowing personal luggage, despite the flight attendants not having completed their pre-flight safety checks. The flight attendants were initially mistaken for another crew due to a miscommunication. After verifying their identities and confirming that no other crew was on board, the original flight attendant crew proceeded to board the aircraft. The situation was resolved when the original crew assumed their duties, but the incident highlighted the importance of proper crew communication and pre-flight preparation to ensure passenger safety.",crew-related issues

We accomplished the takeoff check; took the runway for departure; and climbed out uneventfully. After notifying the flight attendants that we were above 10;000 feet; one of them called to inform us that we had neglected to inform them that we were ready for takeoff; and one of them had to rush back to her seat to get seated on time.

We were on an aircraft that does not nor has it ever had life vests under the seats for as long as it has been in the fleet. Because we were in sterile flight deck; I waited until we got above 10;000 feet; made my announcement; helped the B Flight Attendant set up her cart; then called the flight deck to notify them of the issue in the recording with the faulty information. My First Officer (FO) answered and I explained to him the issue with the recording saying we had life vests under the seats when we don't; and this aircraft is not supposed to. I told him that I had this aircraft a week or two ago and had already notified management of this issue; but figured since it obviously didn't get resolved yet that maybe it could get corrected while the plane was on overnight if they could write it up or if they knew of a form I could fill out. I was trying to be proactive about a safety issue. My first officer asked a few questions about it to get an understanding of how this aircraft was not supposed to have that recording and how this aircraft never had life vests under the seats to begin with.  I had some troubles hearing him as his microphone was not that loud/clear and it was very loud in the galley. We did end the conversation with an understanding of what the issue was to my knowledge. I hung up with him; at this point the B Flight Attendant had finished her meal service and was breaking down her cart when the phone rang with the flight deck calling. It was my Captain (CA) this time. At this point the plane had made either a slight descent or they slowed down (I could not tell) then the CA proceeded to tell me that the First Officer (FO) was freaking out saying that I told him that we were supposed to have life vests under the seats and we didn't. The CA then told me that they have been in communication with the company that we were going to divert making a code yellow emergency landing in 10 minutes because the FO was freaking out about us not having life vests. I asked the CA if he was serious; which he replied with 'yes' and then I asked him if we could avoid the diversion; that we did not need life vests and he said 'no.' I told the captain that I never told the FO we were supposed to have life vests; that I told him the opposite. The CA then told me that the FO said I did tell him we were missing life vests under the seats that we were supposed to have. I told him no I didn't; that I thought he understood me; but I could hardly understand him.  The CA then said to me 'oh so you're throwing my partner under the bus now?' I said 'no.' He then proceeded to tell me to stay calm about the code yellow emergency landing; let the B Flight Attendant know; he read off the current time to signify the start of the emergency landing; and to pack up all of stuff for landing. That we would be on the ground in 10 minutes and that I needed to call management right away; because they wanted to talk to me about this.  I said ok. The CA said he was going to make an announcement to the passengers at this time to let them know what was going on. My CA's voice during this conversation was stern and gave zero indication that this was anything but serious. I was freaked out; and started to brief my FA with what was going on.  Within a minute or two the flight deck called back while I was briefing her. It was my CA on the phone; and asked if it was me he was speaking with.  Then when I replied 'yes; it is' he started cracking up laughing and said he was kidding; that we were 37 minutes of from landing at destination.  At this point I was so freaked out about him telling me that we were having an emergency landing and that management wanted to talk to me I don't remember what I responded with. Probably something along the lines of 'not cool.' I told the B Flight Attendant thatI felt like I was about to pass out because I was so worked up. At this point CRM had been broken. After that we continued to put our stuff away and take care of our passengers. We could hear loud laughing and talking from the flight deck the rest of the flight. The pilots ended up blowing a procedure by being distracted by their joke and never gave a PA descent announcement to us or the passengers. We started to get pretty low; so I checked my cellphone app to see how far out we were. At this point we were less than 15 minutes out with no announcement or anything from the flight deck. I made the descent announcement to the passengers and within 2 minutes later the 10;000 foot chime went off. We landed and I did not communicate with my pilots. The only thing my CA said to me as I was packing up my bags was that I had a lot of bags and was high maintenance because of that; with a demeaning tone. The B Flight Attendant heard him say this; and told me 'wow; he's picking on you.' I did not reply as I was upset about them joking around about an emergency landing and management wanting to talk to me about it. CRM had already been broken.,,When I had finished my beverage service and was tearing down my cart when the other Flight Attendant (FA); started briefing me that we were going to divert and do an emergency landing. The flight deck then called interrupting her. After she got off the phone she told me they said they were just joking about the emergency landing. She then explained that it started when she had called the Flight deck to ask them to write up the [safety video]. The flight deck played a joke on her saying that because the [safety video] was inaccurate we must land immediately and that he was going to make an announcement to the passengers and she would need to contact management after we landed. Because of this there was a breakdown of CRM. The pilots behaved inappropriately by joking about an emergency landing.,,Regional jet flight attendants discover that the prerecorded passenger safety briefing incorrectly refers to life vests under the seats. The flight crew is notified of the discrepancy and they turn it into a prank stating they will have to make an emergency diversion. A few minutes later they call back to reveal the prank and that they are continuing to destination.,"The incident occurred on a regional jet during a flight when a Flight Attendant (FA) discovered that the prerecorded passenger safety briefing incorrectly stated that life vests were stored under the seats. The aircraft in question does not have life vests under the seats, as it has never been equipped with them. The FA reported this discrepancy to the flight deck after reaching 10,000 feet, informing the First Officer (FO) and subsequently the Captain (CA) about the issue. The FA also mentioned that she had previously reported this problem to management but had not received a resolution. During the communication, the FO misunderstood the FA's intent and believed she was indicating that the aircraft was missing life vests. This misunderstanding led the FO to inform the CA that an emergency landing was necessary. The CA, unaware of the confusion, prepared for a code yellow emergency landing, informing the passengers and directing the FA to contact management immediately. The FA vehemently denied having suggested that life vests were missing, emphasizing that she had pointed out the safety video's inaccuracy. The situation escalated when the CA called the FA again, revealing that the FO had misrepresented the situation. The CA admitted that the previous communication about the emergency landing was a joke, causing further confusion and distress for the FA. The FA felt targeted and upset, particularly when the CA laughed off the situation and corrected the timeline for landing, leaving the passengers and crew uninformed about the delay. The breakdown in Crew Resource Management (CRM) was further evident when the flight deck failed to provide a proper descent announcement, requiring the FA to inform the passengers herself. Upon landing, the CA made a demeaning comment about the FA's luggage, which was overheard by the other Flight Attendant. The incident resulted in a significant breakdown of CRM, impacting the professionalism and safety of the flight. The FA suggested addressing the faulty safety video as a solution to prevent similar issues in the future.",crew-related issues

I did hear the slats come down; however I just thought we were trying to slow down as little.  Next thing I hear is the gear come down.  I had been trying to look out and see how high we were; however I was unable to due to the visibility outside.  As soon as I heard the gear drop I called the flight deck and advised them that the cabin was NO WHERE near secure for landing; as no information was given to the flight attendants.  Also once I called the flight deck; then did the sterile light come on.  I advised them; we had kids standing up; bags out; people out of their seatbelts; and again that the cabin was not secure.  I was asked by the flight deck if we needed to go around; I stated 'YES'.  I was then asked; can you just sit down for landing.  I said UMMMMM yup and hung up the phone!  I made a PA; Flight attendant be seated for landing.  I secured the galley as fast as I could.  And sat in my jump seat; as did the B Flight Attendant.  No final descent announcement was given at all; as there was just not time.  We landed and taxied to the gate with no incident.  After landing; the Captain apologized to me many times.  He stated that they were extremely busy with weather and trying to figure out if we were going to divert to our [alternate].  At the very last minute; the weather improved and they shot the approach and forgot all about us in the back.Flight deck does get busy at times; however they cannot lose sight of what is going on in the back of the aircraft.

The flight crew was preoccupied with weather concerns and attempting to decide whether to divert to an alternate airport. Despite the Flight Attendant's repeated warnings that the cabin was not ready, the flight crew proceeded with landing. The aircraft landed safely and taxied to the gate without further incident.

LFA began Tarmac record. LFA pulled up Tarmac Delay information in [the Ipad]. Passengers begin standing in the aisle stretching legs and standing in line for the 3 lavatories on board. XB:25 [A] Passenger's wife came forward to the galley and stated husband is feeling very nauseous. FA 3 provided his wife with ginger ale; water; trash bag and offered a snack. At this time she refused a snack for him. Then [FA 3] followed passengers to seat to assess.XB:32LFA advised PIC we were in need of our official block out time for delay record. Instead of the block out time PIC informed lead we do not have this time since we are sitting on an active Tarmac. Instead noted and gave the arrival time into the divert airport. XB:42 PIC made announcement we were expecting to depart ZZZ and head to ZZZ1 in about an 1 hour and fifteen minutes. This would give the crew an ETA into our original destination of XC:57. With this ETA given lead then discussed with Flight Deck (FD) the potential for a pour service to be needed. Flight attendants were advised against a pour and snack service to be conducted. XC:00Passengers came forward and stated she was a diabetic and insulin was under the plane. She said she was due for it in about an hour. If we could give her some M&M's and water she would be fine until the delay is completed. Even though this was a medical related issue we did not have to ask for a doctor. Flight deck was notified by LFA. From XB:02 till XC:00 all doors on the aircraft were armed during the tarmac delay! XC:06 The flight deck made an announcement that the aircraft would be taxing to a different fueling area. LFA made prior to aircraft movement announcement minus electronic devices to ensure compliance before saying it was safe to move aircraft. LFA walked the cabin to ensure compliance. FA 2 and 4 were seated in jump seat with aft barrier strap up. FA 2 stated aft cabin secure. A single chime [to] flight deck to signal cabin was ready for movement. Flight deck then called and asked if we were ready for movement. LFA stated to captain 'this is why I single chimed you'.XC:20 Aircraft arrived at fueling area.

XC:27[Another] passenger who had Claustrophobia came forward to the bulk head just looking for space away from other passengers and crew members. Crew members remembered this passenger from the previous week flight. Atthis point we noticed [passenger] very hot; sweaty and in a panic. She was saying can I just get air! She then began vomiting in the trash bag in the galley. LFA made the announcement of do we have any doctors or nurses on board and if so can you ring your FA call button. At this time LFA also notified the flight deck of the situation and we were filling out a cabin report. While the nurse who was chosen by [flight crew] as our medical personnel from mid cabin to come forward. LFA stayed with the passenger ensuring her everything was going to be ok and we were working with the FD for passengers to get off the aircraft.XC:29 PIC headed to aft of the aircraft to do a walk around. PIC asked flight attendants 2 and 4 to hold and watch the tail cone door exit. At this time he went down the steps the FA had deemed to be 'hazardous'.XC:31First Officer (FO) called [FA] into the FD after the cabin report had been given to them. With the cabin report [medical services] was contacted. Once [medical services] was contacted FO gave [FA] his personal cell phone to have the conversation with [medical services]. [Medical services] advised the passenger to begin doing breathing exercises. [Medical services] wanted the use of [oxygen]. [A FA] got the [oxygen] uncovered the mask and the customer felt like it would make her become more claustrophobic. On the cabin report the only medication the passenger stated she had taken was Gravol. At the time I did not know what Gravol was. Passenger said it was motion sickness medicine. When I was writing this report I researched what this drug is. According to [website] Gravol is a new synthetic drug. It is highly addictive and makes users dangerously paranoid; to the point of suicide. It also causes paranoia; kidney failure; hallucination. During the conversation with [medical services] I initiated a crew to crew call with [medical services]. During this short called I asked her to come forward and help with the passenger. [Medical services] at this time stated that the only medicine in our Medical kit which could be administered to the passengers was Benadryl. Passengers refused the Benadryl as well and stated the Gravol should work. Passenger asked if she could sit in a seat in the bulkhead. One of the passengers in [bulkhead seat] heard this comment be made and was willing to move to [passengers] seat. [passenger] thanked the guy in [bulkhead] for doing this for us. [Passenger] calmed down once this decision was made. XC:40 FA 4 stated beverage and snack service as requested was needed for the cabin. Lead had lost track of time during the medicals and everything else; which was taking place in the cabin. Lead notified FD pour service was beginning. XC:41 FA immediately began pour service. We used the plastic bins inside the carts lined them up with cups and started pouring water into them. During this pour service we ran out of water on the carts and crew water. The only water we had left was the water bottles the crew had already drank out of. This service was completed by the 120 minute mark of the delay. XD:19Lead notified Captain we were right at the 3 hour mark of the delay. Passengers even after the service began getting upset. LFA notified flight deck the passengers were beginning to get upset. During the Tarmac delay instead of using the Interphone system to communicate with lead. The flight deck was just opening the door to have communication. LFA ask flight deck if we can go to normal procedures to open the door due how the passengers were being. At this time LFA notified captain that we are getting close to that 3 hour mark of the delay. Asked captain to make another announcement. XD:21Captain advised lead we were about to taxi to gate. FA prepare doors for departure announcement was made. Aircraft was prepared for taxi to the gate. FA did compliance check.XD:27 Announcement was made to prepare doors for arrival. Captain notified FA that the aft stairs would be used for deplaning. FA 2 notified lead the aft stairs were not safe to deplane off of due to the slick liquid (De icing liquid) on the stairs. LFA notified Crew services we did not feel it was safe. They advised us that passengers should take all belongings because there was a chance the plane was going to get Remain Overnight (RON) for the night in the divert airport.XE:30 Captain advised to deplane from the aft stairs even though FA advised against it. As soon as this announcement was made passengers began deplaning prior to LFA finishing her conversation with her supervisor. Once off the phone LFA advised passengers to take all carry on luggage with them down the back stairs of the aircraft and use caution exiting. During the deplaning process [ill passenger's] bag was taken in. LFA asked FD if she could exit aircraft to retrieve her bag. They told LFA to have her contact our supervisor. During the time frame of XE:50 and XG:45[Ill passengers] exited the aircraft not long after the passengers did to deplane. When [medical services] got back onto the plane they stated the passengers are in the terminal area and no one is giving them any updates. They just wanted the pilots or some airline employee to give some updates! XG:45 Began boarding again up the tail cone stairs; which was contaminated with both snow and the deicing fluid. FD asked LFA if we were ok with doing this. After discussion with the crew we decided since they already deplaned off these stairs. It's not safe but [might] as well board and get to our filed destination! Now while boarding the water from snow melting in combination with the deicing fluid made more of the aisle way slick. Just like it was in the departure airport. The flight attendants tried to [mitigate] any risk while boarding and LFA made boarding announcements like normal. While boarding a gentleman near the front of the aircraft stated his name was not on the manifest the gate agent was using. LFA notified flight deck. LFA told the flight deck this could be seen as a security issue. PIC stated a gate agent must tell the flight deck no security issues prior to pushing back. After it appeared boarding was complete FA 2 completed a count when I read the verification announcement. FA's noted we were missing 8 people. This was verified by the gate agent giving FA 2 the names of the individuals to read on the PA. The FA 2 told passengers to ring their FA call buttons if they were on board. FA 4 and 3 re briefed exit rows. PIC handed the paper work through the window of the aircraft to a gate agent. LFA stated 'Cabin Secure!; Clear to Close?' I single chimed FD indicating we were ready for push back. FA 3 asked lead if she was ok with doing the safety demo and she would read the safety demo. I said yes and I did the safety demo in the cabin. After the safety demo I walked down the aisle to ensure compliance again. Once I got back informed passengers we would be dimming the cabin lights for departure and read the deicing announcement. XH:15Finally; we landed in our originally filed destination. Arrival announcement was made and we apologized for the delay. Also; stated use caution when exiting the aircraft and getting carry on luggage out of the over head bins. LFA made the FA prepare doors for arrival announcement was made. LFA did her cabin sweep of any left items and cross checked all doors were not armed.XH:58 Crew called crew services to find out information about ride to hotel; what hotel we are staying in and what our show time is for the next day. Finally got the [hotel] our crew was dead tired. We all just wanted to check in and put our heads on a pillow. The day had used every ounce of energy we had. Once I walked up stairs to my room the hall way smelled as if smoking had been taking place. It didn't smell like cigarettes to me. Being in aviation I wasn't ok with the smell I was smelling just in case I was to get drug tested. I exited the room o,,,,A MD-80 Flight Attendant described crew and passenger behavior following a weather related diversion. After a three hour ground delay with passenger illnesses and unrest the flight taxied to the gate. Later; the flight re-boarded for its original destination.,"The incident involved a weather-related diversion of an MD-80 flight, causing a three-hour ground delay. During the delay, flight attendants managed medical situations, including a passenger experiencing nausea and a claustrophobic episode, while also addressing passenger unrest. Despite challenges with cabin service and communication, the crew eventually re-boarded the aircraft and proceeded to the original destination, ensuring a safe arrival. The flight attendants coordinated with ground staff for hotel arrangements, concluding a taxing day with fatigue.",crew-related issues

I explained that overhead bins were [still] open as the last of the passengers had just entered; and a long line in the aisle was still present. I told her that it was 11 minutes until scheduled departure. I had also informed the gate agents twice during boarding that oversized carry on baggage was entering the aircraft. The agent Supervisor stated that the cargo [bin] had already closed. I told her that we may still have bags to check due to [being] oversized. At that time a bag came to the [forward] galley that was obviously well larger than the bag sizer would allow. The agent Supervisor repeated that the cargo [bin] was closed. I told her we may have additional bags to check. I also told her not to close the aircraft entry door until I could get the overhead bins closed. As soon as I left the immediate area; the agent Supervisor told [another Flight Attendant] that they had to go and proceeded to close the entry door. The FAR for overhead bin was violated. The FAR for stacked luggage in the closet was violated since additional oversized bags were on the plane and the only option was to stack them in the forward closet. The aircraft entry door was closed 5 minutes before scheduled departure time. The event occurred because the agent Supervisor for this flight would not listen to the Purser! This is an ongoing occurrence at this station for this flight.,,I was [on duty as a Flight Attendant] in back of aircraft during boarding assisting passengers and closing overhead bins; working my way forward. I then heard from another Flight Attendant that the boarding door had been closed by the agent before we had all the baggage stored and all overhead bins had been closed. To my best knowledge the agent was in a hurry and closed aircraft door before cabin was ready. The flight attendant in front of aircraft and entrance door is the only one who can deal with the agent because the other flight attendant is in the cabin doing their duties. I had no knowledge that the door had even been closed prematurely. I was closing bins as my duties required.,,Contrary to policy and flight attendant direction; a gate agent closed the cabin door before the cabin was fully prepared.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and a ground personnel supervisor over closing the aircraft door prematurely. The supervisor aimed to close the door 11 minutes before departure, despite the flight attendant's communication that overhead bins were still open and passengers were boarding. The supervisor proceeded to close the door despite the flight attendant's instructions, violating FARs and causing an ongoing issue. The flight attendant highlighted the need for adherence to safety protocols, and the recurring nature of the problem suggests a potential need for improved communication or procedural changes to prevent future occurrences.",crew-related issues

Aircraft resumed taxiing; making lots of turns and stops. The arrival announcements had been done; passengers were complying; by staying seated and bags stowed. The aircraft came to a stop; several bells went off and the seat belt sign was turned off. I made the 'disarm door' announcement; turned the cabin lights to bright and disarmed the 1R. When I was ready to disarm 1L I looked out the door window; I did not see ANYTHING!!! I heard the engine running but that is not unusual. I looked again to see if I had made a mistake and the seat belt sign was actually still on-- NO it wasn't; so I called the flight deck. I asked Captain if we were at the gate. He replied NO and I told him we had gotten several bells and the seat belt sign was off. He turned on the sign; I re-armed my 1R; made an announcement that there was a malfunction with our bell system; we needed everyone to take their seats; [and] we were resuming the taxi. Most of the bags were down already. We closed the overheads. There was no way; or time; to put the bags back; as we were moving again. I felt the passengers being seated were more important; at this moment. We did not have an option to stow bags. It was not a safe situation; if an evacuation had been warranted we would have had a lot of bags going down slides (they wouldn't have had to waste time to get them; they already had them-- a little sarcasm- given the number of bags that came off). Once we did reach our gate; the sign went off again and I made the door disarm announcement. Needless to say; they deplaned quickly because they had all their items ready. Captain was very apologetic; He said there was an aircraft taxiing towards us at one point; he reached up to turn off the nose gear light; and inadvertently hit the 'seat belt sign' switch. When I explained; to him; what had happened in the cabin; he said we did what we could have; given the circumstances. He wouldn't have been able to stop long enough for us to get everything stowed. I can tell you; we held our breath until we were safely at the gate. I might have seen that we were a long way from the terminal if I had looked out the 1R door before disarming it; but that is NOT part of the procedure at that door. When I did look out 1L; which was when I noticed that there were NO lights; and NO terminal. I relied solely on the bells and seat belt sign being turned off. The viewing ports/windows on the Airbus doors - do NOT look out; unless you are bent over looking outside- instead; from a seated position; you see the ground- NOT the surrounding area.,,,,After landing and a lengthy taxi the aircraft is stopped and the seat belt sign is turned off. The Lead Flight Attendant makes the arrival announcement and disarms door 1R before turning to door 1L and discovering the aircraft is not at the gate and the passengers are all standing with their luggage in the aisle. The Captain had inadvertently turned off the seatbelt sign while attempting to turn off the taxi light.,"The incident occurred after the aircraft landed and was taxiing to the gate. The seatbelt sign was inadvertently turned off by the Captain while attempting to adjust the taxi light. This led the cabin crew to believe the aircraft had arrived at the gate. The Lead Flight Attendant instructed passengers to return to their seats and continue moving, as stowing luggage wasn't feasible. Upon reaching the gate, the correct signal was given, allowing a quick deplaning. The crew's prompt action ensured passenger safety despite the initial confusion.",crew-related issues

I explained to him that we do not open the doors from the inside but the caterer could open it from the outside. An Agent Supervisor (a woman in street clothes) came down and insisted that I open the door and I explained again that we do not open doors from the inside. She said that she was calling Inflight [Services].She called me out to the jetway phone and said that when it rang again it would be an Inflight Supervisor. When I answered the Supervisor never asked me what was going on or what the problem was; simply started quoting manual chapters to me. I told her that it is hammered into us all year that we do not open the doors from the inside. She said that I had to open the door. When I objected she said 'SWEETIE I am an Inflight Supervisor.' I then had another Flight Attendant confirm the door was disarmed and I opened it. I was forced to open a door with a large wheelchair sitting in front of the door and leaning out a four story open door with a straight drop to concrete. After I opened the door they discovered that the lift would not even come close to the door opening. Now I was forced to lean out the four story drop again to close the door that should never have been opened. So I had placed myself in danger for nothing.They then did what they should have done in the first place before causing a thirty minute delay and found a way to get it out via the jetway. Our Inflight Manual; section XXXXX says; 'flight attendants are NEVER to open an aircraft door from the inside...that; if there is a problem; they should contact an agent or Maintenance'. If the Inflight Supervisor had asked questions she would have [learned] how dangerous her demands were. If I had bumped the wheelchair in the opening and lost my balance or slipped while reaching outside the aircraft I would have dropped out of the four story opening onto the concrete below and there would have been a dead flight attendant on the tarmac.The Agent Supervisor would not listen to my safety concerns or to other options. The Inflight Supervisor was never interested in knowing what was going on from our safety perspective on the aircraft and never asked any questions about what was happening on the aircraft. They both forced us into putting our own safety in jeopardy for something that was never going to work in the first place. After the flight the woman that owned the chair came and talked to me. When I told her that the Ramp Agent told me that the battery was dead she said that if they had come and asked her she could have told them that [the battery cables] just come loose and she could have come and reconnected it. She was very upset about our treatment of her and her chair. All this happened because both supervisors were not interested in getting all the information before they made decisions and neither gave one moment's concern for the safety of the crew.,,,,An acrimonious exchange resulted when supervisors from passenger boarding and Inflight Service Departments demanded that a Flight Attendant (the reporter) open the A330's 2R cabin level passenger service door from inside the aircraft in direct violation of the company's Flight Attendant's Operations Manual forbidding doing so; the intended reason being to remove a passenger's electric wheel chair from the aircraft to a catering truck and thence to be boarded in cargo. After compelling the Attendant to do so they discovered the lift vehicle intended to remove the chair was unable to access the door opening.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and Ground Personnel over the improper handling of an electric wheelchair on an aircraft. The Ramp Agent requested the Flight Attendant to open the 2R door from the inside to load the wheelchair onto a catering truck, despite company policy prohibiting such actions. The Agent Supervisor and Inflight Supervisor insisted on the door being opened, ignoring the Flight Attendant's safety concerns and explanations that doors should only be opened from the outside. After the door was opened, it was discovered that the lift vehicle intended to remove the wheelchair could not access the door opening, resulting in a thirty-minute delay. The wheelchair owner later expressed frustration, stating that if consulted, she could have resolved the issue without opening the door. The supervisors failed to consider alternative solutions or safety protocols, unnecessarily putting the Flight Attendant at risk. The incident highlights the importance of adhering to safety procedures and consulting all parties before making decisions that compromise safety.",crew-related issues

The flight attendant encountered the odor during preflight and when emptying trash, leading to dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, dry heaves, and vomiting. Despite measures like drinking water and resting, symptoms persisted, prompting notifications to the domicile, supervisor, and union. The union noted previous attempts to halt the practice, and the flight attendant remained off work two weeks later. A proposed solution was to cease using cleaner in the oven.",crew-related issues

I called the Aft Flight Attendant in the aft galley and asked her if her crew oxygen compartment was sealed as well (it was). I brought the issue to the attention of the Captain and told him about my concerns and that I did not believe the seals should be there. After a brief discussion; he said he would make a call and let me know. A few minutes later; the Captain told me that he spoke to Dispatch and they told him to tell me to look in my [Flight Attendant] Manual; that a list of approved locations for security seals would be in there. I told him I didn't think such a list was in the Flight Attendant Binder and asked him if Dispatch mentioned where in my binder it might be. He just repeated his prior statement of 'look in your Manual'.I did as instructed; but after several minutes of searching was unable to locate the list that the Captain had mentioned. It was clear that I was not going to get an answer from the Captain on this issue and that I was 'chasing my own tail' looking in the Manual (for something that's not in there) so I called the (city) Inflight Office and spoke with a Supervisor. I explained the situation; however he did not know the answer; but said that he would call Maintenance and call me back ASAP. I told the Captain that I was unable to locate the list in my Manual and I had called Inflight and told him what the Supervisor was doing. The Captain then proceeded to 'chew me out' saying that any call to Maintenance had to go through him first and that I should not have done it the way I did it. I explained to him that I had in fact brought the issue to his attention first and that he essentially blew me off by telling me to find the answer myself. He kept telling me in an accusatory tone that I should not have called Maintenance without speaking to him first; I repeatedly told him that I did not call them; I only called my Supervisor for an answer because I wasn't getting one from him. The conversation was going nowhere; he was just accusing me; and I felt the need to defend myself; so I just stated one last time '(city) Inflight is calling Maintenance' and left the flight deck. A short time later; the Inflight Supervisor called me back and told me that after speaking with Maintenance he determined that the crew oxygen compartments should NOT be sealed. With the Supervisor on the phone; I relayed that information to the Captain. The Captain then asked to speak with my Supervisor; so I handed him the phone. They spoke briefly; and then he hung up. The Captain then told me that the seals should not be there. I asked him; 'Is Maintenance going to come out and remove them; or should I remove them?' He told me to remove the seals; so I did and brought the seals back to him. He then told me that the 'list' he was referring to was not in my Flight Attendant Manual; and again chastised me for 'not consulting him before calling Maintenance'. At that point; I just wanted to be done with the situation; I was tired of his accusations; so I just said 'ok' and left. Several minutes after we closed the [main] entry door; the Captain called back and told me to re-open the forward entry door. Maintenance came onboard to write something in the logbook. As a result of this situation the flight was delayed by 16-minutes. Maintenance needs to pay very close attention to where they are putting those security seals; they must follow all procedures; and also use some common sense and good judgment when performing tasks. If anyone should have a clear understanding of why those compartments should not be sealed shut; it would be a mechanic. Also pilots in general; and this pilot specifically; need to trust and listen to the concerns of their flight attendants. Crewmember's safety related concerns should NEVER be blown off like mine were; no matter how busy you might be.,Reporter stated that when he came onboard a large transport aircraft; the forward and aft flight attendant jumpseat overhead oxygen masks compartments were taped over with company security seals. As far as he knows; the aircraft had flown all day with the O2 mask compartments sealed up. But taping over and restricting automatic deployment of flight attendant oxygen mask compartments at the forward and aft jumpseat locations would result in all three flight attendants not having oxygen available to them; especially during a sudden cabin depressurization. He did not believe there would be enough time for any of the flight attendants to get to a Personal Oxygen Bottle (POB).Not only was there a serious potential for all three flight attendants to become incapacitated; but assisting with any passenger emergency or implementing cabin procedures could also be impacted.,,,A Flight Attendant reports having conflict with a Captain over the cabin crew oxygen mask compartments at the forward and aft flight attendant jumpseat positions on their large transport aircraft having been taped over with security seals.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the captain regarding the presence of security seals on the cabin crew oxygen mask compartments above the forward and aft jumpseats. The flight attendant noticed the compartments were sealed and raised concerns with the captain, who initially instructed her to consult the Flight Attendant Manual for a list of approved locations for the seals. After failing to locate the list, the flight attendant contacted the inflight office supervisor, who then reached out to maintenance. The captain became upset, accusing the flight attendant of contacting maintenance without consulting him first. Despite the flight attendant's clarification that she had sought resolution through proper channels, the captain reprimanded her. Following further communication, maintenance confirmed that the compartments should not be sealed, and the flight attendant removed the seals. The captain reiterated his disapproval, and the flight experienced a 16-minute delay. The incident highlighted the need for maintenance to adhere to proper procedures and for the captain to consider flight attendants' safety concerns more carefully.",crew-related issues

Called Maintenance as the IFE Contractor had put an entry in the logbook as accomplished work card 23-32-00 (ops check system normal). RJAA Maintenance arrived at the gate and I asked him if he could remove the system placard. He called the IFE Technician to the plane who then told me that the system worked but needed further troubleshooting. Logbook items 12; 13; 14 & 16 all addressed parts of the IFE system. Local Maintenance did not clear the IFE placard. Per the MEL 23-10 and NEF 23-33b; I instructed the Purser not to use the IFE system for any of the required passenger safety briefings; or other pre-recorded announcements. After departure; I was made aware that the IFE system was used for the passenger safety demo. Apparently; the Purser decided to use the system after being instructed by me (Captain) not to use this equipment.  AFTER GATE ARRIVAL THE PURSER CAME TO COCKPIT; I DISCUSSED WITH HER THE VIOLATION OF POLICY AND POSSIBLE FAR'S REGARDING USE OF AN AIRCRAFT SYSTEM THAT WAS ON MEL PLACARD; AND THAT THE FINAL AUTHORITY FOR OPERATION OF COMPANY EQUIPMENT RESTS WITH THE CAPTAIN DESIGNATED ON THE FLIGHT RELEASE.  SHE TOLD ME THAT THE MECHANICS; AS THEY LEFT THE AIRCRAFT IN TOKYO; TOLD HER THE SYSTEM WAS FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND TO USE IT.  I POINTED OUT THAT THE CAPTAIN HAS THE LAST SAY REGARDING USE OF EQUIPMENT ON COMPANY AIRCRAFT AND THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE COORDINATED WHAT SHE BELIEVED PROPER USE WITH THE CAPTAIN AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY TOLD HER SPECIFICALLY NOT TO USE THE PRE-RECORDED PORTION OF THE IFE SYSTEM AS IT WAS PLACARDED INOP.,,Captain reviewed the logbook items and spoke to both the Narita Mechanic and two tech reps about the issue. [Captain] then declared that the IFE system would not be used by crew. In the course of the flight; it was discovered that the cabin crew made an attempt to utilize the IFE system which proved unsuccessful. Considering the consequences of an MD-11 accident and other experiences with IFE malfunctions and fires; adherence to Captain's directive needs to trump cabin crew intuition. Additionally; MEL/CDL/NEF guidance concerning placarding is vague and needs to be reduced to plain language with the mutual consent of the company and the FAA. This is the second time I've witnessed a problem involving crews and Maintenance personnel not understanding placarding procedures. This entire situation might've been averted if placarding guidance had clearly stated that an INOP sticker needed to be placed on the ON/OFF switch at the IFE control console.Remind cabin crew of Captain's authority. Simplify guidance for installing INOP stickers for MEL/CDU/NEF items; particularly those in the cabin.,,B777 Captain is informed after the fact that the Purser attempted to use the IFE system for passenger briefing after being advised that it was inoperative on MEL and not to be used.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and the flight attendant regarding the use of an inoperative In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) system on a B777 aircraft. The IFE system was placarded as inoperative (MEL 23-10) and the captain had instructed the purser not to use it for passenger safety briefings or other pre-recorded announcements. Despite this directive, the purser attempted to use the system during the safety briefing, believing it was functional based on communication with maintenance personnel. After the flight, the captain addressed the issue with the purser, emphasizing the captain's authority as the final decision-maker regarding the use of company equipment. The purser argued that maintenance had indicated the system was functional. The captain stressed the importance of adhering to MEL directives and the potential risks associated with using unapproved systems, referencing past incidents involving IFE malfunctions. The incident highlighted a gap in understanding of placarding procedures, with the captain proposing that guidance on MEL/CDL/NEF placarding should be simplified and standardized, particularly for systems in the cabin. Additionally, the captain recommended ensuring cabin crew awareness of the captain's authority and the importance of coordinating with the flight deck before using systems that are placarded inoperative. The B777 captain discovered that the purser had attempted to use the inoperative IFE system for passenger safety briefings despite being explicitly instructed not to do so. The purser believed the system was functional based on communication with maintenance. The captain emphasized the importance of adhering to MEL directives and clarified their authority as the final decision-maker. The incident underscored the need for clearer guidance on placarding procedures and cabin crew coordination with the flight deck.",crew-related issues

The other Aft Flight Attendant called the flight deck and spoke to the Captain and asked him to turn on the seatbelt sign; as we were unstable in the rear of the aircraft. The Captain said 'no' and refused to turn on the seatbelt sign. Both aft flight attendants were shocked at his response. She hung up the phone; not knowing what to say at this point. It was at this time a passenger was exiting the most rear lavatory. She had to hang on to the assist handle as she could not make it back to her seat. I then called the Captain; introduced myself and said; 'Captain this is the back. I don't think you are aware of how bumpy it is back here. Could you please turn on the seatbelt sign?' He then answered; 'I am in control of the seatbelt sign and I am not turning it on.' I then said; 'Are you kidding?' I thought he was being sarcastic and could not believe that he was questioning our judgment. Both aft flight attendants could not understand or believe his response. We then notified the Purser of what had taken place. I then talked with a deadheading pilot who was seated in the last seat position 'F.' I asked him if I was being unreasonable and how best to communicate with this pilot. He was also shocked at this pilot's response to our request. We considered our own safety needs and did not start the service until we felt comfortable. During the service; while it was perfectly smooth; the Captain came on the PA and asked the flight attendants to be seated. Both aft flight attendants looked at each other as we could not believe what he was asking. When we got to the rear galley; we stowed the carts and sat in our jumpseats. We called the Purser to find out what was going on. The Captain had not communicated anything to her prior and it was only after she called him; he mentioned there might be turbulence up ahead. We sat for approximately 15 minutes with NO turbulence. Both aft flight attendants felt that this pilot was not concerned with our well being and/or safety; or the passengers. This is a safety issue and our respect for this Captain was lost when he gave the response he did. We also then did not trust him or his judgment throughout the flight and was actually contemplating that he was purposely being erratic and irresponsible. His behavior conveyed a complete lack of concern for our safety and our passenger's safety. I would feel extremely uncomfortable ever flying with this Captain again.,,,,A A320 Aft Flight Attendant asked the Captain during turbulance to turn the seat belt sign ON; but he refused. When asked a second time by the Lead Flight Attendant he responded 'I am in control and not turning it on.' The crew was in disbelief and distrusting.,"The incident occurred during a flight involving an A320 aircraft. Approximately 15-20 minutes after takeoff, moderate turbulence was experienced in the rear of the aircraft. The Aft Flight Attendant requested the Captain to turn on the seatbelt sign due to the instability, but the Captain refused, stating, ""I am in control of the seatbelt sign and I am not turning it on."" The flight attendant, along with the other Aft Flight Attendant, expressed disbelief and concern over the Captain's response, feeling it disregarded their safety and that of the passengers. The flight attendants deferred to a deadheading pilot for guidance, who also expressed shock at the Captain's refusal. Fearing for their safety, the flight attendants delayed service until conditions stabilized. Later, the Captain instructed the flight attendants to sit down via the public address system, despite the absence of turbulence at the time. The flight attendants felt the Captain's actions demonstrated a lack of concern for their safety and the passengers', leading to a loss of respect and trust in his judgment. The flight attendants considered the behavior a serious safety issue and stated they would feel uncomfortable flying with the Captain again. No resolution was explicitly proposed in the incident.",crew-related issues

Discussed the light with the Captain and because of the likelihood of a long delay in ZZZ; we elected to come to ZZZ1 and report the light 'On'. In ZZZ1; Maintenance found enough debris that the aircraft was removed from service to flush the oil system and recheck for debris. [Contributors]:1) There is no guidance for the flight crew regarding the chip detector. It is not part of the normal preflight inspection but the light is obvious if 'On'. Without guidance there is confusion as to whether this is something we should check or even be concerned about if it is 'On'. 2) The most common time to find this light 'On'; is during the first flight of the day preflight which is usually at an outstation. Due to the difficulty of getting Maintenance to the Outstation and the likelihood of a lengthy delay; it is difficult to convince myself; much less the Captain; that we should report the problem at the Outstation. This is the second time in the last two months I have delayed reporting the light 'On' to avoid delay at the Outstation. This is the first time out of six previous that required more than a simple cleaning of the detector. [Recommend that] clear guidelines for how the flight crew should react to the chip detector being 'On'; would prevent this in the future!,,,,A First Officer reports departing with the Left-Hand (LH) Chip Detector Light illuminated on their CRJ-200 aircraft. Maintenance at a downline Station found enough debris in chip detector to remove aircraft from service. Pilot noted that unclear guidance on chip detector light and on-time departure pressures were contributors.,"The incident involved a First Officer who reported that the Left-Hand (LH) Chip Detector Light was illuminated during the preflight inspection of their CRJ-200 aircraft. After discussing the issue with the Captain, they decided to divert to ZZZ1 due to concerns about potential delays at the outstation. Upon arrival, Maintenance discovered sufficient debris in the chip detector, leading to the aircraft being removed from service for oil system flushing and reinspection. Contributors to the incident included the lack of clear guidelines for flight crew regarding the chip detector light, which is not part of the standard preflight inspection. The First Officer noted that the light frequently illuminated during the first flight of the day at outstations, and the difficulty of obtaining timely Maintenance support at remote locations compounded the decision to delay reporting. This was the second occurrence in two months, with the first five instances requiring only a simple cleaning of the detector. To prevent future occurrences, the First Officer recommended the establishment of clear guidelines for flight crew actions when the chip detector light is illuminated, aiming to address confusion and reduce the risk of similar incidents.",crew-related issues

The clearance consisted of 'Taxi to Runway 4R' via Bravo and Juliette. After receiving the clearance; and prior to taxi; I confirmed with the First Officer and verified the taxi clearance with the airport diagram. We started moving straight ahead via Bravo and momentarily stopped on 4L to do our normal safety visual clearance (Left and Right) and then; continued taxi toward Juliette. After reaching Juliette; and turning right; we stopped before crossing Runway 11. When we stopped; we received a call from Ground Control with a possible Pilot deviation; and they also gave us a phone number to contact them. After the call; we received clearance to cross Runway 11 and continue Taxi to 4R. At the end of the runway; on the holding short area; I called the Tower. They informed me that we crossed 4L without clearance.We never had the intention to cross any active runway. However; with the clearance that we received (and verified with the airport diagram); we understood that we were clear to taxi all the way to 4R; including crossing the Runways (4L and 11). Apparently; my First Officer misunderstood the taxi clearance because; usually the normal taxi clearance instructions are 'Taxi Runway 4R via Bravo and hold short Runway 4L.' After that; we usually receive further clearance.  In my opinion; since Juliette Taxiway is at the end of Bravo; and prior to Juliette is Runway 4L; when we received the clearance instructions the way we got them; it became confusing and created an involuntary error. Again; we understood; we were cleared to taxi to Runway 4R; via Bravo and Juliette.,,,,An air carrier crew cleared to LFT Runway 4R taxied all the way to the Runway crossing Runway 4L but stopping prior to Runway 11 because they thought the taxi clearance included crossing intervening runways.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) at Lafayette Airport. The flight attendant reported receiving taxi clearance to Runway 4R via Bravo and Juliette. After confirming the clearance with the first officer and referencing the airport diagram, the crew began taxiing. They momentarily stopped on Runway 4L for safety checks and continued toward Juliette. Upon reaching Juliette and turning right, they stopped before crossing Runway 11 and received a call from Ground Control regarding a possible deviation. Ground Control provided a phone number and later cleared the crew to cross Runway 11 and proceed to Runway 4R. Upon reaching the holding short area, the Tower informed the crew that they had crossed Runway 4L without clearance. The flight attendant stated that the crew had intended to follow the taxi clearance as understood, which they believed included crossing intervening runways. The flight attendant attributed the misunderstanding to the taxi clearance instructions, which they claimed were ambiguous and different from the usual format (""Taxi Runway 4R via Bravo and hold short Runway 4L""). The first officer reportedly misapplied the instructions, leading to the unintended crossing of Runway 4L. The crew ultimately followed the corrected instructions and resolved the situation without further incident.",crew-related issues

The toilet paper holder was missing, and toilet paper was left on the sink counter. The ground crew, wearing hazmat suits, conducted a clean-up but failed to remove the aft galley carts, allowing toilet water to seep under them. This resulted in additional overflow during taxi and takeoff, saturating the cabin flooring, carpets under rows 23-25, and the aft galley.

After the [onboard] services; the crews have been putting aluminum cans in the New Tech electrical [food] carts. When I made this known to the [more experienced] flight attendant crews; the response was negative and I quote that their response is 'This is what we have always done.' I am considered a Junior Flight Attendant. The carts have shown malfunction from the collaboration of the aluminum and electrical appliances. If abused it can cause other malfunctions to the electrical system(s) of the aircraft. ALL New Tech Carts hold HEAT!!!! When aluminum is introduced to the hot electrical plates it can cause an explosion. I was told that they do it because they are not going to plug the carts back up to the electrical [cord.] But what happens when the next crew uses the carts? The [residue] cannot be washed away. I believe that is what they think; or burned away using the integrity of the airplanes electrical heating systems. AGAIN; this has been practiced numerous times. My response is I am not stupid to the following working crew. And they wonder why we have mechanical problems with the planes. The [aluminum] can explode if they continue to practice this method [or] attitude.,Reporter stated the New Tech Carts can chill or heat food. Switches for the cooling or heating of carts are located at the Galley's upper panel. Only the Aft Galley on their B747's currently use the New Tech Carts. An electrical cord from each cart is connected to another cord supplying electrical power for heat or cold. Older carts were either chiller or hot carts; not both.Reporter stated her concern was the potential for the used aluminum cans to melt on the heating pads and releasing mercury or some other fumes. Heating pads are believed to be made of a ceramic/metal material. Another concern was the lack of training for many of the flight attendants who just don't understand how the New Tech Cart's function. Many times she has found flight attendants trying to heat food while they also had the chiller switch 'On' and complaining the heater was not working. Reporter noted she has nineteen years flying experience.,,,A Flight Attendant describes the potential for electrical malfunctions caused by stowage of empty aluminum cans in the New Tech Cart food trays and the lack of training for the proper operation of the carts on B747-400 aircraft.,"The incident involved a conflict between two flight attendants regarding the improper storage of empty aluminum cans in the New Tech electrical carts used for heating and cooking meals on a B747-400 aircraft. The junior flight attendant reported that storing aluminum cans in the carts could lead to electrical malfunctions, explosions, or residue buildup that might harm future operations. Despite their concerns, the more experienced flight attendants dismissed the issue, stating it was a longstanding practice. The junior attendant emphasized the safety risks and lack of proper training on the aircraft's electrical systems, expressing frustration over what they perceived as unsafe habits contributing to mechanical issues. The incident highlighted a potential safety hazard and called for improved training on the proper use of the carts.",crew-related issues

When I answered I received a very loud and frantic voice repeating this 'XXXX; XXXX; we must land immediately.' I tried to gain more information to no avail. I declared an emergency and asked for a return to the airport. When asked what the nature of the emergency was; I stated that is was unclear; however; it could be a fire type of situation. During the 180 degree turn back we received a second chime and got the same verbiage from the flight attendants. 'XXXX; XXXX; we must land immediately.' Soon thereafter I took the control of the airplane and radios and asked the First Officer to get more information from the back. We eventually found out that is was an ill passenger who was having a heart attack and CPR was being administered. I then stated to ATC what type of emergency we had and entered a downwind for the landing runway.The phrase 'XXXX' is mentioned one time in our operations manual. It is a Flight Attendant to Flight Attendant reference only. Simple English; with details; need to be used when describing a situation in the cabin of the airplane. Due to the severity of the ill passenger (heart attack; no pulse; no breathing and CPR being done) the flight attendants were under a lot of stress. They performed very well and I would like to acknowledge they probably saved this mans life! GREAT JOB! However; I feel there needs to be much more awareness of the fact that we are not privy to or trained in some of their references; acronyms etc. My perception of what was maybe a fire or other [question of airworthiness] type of situation; even though for a very short time; is very concerning due to the [lack of specificity] from the flight attendants.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger had a heart attack shortly after takeoff; an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.

While walking down the jet bridge the inbound crew informed the four of us flight attendants that we have a mechanical.  They discovered a missing portion of the Emergency Lighting strip on the floor by Row-12 and wrote it up.  They said that it is a 'No-Go' item.  When I boarded the B757-200 airplane; I immediately went to Row-12 to see the missing lighting strip.  It was plain to see that the strip was missing.  My three flying partners all saw it as well and noted it's nothing we have ever seen before. Soon a Maintenance employee was on board examining the area.  I walked up to him and started a discussion about the missing strip. He began to explain to me how the lighting strip is NOT missing; that merely the portion of carpet in that area is what's missing.  I was quite surprised by his explanation and assertively shared my complete disagreement for his assessment.  How; if the pilots were to turn on the emergency lighting that the missing portion would not light up at all; and that is not normal.  To further prove my point I told him I was going to ask the pilots to turn on the lighting so he could see for himself.  I then walked up to the cockpit and asked the Captain if they could turn on the emergency lights so he could walk back with me and also tell the Mechanic that the missing portion does in fact exist and that it is not normal.  Captain then instructed the First Officer to turn on the lighting so he could walk back with me to see the missing lighting strip. When the emergency lights were on; the lighting strip went from a lit strip to dark carpet by Row-12 then to a lit strip again.  I motioned to both the Mechanic and Captain how that is not 'normal' and it's a safety issue.  The Mechanic dismissed my comment as he continued with his explanation to the Captain how the plane is DESIGNED this way.  I was astounded.  I assertively stated that the incoming crew knew this wasn't normal; which is why they wrote it up.  I and my three flying partners have never seen a missing lighting strip before and knew it wasn't normal; and now I'm to believe that Boeing designed their 757s with a missing lighting strip by Row 12?!  The Captain said if the Mechanic is okay with it; then he is too.  I took a picture of the missing portion by Row-12 (and happened to get the Captains feet in the picture.)  The Mechanic left the plane and came back about ten minutes later.  When he returned he told me that he went to a nearby gate where another B757 [aircraft] was parked and examined Row-12 on that plane and how that plane also had the same missing strip by Row-12.  He showed pictures of that planes missing strip as well.  I responded by telling the Mechanic that simply because another plane has a missing strip that doesn't necessarily mean it's normal and doesn't need to be addressed and/or fixed.  How again the inbound crew knew to report it; how the current crew knows it's not normal and how I'm not okay with it missing due to it being a safety issue. Although I don't have Captain's authority to make a final decision about it; yet I made it known my own level of discomfort with it as it's an obvious potential safety issue.  If we had to evacuate upon landing in ZZZ1; that area [of the cabin floor] would not have lit up; especially since we landed late at night. To further my correct stance on this issue; we worked on another B757 the following day out of ZZZ1.  The four of us flight attendants were quick to notice a fully intact lighting strip by Row-12 on this plane.  We also happened to have the same cockpit crew Captain and First Officer.  I told the Captain that this plane does have the lighting strip by Row-12; how the plane is not designed to have a missing portion of the strip and that it should have been fixed on our plane yesterday.  I did not receive a receptive response.I cannot help but feel that our safety was not a priority on this flight.  Either the Mechanic didn't want to fix the missing strip or he somehow knew that they didn't have a replacement to fix the strip which would have caused a significant delay or potential cancellation of my flight.  Regardless; no excuse should be given for allowing this plane to fly the manner in which it did. I felt as though my opinion didn't matter; didn't count and wasn't professionally regarded with the priority it should have been given.  If safety is our Air Carrier's number one corporate value; they fell very short with me and my crew and all the passengers on this flight. Worked First Class [section].,,,,A Flight Attendant working as a Purser; describes her efforts to address cabin egress safety issues after being informed that a section of the cabin floor Emergency Lighting strip was missing on their outbound B757 aircraft.,"The incident involved a Purser on a flight from ZZZ-ZZZ1 who was informed by the inbound crew about a missing portion of the Emergency Lighting strip in Row-12, classified as a 'No-Go' item. Upon boarding, she confirmed the missing strip, which her crew also deemed unusual. She discussed the issue with a maintenance employee, who claimed the carpet was missing instead of the lighting strip. The Purser demonstrated the safety risk by having the pilots activate the emergency lights, revealing a dark area where the strip was missing. Despite her evidence, the mechanic and captain dismissed her concerns, with the captain deferring to the mechanic. The Purser took a photo and later found another B757 with the same issue. She argued that the problem warranted attention but felt her concerns were disregarded. The next day, on a different B757 with an intact strip, she again highlighted the inconsistency, but her feedback was not addressed. She expressed dissatisfaction with the handling of the issue, feeling her safety concerns were overlooked, and questioned the prioritization of safety.",crew-related issues

Flight attendants thus are precluded from making their pre-landing checks of passenger compliance with safety regulations. The reporter believes the result is aircraft landing unsecured as passengers continue to utilize electronic devices and leave tray tables down; contrary to regulations.,"The incident involved a disagreement between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding safety protocols during expected turbulence. The flight attendant raised concerns that the practice of seating flight attendants early during pre-flight, while allowing passengers to continue using onboard WiFi until descending through 10,000 feet, violated company policy and Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs). The flight attendant argued that this practice prevented them from conducting necessary pre-landing safety checks, potentially leaving the cabin unsecured upon landing. The flight attendant noted that passengers' tray tables remained down and electronic devices were in use, which could obstruct an evacuation in the event of an emergency.

Nothing was ever said to me about Air Marshals on the flight. This flight had FAA Inspector on board; who works in the Certificate Management Office. The problem began when the agent started the boarding process without consulting with the flight attendants. Passengers arrived at the airplane; catching the flight attendants off guard. The FAA Inspector actually held the passengers on the jet bridge while the flight attendants scrambled to prepare the airplane. FAA Inspector apparently confronted the ticket agent and; according to the Inspector; the ticket agent copped an attitude. A few minutes later an armed FBI agent appeared at the cockpit door to show me his ID. I had no paper work on the individual and he said the ticket agent had my copy of the paper work. A few minutes later a DEA agent arrived at the airplane; and this time the ticket agent had sent my paper work with the DEA agent. I asked the DEA agent if he was aware of the Air Marshals and the FBI agent that were also on the flight; and he said he knew about the FBI agent; but not the Air Marshals. I immediately called for a supervisor to come to the plane. I explained the situation to the supervisor and he apologized for the mix up and said he would take care of the issue. A few minutes later another ticket agent came into the cockpit and I asked if the LEOs had met the Air Marshals. He said there were no Air Marshals on board. Then the original ticket agent came to the cockpit and I asked him if there were any Air Marshals on board. He said 'no'. One of the ticket agents went back to the gate counter and returned to the airplane a few minutes later and told me there were indeed two Air Marshals on board. Knowing that the two LEO's did not know of the Air Marshals; I instructed the ticket agent to inform all four armed individuals of each other. (Which he did). The flight departed 13 minutes late with no further issues. FAA Inspector said he would be investigating the events on this flight which has prompted me to submit this report.,,,,Armed Federal Agents and Law Enforcement Officers boarded aircraft without proper notification to the crew and or knowledge of each others presence.,"An incident occurred when multiple armed federal agents boarded a flight without prior notification to the crew, resulting in confusion and a delayed departure. The agents included an FAA Inspector, FBI agent, DEA agent, and two Air Marshals. The boarding process began without consulting the flight attendants, who were unprepared, causing a delay as passengers were held on the jet bridge. Communication issues led to the flight attendant being unaware of all law enforcement personnel initially. After an FBI agent and DEA agent arrived, the flight attendant sought a supervisor, who apologized and resolved the confusion by informing all agents of each other's presence. The flight departed 13 minutes late, with the FAA Inspector initiating an investigation.",crew-related issues

He said that this would be a normal landing and I rephrased it as a question 'we should prepare the cabin for a normal landing?' and his answer was; 'Yes.' The call ended shortly after. The airplane began to descend shortly after an announcement to the passengers from the pilots. The landing gear was extended much earlier than usual before landing. Upon landing a number of fire personnel met the aircraft off the runway. Although emergency fire personnel were in the jet bridge; the passengers deplaned normally. Shortly after landing the pilots went below the aircraft to inspect something under the wing. [Since I was] not being given much information; I discussed the event with the fire and Maintenance personnel. The issue they described was much more severe in nature than I was told on the aircraft. According to Maintenance the light/message that came on indicated the possible loss of critical aircraft systems and could have been catastrophic if failure did occur on landing. This incident indicated serious problems on the aircraft that sounded; to me; like an emergency; i.e. 'Any event in which the safe operation of the flight is in doubt.' When the pilots returned from inspecting the aircraft I asked; 'What were you looking at?' The Captain replied; 'Nothing.' There was no official debriefing after the event by the Captain. The First Officer did try to inform us about what occurred; but the Captain seemed to be keeping him from speaking with us. After the event the pilots had a couple of extensive private conversations in the back of the aircraft when the only other people onboard were the other Flight Attendant and me. The failure here on the part of the Captain is addressed in our Flight Attendant Manual (FAM). 'The PIC will ensure the flight attendants are advised as to the extent of the emergency or irregular operation.' None of the SOP briefing items were discussed and they should have been as this was; at the very least; an abnormal situation. The time between the Captain's call to me and our landing would have been more than sufficient to prepare the cabin for an abnormal landing. As stated in our manual; 'In an emergency; flight attendants are responsible for ensuring the safety of the passengers and preserving the integrity of the cabin.' With the information provided and the attitude of the Captain appearing to discourage communication; I did not feel I could do so. There was a critical failure of the communication process between crew members of this event. There was a lack of CRM during this abnormal/emergency situation. Throughout the whole beginning of the trip the Captain acted like it was a large strain to communicate with us and that attitude extended into this emergency situation in the air. The cabin crew and passengers were given identical sets of information over the PA and even the experienced fliers onboard knew something was not right. I had quite a few people ask me directly; 'We could tell the pilot was lying; what really happened?' and my honest answer was that I was not given any other information.,,,,A Flight Attendant aboard an ERJ-170 reported the Captain failed to properly brief and prepare the aircraft for what the reporter later determined had been a possibly serious anomaly for which the flight diverted to a nearby airport where they were met by CFR and maintenance personnel.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant aboard an ERJ-170 who reported that the Captain failed to properly brief and prepare the cabin crew for an emergency situation. The flight was diverted to a nearby airport due to a message alert indicating a potential loss of critical aircraft systems, which could have been catastrophic. Despite the severity of the situation, the Captain provided insufficient information to the cabin crew, did not follow standard operating procedures (SOP) for emergencies, and appeared to discourage communication with the flight attendants. This led to a breakdown in communication and a lack of Crew Resource Management (CRM) during the abnormal situation. After landing, maintenance personnel revealed that the issue was more severe than initially communicated. The Captain's failure to debrief the cabin crew and the First Officer's apparent restraint from sharing information further exacerbated the situation. The Flight Attendant noted that the lack of transparency and poor communication strained the crew's ability to ensure passenger safety and maintain cabin integrity.",crew-related issues

I say what for I am not on reserve. I also say; how can I do that we are ready to leave the main cabin door is closed. The Captain states it is OK we are now on maintenance. I changed positions with B and retrieve my phone and turn it on even though the entire cabin has their phones off. Crew Scheduling stated there had been a change to my scheduling. I tell them that I am not on reserve. They say they know that. I tell them I won't do it. We continue to talk and then I ask for the Supervisor of Crew Scheduling. The Supervisor tells me tells me there is no one else; I am within duty regulations at that I need to do this. I tell her we are on maintenance and to get a reserve out there as we are now waiting for Maintenance to arrive and take the flight. I request to speak to a Duty Officer. The Duty Officer is unable to speak with me as now we are leaving. I listen to the Duty Officer message after landing asking me please; to save the flight for these people. There is a huge lack of communication. Upon arrival there is an injured Flight Attendant in a wheelchair. Against my own better judgment I do the flight. We landed after midnight. During the flight I truly realize that I am not safe to do the flight. I am exhausted over the turbulence and sleep deprivation. Flight Attendant B who was in the previous turbulence that downed the aircraft states that her neck is stiff and that she probably should not have flown the flight either. I felt pushed by the Company to take one for the team knowing it was not a safe situation for me.,,,,A Q400 Flight Attendant felt forced to work an additional flight after her normal sequence because of another flight attendant's injury but realized later that she was fatigued to the point of not being safe.,"A Q400 flight attendant was pressured by the airline to work an additional flight after her normal sequence concluded due to another flight attendant's injury. Despite expressing exhaustion and fatigue, including concerns about safety during turbulence and sleep deprivation, the attendant felt compelled to fulfill the duty, citing a lack of communication and support from the company. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and support systems to ensure crew safety and prevent similar situations in the future.",crew-related issues

We followed the appropriate procedures and declared an emergency with ATC and landed the aircraft successfully. During the Flight Attendant briefing I informed them of the condition of the aircraft and the time remaining to landing; however; I missed a couple of items. Specifically I should have given them a better brief on what to expect once we landed and after the aircraft came to a stop.After landing I announced 'Flight Attendants to their stations'. Some time later; only after CFR had inspected the aircraft; did I then announce that they should 'Remain Seated' as we taxied to the gate.After I gave the emergency brief in flight; I turned the cabin volume control down. I thought I turned it down all the way; but I did not. After the aircraft came to a stop I could hear the conversation between Flight Attendants. It sounded like they were confused about being on the runway and what was taking so long for further instructions from me. I was concerned that they would evacuate the aircraft with so much time not hearing from the flight deck once the airplane was on the ground. Overhearing what sounded like confused conversation between them I decided that; if there is a next time; I will give a more detailed brief to the Flight Attendants on what to expect on the ground.,,,,An A319 Captain discussed what he believed to be his incomplete briefing given to the Flight Attendants to prepare them for what would happen after landing when he had declared an emergency due to faulty flaps/slats. He cited his failure to keep them regularly informed as to their status and the progress of exterior inspections by CFR personnel.,"The incident involved an A319 flight where the flight crew declared an emergency due to a flap/slat fault during approach. The captain successfully landed the aircraft but acknowledged providing an incomplete briefing to the flight attendants regarding the post-landing procedures and the status of exterior inspections by ground personnel. After landing, the captain instructed the flight attendants to return to their stations but did not immediately inform them to remain seated until the aircraft was safely taxied to the gate. The captain later realized that the cabin volume control had not been fully turned down, allowing him to overhear the flight attendants' confused conversations about the delay in receiving further instructions. This led the captain to recognize the need for a more detailed briefing in the future to ensure the flight attendants were better prepared for such situations.",crew-related issues

After the Lead Flight Attendant made his announcements; I thought I heard him say 'prepare doors.' I did so and began walking up the aisle checking on passengers. At this time; I realized that the front entry door and cockpit doors remained open. I proceeded to walk forward to inquire. When I arrived to the forward galley; a caterer came from the rear of the aircraft and informed us that he had popped the slide. We inquired if he was injured; and he said no. I followed him to the aft galley as he told me that he had seen the orange strap; but that his sunglasses had been giving off a glare and he had opened the door anyway. The slide had been fully deployed and was facing upward at an angle as the door was only partially opened. The gate agent; the caterer; and I placed the slide inside the aft galley so the plane could be taken to another gate and a new plane brought to our current gate. We immediately contacted the Captain and began to secure another aircraft; deplane passengers; and continue our flight. The entire procedure was done effectively and efficiently and we departed less than 50 minutes late and all connections were good.I am eternally thankful that no one was injured due to my misunderstanding and know in the future I will be on high alert and double check myself. In this job; there are so many things going on at once in an attempt to board passengers; stow their bags; do our duties and depart on time. Sometimes; I get caught up in repetitive routines like simply shutting the doors and preparing for the demo that I have neglected a very important aspect. I should have immediately returned to the aft galley and 'unprepared' my doors as soon as I saw the forward entry door was open. As for the caterer; thankfully he was not injured; however; I would hope in the future he will never attempt to open a door with the strap across the window.,,,,An emergency exit slide was deployed at the gate by a caterer when a Flight Attendant incorrectly understood the order to arm the doors had been given.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant misunderstood an order to arm the doors, leading to an emergency exit slide being deployed at the gate by a caterer. The Flight Attendant believed they had heard the Lead Flight Attendant instruct to ""prepare doors"" and proceeded to check the cabin. Upon reaching the forward galley, they discovered the front entry door and cockpit doors were open. A caterer approached and explained that they had intentionally opened the forward entry door, mistaking the orange safety strap for a signal to deploy the slide due to sunglass glare. The slide was fully deployed and facing upward, creating an obstruction. The Flight Attendant, along with the caterer and gate agent, secured the slide, moved the aircraft to another gate, and coordinated with ground staff to bring a replacement aircraft. Passengers were deplaned, and the flight resumed less than 50 minutes after the initial delay. No injuries were reported, and the situation was handled efficiently. The Flight Attendant acknowledged the importance of double-checking procedures and expressed gratitude for the positive outcome. The caterer was unharmed but was advised against such actions in the future.",crew-related issues

Normal departure out of TEB [and] at 1;000 FT AGL engaged the autopilot. Autopilot flew the SID properly [and] leveled off 1;500 FT on a 240 degree heading. Autopilot turned aircraft towards 280 degree heading; but failed to stop and continued another 20-30 degrees. I disconnected autopilot immediately to turn back to 280 degree heading. At the same time ATC instructed us to expedite climb to 6;000 FT. My First Officer answered the call and I began to climb. In the same transmission ATC also instructed us to turn right direct to BREZY. My First Officer responded to that and directed the FMS to take us to BREZY. As we made the turn and climb; ATC questioned us as to where we were going and [told us] that we should be on a 280 degree heading. I immediately turned back to 280 degrees. My First Officer responded; 'You gave us direct to BREZY.' ATC responded that he was sorry he missed the incorrect read back and not to worry; it was his mistake. He said he had asked us to expedite the climb and to 'expect a right turn direct BREZY.' A contributing factor to the miscommunication was the busyness of the frequency workload on the Controller; the aural warning of the autopilot disconnect causing additional noise in the headset for my First Officer; as well as the FMS and autopilot incorrectly flying the SID. A corrective action would be for ATC not to accept an incorrect read back in such a crucial phase of flight. I will [also] hand fly the SID form now on. Discouraging as it is; I will not trust the approved FMS and autopilot to actually fly the SID. Had this situation not occurred at this inopportune time; both my First Officer and I would have taken a moment to question the instructions given.,,,,PC12 Captain experiences an autopilot malfunction during the TEB 6 departure; resulting in a track deviation. A second deviation occurs when the crew is told to expect direct BREZY and reads back cleared direct BREZY.,"The incident involved an autopilot malfunction during the departure of a PC12 aircraft from TEB, leading to a track deviation. The autopilot failed to stop at the correct heading, prompting the captain to disconnect it. Subsequently, the crew received ATC instructions to expedite climb and turn right direct to BREZY. However, the crew incorrectly read back the instructions as ""cleared direct to BREZY,"" which ATC later acknowledged was their mistake due to workload and miscommunication. Contributing factors included the controller's busy frequency, the autopilot's aural warning causing headset noise, and the FMS and autopilot's incorrect handling of the SID. As a result, the captain decided to hand-fly the SID in the future, distrusting the FMS and autopilot. ATC was advised to avoid accepting incorrect readbacks during critical phases of flight.",crew-related issues

The aircraft also had one MEL; the APU was inoperative; so we had to do an external air start at the gate. While taxiing to the runway; we performed a cross bleed start on the number one engine. Everything was normal during the taxi; beside the aircraft getting warm while using the bleed air to operate the air conditioning packs.We were in the takeoff roll; well past 80 KTS and approaching V1 when we received a call chime from the Flight Attendant. I was the pilot flying and decided to continue the takeoff; as we were within a few KTS of V1. While I was rotating the aircraft; we received a second call from the Flight Attendant using the cabin emergency call button. After raising the gear and configuring the aircraft; the First Officer answered the call. She said; 'There's smoke in the cabin; down the floor aisle.' We immediately informed Tower of the situation and that we would like to return. At the same time; the Flight Attendant called back saying she was seeing smoke coming out from along the aisle; down around where the emergency lights are. I asked her if it smelled like smoke; a burning smell; or an electrical smell. She went to investigate and then call us back.We were still on the SID and I had started to level off back down to 3;000 FT.The Flight Attendant called back and said that there is no smell at all; the smoke is like a mist; and it is cold air coming out. Tower at this time asked us if we would like to land on [Runway] XXR or YYR. We informed the Tower that we were still analyzing the problem; so he sent us to Departure. We contacted Departure and he had us fly heading 185 degrees and climb to 4;000 FT.The Flight Attendant called us to say that the smoke had gone away; but as soon as I added thrust to climb to 4;000 FT the smoke reappeared. I asked if there was any smell again and she said no; and [that] it was still cold air coming out. All this happened in a very short time frame. At this time we realized that it was not smoke; but condensation coming from the air conditioning packs. We had received no indications of anything abnormal in the cockpit; no EICAS messages; and all readings on the systems page of the MFD were normal. The cabin was warm and humid from the taxi out; so the temperature control was set to cold on the Flight Attendant control panel.At this point; Departure asked us what we wanted to do. We talked about that if we returned we would have to perform an overweight landing; around 4;500 LBS overweight. We decided it was safe to continue the flight. Departure gave us a heading to rejoin the SID; which put us on a heading that we could return if need be.The Flight Attendant called us back to say the condensation was gone and had not returned. At no time while talking with Tower or Departure did we declare an emergency; only saying initially to the Tower that we needed to return to the airport. That was before we had all the information about what was happening in the cabin. Only after evaluating the facts did we decide not to return.Concentrating on planning a return overweight landing while running checklists; coordinating with ATC; and communicating with the Flight Attendant can lead to missed steps. I must continue to stay vigilant and not rush through things while also maintaining the safety of the aircraft; passengers; and crew. Also; [while] not dismissing the Flight Attendant's call; [I should] not be distracted by it during the critical phase of takeoff (especially near or at V1) until it is safe to answer. I never want to discourage anyone on the flight crew to inform me if there is a problem or safety issue.,,To prevent this type of situation from occurring again; flight crew should be aware of the difference between smoke and mist from the air conditioning packs.,,An E145 flight crew continued their takeoff when the Flight Attendant called as they approached V1. After airborne the Attendant advised of 'smoke' coming from the floor of the cabin. The smoke eventually was determined to be condensation from the air conditioning system as it cooled the hot humid air. The flight continued to its destination when the condensation was identified and later abated.,"The incident involved an E145 aircraft with an inoperative Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), requiring an external air start. During takeoff, the flight attendant reported ""smoke"" in the cabin, prompting the flight crew to consider returning to the airport. However, after further investigation, the ""smoke"" was identified as condensation from the air conditioning packs, which was exacerbated by the warm and humid cabin air from the taxi. The flight crew ultimately decided to continue the flight after the condensation dissipated and determined there was no immediate threat to safety. The proposed solution emphasizes the importance for flight crew to recognize the difference between smoke and condensation from the air conditioning system.",crew-related issues

She indicated that we needed a wheelchair at our destination. The conversation seemed to be slightly longer than normal and so when the First Officer returned to the radio the Captain inquired if there was something wrong. During relaying this information to the Captain; the flight crew missed the hold short of L3. Air Traffic Control inquired about this and immediately issued a clearance to continue on Mike to hold short of 9L at M2. The Flight Attendant call was a distraction as well as fatigue in this instance.,,,,An air carrier Flight Attendant called the cockpit during taxi for takeoff requesting a passenger wheel chair at the destination; but the distraction plus fatigue caused a taxi deviation.,"An air carrier flight attendant called the cockpit during taxi for takeoff, requesting a wheelchair at the destination. This call, combined with crew fatigue, distracted the flight crew. As a result, the crew missed an ATC instruction to hold short of L3, leading to a minor taxi deviation.

We were all in our jump seats and had been anticipating landing when I noticed that we appeared to be circling. We were still at considerable altitude; higher than normal for that phase of flight. Knowing we were in 'sterile cockpit' I just waited; thinking to myself there must be a lot of traffic this time of night because if there were any problems the Captain would let us know.Just then; the 'all-call' came over the PA. I answered and identified myself. The Captain answered and said; 'We have a problem with our flaps not deploying the usual way so we have to get them down another way that just takes some time. I guess you could call this a simple 'heads up' because I anticipate a completely normal landing and there is nothing to worry about.' I said; 'Okay; thank you;' and then confirmed my crew had heard our exchange.We landed without incident; although CFR was at the ready down the runway. Upon deplaning; some passengers were curious as to why it took so long to land. I stated it was just traffic. I did not feel there was any need to alarm these passengers in any way when all was okay. There was only one passenger who challenged me by stating that he saw the fire equipment and that the flaps were still completely down even at the gate; so it wasn't just traffic.After landing and debriefing with my crew I explained what I thought had occurred and confirmed with the two flight attendants at door 4 that they both had said 'yes' when I asked if they heard the information. Unfortunately; we did not identify which doors had heard the info. I think in an effort to proctor excellent communication with all crew members when a situation that involves all crew members needing to be informed; that a new procedure [be implemented] to acknowledge receipt of the information door by door. That way if the Purser does not hear confirmation from all exits; he/she knows to relay the information to anyone who did not pick up the interphone.Upon turning on my phone on the way to the parking lot I listened to a very concerned message from a Supervisor who knew of the situation and wanted to be certain that the crew was okay. I returned her call and assured her that there was nothing out of the ordinary on landing. The Captain did not advise us to brief the cabin; it was merely a 'heads up' for the Flight Attendants and we landed without incident.,,,,Incomplete dissemination of information regarding a flap extension problem; which delayed the landing of a B757-200; left some passengers concerned; and some Flight Attendants uninformed.,"The incident involved a flap deployment issue on a B757-200 flight, which led to a delayed landing. The captain informed the flight attendants of the problem via the public address system, describing it as a minor issue that would not affect the landing. The flight attendant relayed the information to her crew and ensured they were prepared for landing. However, the delay caused some passengers to notice fire equipment on the ground, leading to questions about the situation. One passenger raised concerns about the flaps not being down, suggesting the delay was not due to traffic. After landing, the flight attendant debriefed her crew and realized that not all crew members may have received the initial communication. To address this, she proposed implementing a new procedure requiring each crew member to acknowledge receipt of information door by door, ensuring everyone is informed in similar situations. The incident concluded safely with no further issues, and the captain and crew confirmed that the landing was uneventful.",crew-related issues

The aircraft was in taxi out mode. The other Flight Attendant noticed that the safety strap at the L2 door was stuck in the door. I tried to pull it back in; but it would not budge. I saw some light coming through from where the strap was. I called the flightdeck; apologized for interrupting; and asked if they were showing any indications of the integrity of the seal being breeched. He said everything looked fine. I told him about the strap. I said that if he could stop the aircraft; I could quickly crack the door and bring the strap back in. He said it wasn't as easy as that because the aircraft was already pressurized. I then asked him what the ramifications could be if we left it alone. He said that it might cause a squealing sound on climb but should eventually go away when we leveled off. So; I said as long as there weren't any warning bells; and he was comfortable with leaving it; then I would leave it alone. I also said that I would contact him if anything happened. As soon as we took off; the door started squealing; and it actually got louder the higher we went. It could be heard full force all the way up to the divider. It was like a horn being blown. I waited until 10;000 to see if it would go away; but it didn't. I called the pilots; and they could hear it over the intercom without me telling them. He suggested putting a wet rag on it. That didn't do anything. No one was complaining about any physical reactions; except the other Flight Attendant was getting a headache. The noise was just so obnoxiously loud that it wasn't right to put the passengers through it. So; the Captain returned to the departure airport. On the ground; a mechanic from one of the smaller airlines; came and checked out the door seal; said it was fine; we took on more gas; and we left. Maybe emphasizing something like 'strap check' in the whole door closure routine.,,Excessively loud squeal from L2 Door caused by safety strap caught in door pressure seal. [I] elected to return to the departure airport to remove safety strap. Flight Attendant called us in the cockpit from the back of the aircraft while we were approaching the runway prior to takeoff to advise us that a safety strap was caught in an aft service/entry door. After a discussion of the situation with the crew and verification by the Flight Attendant visually and by cockpit indication that the doors were closed and locked; my assessment was that there were no associated safety of flight issues and no risk of damage to the aircraft. I discussed my assessment with the crew; considered the alternatives and the comfort level of the crew with the process; and elected to go. As is the case in situations like this; there were factors that biased my assessment that it would be OK to fly with the strap in the door frame. My bias factors were: 1. Previous experience. I had experienced safety straps in the doors of Boeing aircraft on occasion over the years; and had discussed with others their experiences. That basis of experience set my frame of reference to the situation. My mindset was that if there was no metal piece of the strap caught in the door; and nothing extending to the outside of the door; that we could operate with safety and without risk of aircraft damage. 2. Progress of flight and operational considerations. We were operating out of an airport without a Control Tower; with a limitation for one IFR or special VFR aircraft allowed to operate in the airspace at a time. We had our clearance; and had aircraft waiting behind us to receive their clearance after we exited the airspace. We discussed the possibility of having the Flight Attendant pop open the door and pull the strap in; but we were pre-pressurized for takeoff and I was not keen on the safety aspect of having the door popped open without stairs up to the aircraft. So the remaining option was to taxi down the runway and back to the ramp; shut down; bring the stairs; and open the door to clear the strap. That option also would have made it necessary to refuel to bring us back to our required fuel after the taxi burn; which at this particular airport equates to a significant wait time for the fueler to show up. Did I make the right choice? No. That was apparent to me immediately during climbout when the flight attendants called on the Service Interphone and I could hear the squeal in the background. I had heard pressure squeals in the past but nothing close to the loudness of this one. Would I make that choice again? No. What I will do and what I would share with other crews is that it is necessary to clear the strap from the door frame prior to flight. Doesn't matter if it requires a taxi-back; another de-ice; more fuel; ATC clearance issues; or any other operationally undesirable factors which exist.,,A B737's L2 door safety strap was trapped in the door seal after it was closed but the crew decided to depart only to return to the departure airport because of the excessively loud squeal.,"The incident involved a safety strap on the B737's L2 door becoming trapped during closure. The flight attendant noticed the issue and informed the cockpit, but the pilots assessed it as low risk, deciding to proceed with takeoff. During the flight, a loud squealing noise developed, prompting an immediate return to the departure airport. Mechanics confirmed the door's integrity, and the flight resumed after refueling. The flight attendant suggested incorporating a more thorough strap check into pre-flight procedures. The pilot acknowledged bias from past experiences and operational constraints, learning the importance of resolving such issues before takeoff to prevent disruptions.",crew-related issues

I advised Commercial radio and a discrete HF frequency was arranged and the patch was made. An on board ER nurse attended the passenger; made evaluations; provided treatment; and talked directly to Medlink. Medlink advised that we could continue and to provide O2 as needed. The Flight Attendant advised that they were using the Therapeutic O2 bottle. The Flight Attendant later advised us when the therapeutic bottle reached 250 PSI and a decompression bottle was used. As we still had several hours of flying; we discussed O2 use; and operational restrictions regarding depletion of O2 bottles. The First Officer and I discussed that the safest course of action; regardless of O2 quantities; would be to remain at altitude. I advised the First Officer that I was exercising Captains Emergency Authority in the event any of those bottles went below the prescribed volumes in order to remain at altitude. I discussed an O2 use plan with the Flight Attendant. We discussed using one decompression bottle to 1;500 PSI; then switch to the other decompression bottle; and use it until depleted. Shortly afterwards; she advised me that the first decompression bottle was at 1;250 PSI. I told her to switch to decompression bottle two; use it to 1;500 PSI; then use decompression bottle one; and deplete it. My thought was to ensure the Flight Attendant's maintained full capabilities in their mobility bottles. Shortly after this discussion; the  Flight Attendant advised that they could use their mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. With this information we revised our plan to include the mobility bottles as long as they ensured the mobility bottles did not go below 1;000 PSI. ACARS messages were sent to Dispatch advising them of the O2 usage and the volume levels of the bottles. After the second decompression bottle was used to 1;500 PSI; two mobility bottles were depleted to 1;000 PSI and a third was being used as we began our descent. Upon landing we were met by medics and the passenger was transported to medical facilities. Once we were deplaned I discussed O2 bottle usage with the Flight Attendants to ensure I fully understood the amount used. I discovered that the therapeutic bottle was depleted to 250 PSI; the number one decompression bottle to 250 PSI; number two to 1;500 PSI; and two mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. Mechanics boarded the aircraft; were advised and we discussed the write ups of the bottles as well as the EMK. [We were in a] high workload environment in ETOPS airspace. Medlink event happened near a waypoint with need to arrange for Medlink; plot; and report waypoints; monitor Medlink transmissions via HF; and derive an O2 use plan with Flight Attendant's that would be sufficient for a number of hours. There appeared to be confusion between the naming conventions of each type of bottle and the amount we could use before encountering altitude restrictions. I thought that the Flight Attendant was trading the names of the therapeutic bottle and the decompression bottle. Once on the ground I discovered that both the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle were depleted to 250 PSI.,,,,An  Air Carrier flight crew depleted their cabin oxygen bottles below acceptable limits while treating a passenger who became ill near the ETP. There was confusion with naming conventions of the bottles and operational restrictions.,"The incident involved a flight crew and a flight attendant responding to a passenger illness requiring medical attention during a flight in ETOPS airspace. The flight attendant initially requested Medlink assistance, and the crew arranged for a discrete HF frequency to facilitate communication. An onboard emergency room nurse evaluated the passenger, and Medlink advised continuing the flight while providing oxygen as needed. The flight attendant used a therapeutic oxygen bottle, later switching to decompression bottles and mobility bottles as the flight progressed. Despite efforts to manage oxygen levels, confusion arose regarding the naming conventions and operational restrictions of the oxygen bottles. As a result, some bottles were depleted below prescribed limits. Upon landing, the crew reviewed the oxygen usage and discovered discrepancies in the bottle levels, including the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle being depleted to 250 PSI. Mechanics were boarded to address the oxygen bottle write-ups and ensure compliance with safety standards. Post-incident, the crew discussed the oxygen bottle usage to clarify naming conventions and prevent future operational issues.",crew-related issues

I proceeded to get up and disarm the slide and remove the red strap across the window. I then turned on the POS to transmit and unlocked the lavatories. I left the galley and stood by the aft lavatories and watched the deplaning process. A few passengers came back to use the restroom. Deplaning was a slow process.When there were only a few passengers left another Flight Attendant suggested we check to make sure the slides were disarmed. I was not expecting anything to be wrong. She then turned and said that my slide was still armed but my red strap was undone. I was in total disbelief! I could not believe that when I bent down to disarm the slide that I did not. I have never removed the red strap prior to disarming the door. I have always been extremely careful in following procedures. I cannot explain why the slide was not disarmed. I can see myself bending down and disarming the door. There were no emergencies or passengers asking for things or anything to disrupt my routine. However; when I proceeded back to disarm the door the second time; I did notice that the hooks that the slide sits in when disarmed were loose. The bar was more or less just sitting in the hooks rather than needing to be pressed down. So now I wonder if I put the bar in the hooks but did not make certain they were in there securely and they slipped out. My error is that I did not double and triple check the disarmed door to make sure the bar stayed in the hooks and would not fall out. Another factor may have been that I was tired and ready to get off the airplane. What I learned in this situation was to just step back and review all of the procedures each and every time I am disarming/arming a door. Maybe it has become such a habit that I need to make sure I am absolutely aware of what I am doing at all times.,,,,A B737-900 Flight Attendant failed to properly disarm her emergency exit. An alert compatriot noted the error and the omission was promptly corrected.,"The incident occurred during the deplaning process of a B737-900 aircraft when the lead flight attendant failed to properly disarm her emergency exit slide. After completing routine procedures, including disarming the slide and removing the red strap, the lead attendant monitored the deplaning process. However, an alert colleague noticed the slide was still armed, prompting the lead attendant to re-examine her actions. Upon revisiting, she discovered the slide's hooks were loose, causing the bar to slip out. Reflecting on the oversight, the lead attendant attributed the error to not thoroughly securing the bar and possible fatigue. She learned the importance of meticulously reviewing procedures each time, especially ensuring the bar was securely placed. The colleague's timely intervention corrected the error, emphasizing the value of diligence and teamwork in safety protocols.",crew-related issues

She said a passenger found it in the seatback pocket. I had a napkin; held out my hand; turned to the cockpit door which was still open; and told the Captain. It was his decision to reopen the door and hand it off to security. Flight Attendant #3 and I both went to her door to disarm and wait for agents. When the door opened; I stepped to the threshold and handed the item to the security agent and explained the situation. (I was unable to step off the aircraft because of minimum crew issues). He immediately started turning the item over and opening it up. Both of us flight attendants were astonished at this and said as much. A gate agent didn't seem the least bit concerned so I said; I don't believe a proper security check was done on the aircraft for one; and secondly it is not procedure to open/handle any items found on the aircraft that they are to be treated as a potential (non secure) item. The gate agent said that he didn't see what the problem was; it was a Palm Pilot and he made a 'risk assessment' of the item and 'it doesn't look like a bomb'! Again; the #3 and I were horrified that he would even say something to that nature; especially since the passengers seated in rows 9 and 10 were in clear earshot of his comment. The #3 and I both told him to keep it down and what was he thinking saying something like that? I turned and went to the cockpit to relay the information the Captain. Shortly thereafter; the gate agent came into the cockpit with the item; at which time I left. The Captain had a discussion with him; during which time the #3 had been in verbal contact with one of our FAMs seated in row 4 to let them know what was going on. Later on in flight we had a chance to discuss the situation with the team leader of the FAMs that evening. We expressed our concern to both the Captain and the FAM leader about the lack of concern shown and how we felt the situation was handled in a complete opposite way that we as flight attendants have always been trained. The gate agent showed no concern toward the situation and treated #3 and I as if we were complete idiots and overreacting to something that was in his opinion just a Palm Pilot that was clearly left on board by a passenger.,,,,A B757 Flight Attendant was given a Palm Pilot type device which a passenger found in a seatback before departure. The item was given to a gate agent who did not handle the item as a security risk which bothered the flight attendants.,"The incident began when a flight attendant discovered a silver item resembling a Palm Pilot in a seatback pocket. It was handed to another attendant, who proceeded to the cockpit. The captain decided to reopen the door to transfer the item to security. Upon opening the door, the flight attendant handed the item to the security agent, who immediately examined and opened it, surprising the attendants. A gate agent, unimpressed, dismissed the item as a simple Palm Pilot and made a risk assessment, claiming it didn't look like a bomb. This comment distressed the attendants, as nearby passengers could hear the exchange. They expressed their concerns to the gate agent, urging caution and adherence to security protocols. The attendant informed the captain, who spoke with the gate agent. Meanwhile, another attendant kept the FAMs informed. Later, the flight attendants discussed their concerns with the FAM team leader, highlighting the gate agent's lack of concern and the mishandling of the situation, which conflicted with their training. They felt the agent's dismissal was inappropriate and questioned his judgment.",crew-related issues

This was a completely full flight; with 2 jumpseat riders in the cabin and 1 in the cockpit.  Shortly after takeoff; the aircraft leveled off.  I noticed that it seemed too early to level off and thought we would continue the climb out momentarily.  Instead; the aircraft started to turn.  I was still in my jumpseat; as we were under 10;000 FT. Neither I nor the jumpseat rider next to me ever heard; felt; or smelled anything different with the aircraft.  After a few minutes; the Captain made a PA to the passengers that we blew a tire on takeoff and we would have to circle to burn off fuel so we could return and land.  After his PA to the passengers; the Captain called back to the Flight Attendants to tell us we blew a tire; we had 30 minutes before landing; do not go through the emergency procedure checklist; and he did not anticipate evacuating but if we did the signal would be our standard.  While the aircraft was circling; we flight attendants did frequent walk throughs to make sure everyone had all bags stowed; electronic devices off; seatbelts fastened; and tray tables and seatbacks up.  Otherwise; we stayed strapped into our jumpseats.  30 minutes came and went with no other communication from the cockpit at all.  I call the cockpit to ask when we were going to land.  I was told it would be about 15 more minutes.  When I sit on the #1 Flight Attendant jumpseat; I cannot see out the windows.  I started to get worried because the Captain was so uncommunicative; I was afraid we would touch down and crash without even knowing we were about to land!  I called the Captain and told him to let us know when we were about to touch down so we could be prepared.  Right before we touched down; he called us and told us we were about to land and it was going to be rough.  I am not sure the exact verbiage; but the #4 Flight Attendant asked if we had one or two tires on the nosegear and the Captain made a flippant; curt reply to this valid question.  The landing was smooth and we taxied to the gate.  When I opened the aircraft door; a woman from Flight Service and a mechanic were waiting for us.  I was the only crew member Flight Service spoke with.  She asked if we were OK.  During this time; two fire fighters with silver suits came up the jetbridge stairs; stood on the jetbridge for a few moments and left.  I kept asking if we blew a tire; as nobody explained to the flight attendants what had actually happened.  The Captain did not let us know on landing if the aircraft was OK or broken.  After many repeated questions upon arrival at the gate; I was told that nobody knew what was wrong with the plane because we had all our tires.  The cabin crew and passengers were informed that we would be changing aircraft and to go to the new gate.  This emergency was handled by the cockpit very poorly.  Company procedures were not followed.  The passengers were informed of the problem before the flight attendants were told; which is NOT procedure.  I had to initiate contact with the Captain.  He did not keep the flight attendants updated on the situation.  We had plenty of time to have gone through the emergency checklist; since we had to circle for so long.  If the Captain suspected it was going to be a rough landing; why did he say NOT to do the emergency checklist?  If the landing was going to be rough; I believe it is procedure for the Captain to say 'Brace'.  We never heard the 'Brace' command.  I was sitting on my jumpseat; waiting to land on the nose and go skidding across the runway with flames shooting out where the nosegear is supposed to be.  The flight attendants were not kept adequately and timely informed of the situation.,,,,MD80 flight attendant was notified by the cockpit crew they were going to return after blowing a nose tire.  The Flight Attendant feels this situation was not handled appropriately by the cockpit crew; creating a confused situation for the uninformed cabin crew.,"The incident involved a flight crew and cabin crew on an MD80 aircraft following a reported tire blowout shortly after takeoff. The flight attendant reported that the Captain informed passengers and the cabin crew about the incident but failed to maintain proper communication with the flight attendants throughout the event. The flight attendant expressed concerns about the lack of updates from the cockpit, which left the cabin crew and passengers in a state of uncertainty. The situation was further complicated by the Captain's refusal to follow standard emergency procedures, such as issuing a ""Brace"" command or allowing the cabin crew to execute the emergency checklist, despite having sufficient time to do so. The flight attendant also noted that the Captain did not provide adequate information upon landing, leaving the cabin crew uninformed about the aircraft's condition. The incident resulted in confusion and frustration among the cabin crew, who felt the cockpit crew mishandled the situation and did not adhere to company protocols. A proposed solution would involve improving communication between the cockpit and cabin crew during emergencies and ensuring adherence to established procedures to better manage such incidents.",crew-related issues

MEL states that seat must be secured retracted with 'tape of a contrasting color' and that the nearest passenger seat must be reserved for the Flight Attendant; and placarded 'For Flight Attendant Use Only'. Commuter flight was 4 hours late; and I was 1.5 hours late for sign in. Aircraft was loaded and the crew and passengers were ready to go when I boarded. [I] gave a brief to the Purser; who was someone familiar to me; and asked if they had taken note of the placarded seat. She said they had; so we departed after completing all checklists. Logbook was properly filled out and placarded for the jumpseat; but I did not physically check the seat. Two hours into the flight we got a call that the 4R jumpseat would not retract. I asked if it had been secured retracted and was told it was not. Entered in logbook that seat was not secured in accordance with MEL. Later; [I] received another call that there was some misunderstanding. There had been an issue with a passenger seat during boarding; and the Purser thought this was what I had referenced in my brief. Since I wasn't there during boarding; I was unaware of this issue and it wasn't in the logbook; and none of the Flight Attendants were aware of the placarded Flight Attendant jumpseat. Apparently; the jumpseat had been secured with tape of the same color as the seat; and the tape had come loose so the seat was available for use; but it still did not retract properly. The appropriate passenger seat had been placarded for Flight Attendant use; but the Flight Attendant MANAGER; prior to boarding; had apparently assumed it was an unauthorized action by the Flight Attendants to obtain a crew rest seat; and removed the tape and placard. Hence; we departed using a placarded and malfunctioning Flight Attendant jumpseat. Once all this became known; the Flight Attendants secured the jumpseat as best they could and used the appropriate passenger seat for landing.,,,,Air Carrier Captain reports confusion among the cabin crew over a malfunctioning jumpseat that has been MEL'ed but not properly identified to the crew.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and the Flight Crew regarding a malfunctioning jumpseat on a commuter flight. The Flight Attendant identified a Maintenance Evaluation Log (MEL) issue with the 4R aft door Flight Attendant jumpseat, which was not retracting properly. According to the MEL, the seat needed to be secured, placarded, and the nearest passenger seat reserved for the Flight Attendant. Despite these requirements, the jumpseat was secured with tape of the same color as the seat, making it less visible, and the placard was removed by the Flight Attendant Manager, who believed it was unauthorized. This led to confusion among the cabin crew, as they were unaware of the issue and the proper procedures. Two hours into the flight, the jumpseat malfunctioned, prompting the crew to secure it and use an appropriate passenger seat for landing.

All takeoff bug speeds were verified in accordance with normal procedures. I was Captain and pilot flying. During takeoff roll; V1 auto-callout was announced by the aircraft 20 knots early. I eased back on the yoke and began rotation; when I realized I was below rotation speed. There was no pilot monitoring callout for rotation. I eased the nose of the aircraft back to the runway. I then rotated at the normal rotation speed and achieved approximately 10 degrees nose up at about 155-160 KTS. Everything else seemed normal. At 10;000 FT; after the sterile chime; a Flight Attendant asked me about the attempted rotation and set down. Her verbiage was approximately; 'What was that bump?' I explained what had happened and inquired if she heard any scraping. She said no. We pressurized normally and continued to our destination. At 3 hours into the flight (approximately); the flight attendants expressed concern that we had scraped the aircraft on takeoff; but were not sure. Upon receiving this new information; the copilot and I conducted the suspected tail-strike on takeoff portion of the QRH. We landed without declaring an emergency at our scheduled destination. After landing; and upon a post flight inspection; damage to the tail-skid was discovered. Dispatch and Chief Pilot were contacted.,,During preflight; I followed all normal procedures. The takeoff data V speeds did not automatically upload to the FMC. I manually inputted the correct V speed from the paperwork into the FMC. I verified they matched prior to pushback. There was no runway change from what I expected prior to pushback to what we received for our takeoff runway. During our takeoff roll; V1 was called early by the auto-voice. I think it was early by about 20 KTS. The Captain started a slow rotation. I knew it was too early; but was unsure of what procedure to advise him to stop rotation. I didn't want to say STOP or ROTATE for fear of confusion. He also recognized the problem shortly after I did and lowered the nose to the ground. Our takeoff then proceeded normally. After 10;000 FT; the Captain spoke with the Flight Attendant and she did not think there was a tail scraping during our takeoff. After about 3 hours more; the Flight Attendants decided we might have scraped some metal on takeoff. We did the QRH procedure for tail strike on takeoff and landed at our destination uneventfully. Because we suspected damage; we conducted a thorough exterior inspection and found some damage on the tail skid plate.,,A B737-800 Captain rotated 20 KTS below V1 when the autovoice V1 erroneously made the callout and then set down for a short period before rotating again. During the second rotation a tail strike occurred which flight attendants reported but the pilots did not immediately react to the report.,"The incident was triggered by an early V1 call from the auto-voice system during takeoff, prompting the Captain to rotate the aircraft prematurely. During takeoff, the Captain began rotating 20 knots below the required V1 speed due to the early call. Recognizing the issue, the Captain set the aircraft back down, then rotated again at the correct speed. Post-takeoff, a Flight Attendant inquired about a perceived bump, but the pilots initially ruled out any scraping. Three hours into the flight, the Flight Attendants expressed concern about potential damage, leading the pilots to consult the QRH for a tail strike. The aircraft landed safely, and a post-flight inspection revealed tail-skid damage. The aircraft sustained tail-skid damage but landed without emergency declaration. The incident highlighted the need for procedures to address early V1 calls and enhance crew communication during takeoffs. The investigation likely led to updated protocols for handling early V1 callouts and improving crew coordination to prevent similar incidents.",crew-related issues

It is very faint in flight.  I turned around and was prepared to keep the cockpit secure.  I saw that it was our First Flight Attendant.  He said that they had been trying to call us but the bells in the cockpit were not working.  We looked around and found that the handset at the back of the center console was slightly out of its cradle.  I was not aware that that silences all the call chimes in the cockpit.  We then had the flight attendants call us with the cockpit handset secured and off the hook and determined that it indeed does cut out the cockpit chimes when off the hook.  We flew on and landed as planned.  The flight was normal.  The man on the phone that asked for the report said there was some issue with my headset.  I don't know what that is about.  I was wearing the same headset that I have used for the last seven years; including all the check rides and flights with chief pilots and check airmen.  I have a noise canceling aviation headset.  It works great.  It protects my hearing and makes the HF radio clear and understandable.  It was plugged into the headset plugs in the airplane and I was monitoring 123.45 and 121.5.,The reporter states that the continuous chime announcing that the door unlock code had been entered was audible but not something that he had heard before and was therefore somewhat surprised when the cockpit door opened.,While in cruise; approximately 3 hours into flight; A Flight Attendant tried to check on our welfare; but we did not hear the inter phone chimes because the inter phone was not in its cradle properly or reset. Since there was no response from us; the Flight Attendant used the flight deck door code to enter the flight deck. I did not hear the door alarm. The cause of not hearing the flight deck inter phone chime was the improper cradling or reset of the hand set. Both myself and the First Officer were wearing head sets with both ears covered and I was listening to the HF radio and the common frequency for reports of turbulence; which I believe prevented us from hearing the door alarm.,,B757-200 flight crew is surprised to see the a Flight Attendant entering the cockpit to check on their welfare during a night flight over the Pacific.  The call bells were muted due to the handset not being in its' cradle and both pilots were wearing noise canceling headsets masking the door chimes.,"During a B757-200 flight over the Pacific, the flight crew was cruising at night when an incident occurred. The cause was identified as the cockpit handset being out of its cradle, which muted the call chimes. Additionally, the pilots were wearing noise-cancelling headsets, which prevented them from hearing the door alarm. The flight attendant attempted to contact the cockpit via interphone but received no response. As a result, the attendant used the door code to enter the cockpit. The pilots did not hear the door alarm, partly due to the headsets and their focus on monitoring the HF radio and common frequency. The incident was resolved when the crew secured the cockpit handset, restoring normal operations. The flight landed as planned without further issues. The proposed solution was to ensure the handset is properly secured to prevent similar occurrences.",crew-related issues

We were level at 11;000 FT heading about 210 when both First Officer and I heard our callsign and instructions to descend to 6;000 FT and head 190. We were instructed to contact Approach on 119.4 and told of traffic at 1 o'clock and 10;000 FT. I stated to the First Officer 'I wonder why they would give us that clearance with traffic over there.' I had barely started down when the First Officer told me to level as she was looking at the TCAS and I was searching outside. I actually climbed the aircraft before getting the RA. People were deviating from LIT all the way in and also in the terminal area. The ATC Manager said those instructions were for another flight and that the Controller had issued them twice. We evidentially responded on the second call but we were blocked by the other flight responding. This was the second 84 plus hour month in a row for me having just completed a 4 day trip and flying 25.30 hours on that trip. I was assigned this trip in the evening and confirmed the deadhead out with crew scheduling. I had to sit in the jumpseat out because the dead head was made on an oversold flight and could not check in early for a seat. The agent said it was either the jumpseat or not at all. Crew tracking could not be reached (did not answer my call to resolve issue) I took the jumpseat and headed out. It was either that or not get there in time for the flight I was working out. Fatigue does cause one to lose that edge especially needed in the terminal area. I even question myself now as to why I would have even begun such a descent. If my game was on it would not have happened. With 4 days of early get ups it is not surprising that this could have happened. With manning the way it is I expect more of these types of deviations to affect the pilots at our company. Just look at how much flying reserve pilots did at my base and you'll get my point. I guess some would say that was perfect utilization of the reserves. Pilots on reserve know better. We are pretty much beat.,,We were deviating around build ups at 11;000 and unable to cross STONZ on BYP arrival. We had been coordinating with ATC. I (pilot not flying) stated that we were unable to cross STONZ. What I heard after that was fly heading 190 descend to 6;000 contact Approach which seemed very reasonable considering we were deviating and need to rejoin the arrival. I read that back and then the Controller said that we had traffic 1 o'clock at 10;000. I responded that we were looking and switched frequencies. I think I called twice. During this time I was looking at the TCAS screen and the pilot flying had started down. I saw the conflict and told him to level. He clicked off the autopilot and was beginning a climb when we got the RA. I checked in again and stated we were responding to an RA. After the Captain spoke with ATC Manager and we learned the clearance had not been ours. We had no idea the conflict was our fault until the tape was pulled. I have no idea how we mistook a 4 digit call sign for a 3 digit call sign.  I will be extremely cautious in the future. I just wanted to add that once we leveled and began to climb I did have the aircraft in sight. This was not an abrupt maneuver by any means.,,Air Carrier flight crew reports accepting a clearance to descend intended for another aircraft which results in a TCAS RA. Fatigue was cited as a factor.,"The incident occurred when a flight crew mistakenly accepted a descent clearance intended for another aircraft, resulting in a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA). The pilot, experiencing fatigue due to long working hours and a deadhead flight, descended after receiving the instruction. The First Officer noticed a conflict on the TCAS and instructed the pilot to level, but the pilot initially climbed, prompting the RA. The crew later learned the clearance was for another flight, issued twice by ATC. Fatigue was identified as a contributing factor, with the pilot noting the impact of extended hours on performance. The incident highlights the need for improved crew scheduling and management to mitigate fatigue-related risks.",crew-related issues

After I determined what the problem was I went to the jet bridge to call Maintenance Control. At the same time there was a Flight Attendant using the other phone on the jet bridge. As I was talking the Flight Attendant paused her conversation to ask me if it was OK to board the aircraft. I replied; 'No; it is not OK to board; please hold boarding'. She then advised the gate agent 'the mechanic said no; it is not OK to board'.After I finished my conversation with Maintenance Control; I went back to the cockpit to inform the Captain. I also informed the flight crew and the flight attendants that I had to go down in the E&E compartment to do a 'BITE' test on the IRU; and for them to not let any one near this area. At that point I proceed to go to the E&E compartment through the floor entrance.Shortly after I entered the E&E compartment I heard a noise. I looked to my right and discovered that someone had fallen into the E&E compartment. I asked the passenger if he was OK and he confirmed that he was. At that point I called out for help. After what seemed to be a minute or two the passenger stood up. I asked him again if he was OK and he said 'yes; I am OK'. At that point I watched him as he climbed out of the E&E compartment.,,The Captain attempted to help the individual who became belligerent and non-compliant to instructions from both him and the Purser.,,A Mechanic who needed to access the E&E compartment of a B767-300ER asked that boarding be delayed until he finished his maintenance procedure.

I could see the Ramp Agent pushing the stairs to the aft door; so I made the announcement that we would be deplaning out both the forward and aft exits. Although the door chime had not been given; the Ramp Agent opened the aft door and gave me a thumbs up to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots never told us to hold passengers and I could see that the 'A' Flight Attendant had opened the main cabin door; so I let passengers start to deplane. I did not realize an engine was still running due to problems with the APU. I was having trouble getting my ears to pop and could not hear very well. The ramp agents never told me to keep passengers on board. Even after the passengers started getting off; the ramp agents continued to unload bags. I didn't fully realize what had happened until we were in the taxi on our way to the hotel and Flight Attendant 'A' brought it up. We all should have communicated better and the aft door should not have been opened by the ramp until the engines were shut down and it was safe for passengers to deplane.We need to stress the importance of the ramp [personnel] being aware of what is going on around them. The ramp [personnel] are the eyes and ears for flight attendants as we can't always see or hear what is happening outside the aircraft. Also making sure the cabin crew is more observant; not always counting on the ramp [personnel] to give them accurate info.,,Opened main cabin door and found #2 engine still running in cool down mode.

Flight crew had shut down #1 [engine] and was waiting for ground crew to properly connect GPU; so they left #2 [engine] running in cool down mode much longer than normal. Flight crew shut down #2 [engine] upon learning main cabin door was open.,,Unaware that the right engine was still running; awaiting ground power; the Gate Agent and Flight Attendant at the aft main door of a Q400 opened the door and deplaned passengers.,"An incident occurred at a Q400 aircraft when passengers began deplaning through the aft door without the right engine being shut down, due to insufficient communication and awareness among the flight crew, ground personnel, and cabin crew. Upon arrival, the seatbelt signs were off, but the door chime was not received. The Ramp Agent opened the aft door, prompting the Flight Attendant to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots had shut down engine #1 but left engine #2 running, awaiting ground power unit connection. The flight attendant, unaware of the running engine, permitted deplaning. Another flight attendant noticed the engine still running and shut it down after passengers had started leaving. Passengers deplaned while engine #2 was running, posing a safety risk. Post-incident, all parties agreed on the need for enhanced communication and awareness. Improve communication and coordination among flight, ground, and cabin crew. Ground personnel should act as the eyes and ears for the flight crew. Cabin crew should enhance their observational skills and not solely rely on ground crew information. This incident highlights the importance of clear communication and situational awareness to prevent similar occurrences.",crew-related issues

During cruise flight; First Officer called Lead Flight Attendant (FA#1) to request a trip to the Lavatory. A few minutes later; Lead Flight Attendant called flight deck to advise that it was set up.  The First Officer got up; verified that the area outside of the flight deck door was clear and that the isle was barricaded; then opened the flight deck door.  As I was adjusting the oxygen mask and setting up the comm panel; the Lead Flight Attendant asked if 'so-and-so' could enter the flight deck (instead of the Lead Flight Attendant entering the flight deck) while the First Officer was gone.  In our crew; we had a new Flight Attendant (FA#2); who I had not previously worked with.  When the Lead Flight Attendant asked if 'so-and-so' could enter the flight deck; I assumed that he was asking about the new Flight Attendant as I could not recall her name.  I answered that she may. As I was testing the interphone function of the oxygen mask; I heard the flight deck door close and looked up and was shocked to see an employee of my airline standing on the flight deck with the door closed!  This individual is employed by my airline as a Customer Service Representative (CSR) in my base.  She was wearing her airline uniform and had her ID displayed on an armband.  I was stunned and somewhat shaken to see her and not a Flight Attendant.  I considered having her exit the flight deck immediately; but choose to minimize the flight deck door opening and closing by waiting for the First Officer to return.  Total time with this individual on the flight deck was approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  During this time; she stood in the aft part of the flight deck; adjacent to the flight deck door.  When the First Officer called the flight deck for entry; I had the CSR visually identify the First Officer through the peep hole.  I unlocked the flight deck door and the CSR exited and the First Officer returned and the flight deck door was secured. At no time did I intend to permit access to the flight deck an individual who was not authorized.  It was my understanding that the Lead Flight Attendant had asked if it would be allowable for Flight Attendant #2 to enter the flight deck instead of the Lead Flight Attendant as prescribed.  It was my intent to allow FA#2 to enter the flight deck as this was her second trip and I feel that it is important that the flight attendants are exposed the flight deck environment in the event of an emergency requiring Flight Attendant assistance on the flight deck. After this episode; I asked the Lead Flight Attendant why he would even ask if I would allow access to the flight deck of individual who was not authorized.  He stated that he didn't know that a CSR was not authorized to enter the flight deck.  I suggested that he review his Flight Attendant Manual and informed him that a security breech regarding access to the flight deck is a very serious matter.  He assured me that it would not happen again. This report is submitted to remind all flight crew members that flight deck access procedures are in place to protect the security of the flight crew members and the safety of the aircraft and passengers.,,,,A Captain reported that his Lead Flight Attendant allowed a Customer Service Representative to enter the cockpit while the First Officer went to the lavatory; instead of a Flight Attendant.

FA#1 intended to send Flight Attendant #2 (FA#2), but a Customer Service Representative (CSR) entered instead. The Captain, unaware of the CSR's identity, permitted access, leading to the unauthorized individual being on the flight deck for approximately 3-4 minutes. Upon realizing the error, the Captain addressed FA#1, highlighting the seriousness of the security breach. The outcome emphasized the need to strictly adhere to flight deck access protocols to ensure safety and security. The proposed solution was a reminder to review procedures and ensure only authorized personnel are granted access.",crew-related issues

Why? Our inbound flight was delayed more than 2 hours so the turn time was very quick. The Agent was very hurried to get the plane cleaned and get it out ASAP. I was greeting passengers. When they were all boarded; the number three Flight Attendant came to the front to say [that the] exits were briefed. At that point we were all near the front door.The Agent closed the door and pulled the jetway and the Purser said to arm doors. Number three and I then walked to the back of the plane; planning to arm the doors. As I left the front of the plane I realized I had a personal problem. I walked back to get something out of my bag and told my partner I needed to take care of something and went to the lavatory. She; at that time; was also getting something out of the other lavatory for a passenger. When I came out she was in the jumpseat; so I put my bag away and sat down; forgetting to arm my door.Shortly after takeoff; I noticed her door wasn't armed; then looked at mine and realized both doors did not get armed. We then both armed our doors.We later tried to go over the reasons why this happened. I believe the number one reason was trying to rush our departure combined with distractions that happened right as we needed to arm our doors.,,,,Caught up in a maelstrom of activity and the need to address a personal problem as their departure was rushed due to a late arrival; two flight attendants aboard an A320 realized only after takeoff that neither had armed their door for departure.,"The incident occurred when two flight attendants on an A320 failed to arm their respective doors before takeoff.

The safety video had not ended and we had not gone out to do our cabin safety checks. I called the Purser and told him to call the cockpit and tell them that we had not done our cabin safety checks. I went out into the aisle to do my checks. As I worked my way back there was a man with a large briefcase on his lap. I repeatedly told him to stow his briefcase. Just then I hear the engines rev and we started to roll down the runway. I was still standing in the aisle. I ran back to my jumpseat and barely got to sit down and put my seatbelt and shoulder harness on before we lifted off. I waited till 18;000 FT and then called the Purser. I asked him 'Did you call the cockpit and tell them that we were in the aisle doing our cabin safety checks'. He said 'Yes and they said we got to go; we got to go'. I then waited until the seatbelt sign went off and the cockpit finished their announcement to the passengers and called them. The First Officer answered. I asked him: Did the Purser call you and tell you that we were in the aisle doing our cabin safety checks because I was still in the aisle when you took off'. He said to me 'The Purser said give me two seconds. We were on the runway and if we would have pulled off then we would have had to wait 30 minutes'. I again told him 'Well I was still in the aisle when you guys took off. Thank you I just needed to check what had happened.',,,,An A320 crew took off with a flight attendant in the aisle performing the cabin safety check.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the flight crew of an A320 aircraft.

Despite the safety video not being completed and the cabin safety checks not being fully executed, the cockpit proceeded with takeoff. The flight attendant was still in the aisle when the aircraft began rolling down the runway and had to rush to her jumpseat to secure herself before takeoff. After reaching 18,000 feet, she informed the purser, who had communicated with the cockpit. The first officer explained that the cockpit had decided to proceed with takeoff to avoid a 30-minute delay.

[We] arrived in ZZZ2 at 2111 with a 02 hour and 35 minute ground time before continuing to operate the 'red-eye' from ZZZ2 to ZZZ3.  I afforded all opportunity to get plenty of rest to prepare for the trip.  I stayed overnight at a nearby hotel; checked out at 1730 and proceeded to the airport for a 1900 check-in.  I completed at least 12 hours of total sleep prior to reporting for the trip.  Upon arrival at ZZZ2 from ZZZ1; I felt pretty good during the 2 hour and 35 minute ground time.  We left ZZZ2 for ZZZ3 at 2345 and both my First Officer and I felt alert.  About half way to ZZZ3; both my First Officer and I experienced the onset of fatigue.Symptoms included yawning; short naps; head nod; and reduced concentration.  We missed several radio calls from ATC.  I attempted to combat fatigue by placing the overhead cockpit lights to bright; but this reduced our outside visibility; then I selected DIM on the lights.  This helped initially; but we both continued to suffer from the effects of fatigue.  I had the flight attendant call us every 15 minutes to ensure we were alert.  Once we started our descent and approach into ZZZ3; our alertness increased.  This is due to the increased task of preparing for the arrival.  Total duty period was 11 hours and 8 minutes.I suggest the company not schedule more than one flight activity when spanning the hours of 0200-0500.  When a red-eye is scheduled as the only activity; I do much better since I can rest all the way up to report time.  Having to complete flying activity prior to the red-eye; coupled with a sit time in ZZZ2; is a recipe for disaster.  Even after I had afforded all opportunity to rest prior to the event; I experienced fatigue during cruise.  Had the effects degraded further than experienced; I would have had no choice but to divert to a location well short of our destination to get proper rest before continuing.,,,,An air carrier Captain related the debilitating effects of fatigue resulting from back side of the clock scheduling including extended breaks between flight segments.,"The incident involved a flight crew experiencing fatigue due to backside-of-the-clock scheduling, which led to reduced alertness and performance during a red-eye flight. The captain and first officer reported symptoms of fatigue, including yawning, short naps, and reduced concentration, which began approximately halfway through the flight. These symptoms caused them to miss several radio calls from air traffic control (ATC). The crew attempted to mitigate fatigue by adjusting cockpit lighting and having the flight attendant check on their alertness every 15 minutes. Alertness improved as the flight approached its destination due to increased pre-arrival tasks. The captain recommended that the company avoid scheduling multiple flight activities between 0200-0500 and instead allow rest periods before red-eye flights to prevent fatigue-related risks.",crew-related issues

We conducted FL180 and below checklist with exception of altimeter setting. I informed Captain I would be off frequency to get arrival ATIS. He handled all communication during this time while hand flying the aircraft (autopilot not used). Very long ATIS due to air show requirements. I returned to frequency and as I looked up; I saw the altitude selector at 11;000 FT (per clearance) but aircraft was leveling 10;000 FT. Center at that point asked our altitude. I heard the Captain say; 'my bad I missed it.' I responded to Center; 'returning to 11;000 FT.' Captain returned to 11;000 FT and flight continued to our destinataion without further incident; but extremely busy due to high volume radio and aircraft traffic. I fly as a contract pilot with this company and am quite familiar with aircraft FMS/EFIS; and NAV systems but note the Captain tends to hand fly the aircraft in the highest traffic; highest work load times. Numerous times I have had to call out 'altitude' when he was flying and going off assigned altitude. I have pointed this out but Captain said nothing and evidently won't change his procedure. I will fly with him in the future but will encourage autopilot use and monitor his climb and descent profiles closely.,,,,A First Officer reported leaving ATC frequency to get the ATIS and upon his return discovered the hand flying Captain leveling at 10;000 FT with Altitude Alerter at 11;000 FT.

Upon returning, the first officer noticed the captain had leveled off at 10,000 feet despite the altitude selector being set to 11,000 feet. ATC contacted the flight, prompting the captain to correct the altitude and resume the flight without further issues. The high workload and manual flying by the captain were identified as contributing factors.

Flight attendants were not aware that the Captain was armed (due to lack of briefing by the Captain and lack of CLR). The FAMs did not know the Captain was armed (due to lack of CLR and proper briefing with Captain) and in turn the Captain was unaware of the presence of FAMs on the flight. In addition I as Purser was completely distracted from my boarding and Pre-Departure duties. I was not able to provide any safety and security vigilance that is expected of me during the boarding process. This was all due to the fact that our Captain became upset over me serving him his coffee with cream on the side instead of inside the coffee. As the result of this a confrontation ensued between myself and the Captain that lasted throughout the boarding process. The action taken by the Captain and the inflight supervisor was to remove me from the Purser position. My flying partner took over being Purser to appease the Captain. However that did not change the fact that the working crew (both flight attendants and cockpit) was unaware of the armed FAMs onboard and as well as the FAMs were unaware that the Captain was armed.,,,,An air carrier Flight Attendant reported flight attendants and pilots were both unaware that FAMs were on board; and the flight attendants and FAMs were unaware the Captain was an FFDO.  Problem reportedly stemmed from lack of communication resulting from friction between the purser and the Captain before departure.,"The incident occurred due to a lack of communication and briefing between the flight crew, specifically the purser, and the captain. The purser was unaware of the presence of armed Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) on board and the fact that the captain was an FFDO (Federal Flight Deck Officer). Similarly, the FAMs were also unaware of the captain's status. The issue originated from a disagreement between the purser and the captain regarding the serving of coffee, which distracted the purser from their duties and led to a confrontation during the boarding process. As a result, the captain and in-flight supervisor removed the purser from their position, and the purser's partner took over. However, the lack of communication and briefing between the flight crew, cockpit, and FAMs remained unresolved, creating a security risk during the flight.

Approx 5 min later First Officer received a call from the cabin that the passenger passed out in the Flight Attendant's arms and that they were searching for medical professional on board.  Before the First Officer was able to get any additional information the Flight Attendant that called hung up.  The First Officer briefed me on the current situation. I instructed him to prepare for a possible diversion.  I got the ops freq for him and we set the FMS for the diversion. I then took over ATC comm and instructed the First Officer to get more information from the Flight Attendants on the age/sex of passenger name or seat assignment etc in case we needed to make a medical phone patch call. While he was talking to the Flight Attendant I informed ATC of our situation and the possibility of diverting for an unknown medical situation with a passenger that has passed out in the cabin.  The First Officer got in touch with one of the Flight Attendant and received some basic information that the passenger was female; non English speaking; vomiting and abdominal pains with two RN's evaluating her. The Flight Attendant then hung up on the First Officer again.  The First Officer briefed me on the information he received and informed me that in his opinion that both Flight Attendants were in a panic. The First Officer and I discussed the situation and I instructed him that we were 45 min from landing in ZZZ2 or 10 min from ZZZ.  We both agreed we needed more info from the Flight Attendants and RN before beginning our diversion.  I received instruction from ATC to descend to FL320 and switch to another ATC controller.  I checked in with that ATC controller and advised him of the situation of a possible diversion to ZZZ after we received additional information from the cabin on the condition of the passenger. During my conversation with ATC I heard the First Officer inform the Flight Attendant that she needed to ask the RNs for more information on the condition of the passenger; needed a seat assignment at least; and to tell the RN's that we needed a decision whether to continue to ZZZ2 that will take 40 min or divert to ZZZ that will take 10 min. When the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant I informed him of our decent to FL 320 and switched to another center freq.  We again discussed the situation with the Flight Attendant and finished preparations for diversion to ZZZ.  First Officer got ATIS and we set up for landing on RWY 23 in ZZZ.  First Officer then received a call from the Flight Attendant with seat assignment of passenger and that the RN's agreed that it would be best to divert to ZZZ.  When I heard that on the Interphone I informed ATC of or need to divert to ZZZ for a medical emergency. ATC gave  us a left descending turn to direct ZZZ. I informed ATC that we wanted paramedics; ambulance to meet the Aircraft for a female passenger in her mid 30's with abdominal pains and vomiting. After the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant. I brief him of our ATC instructions; asked him to call the company and instruct them that we will be diverting to ZZZ for a medical emergency and to pass on the information to our dispatcher and that we will call him on the ground in ZZZ.  We then completed all checklist and when we contacted ZZZ Approach Control were given straight in to Rwy XX.  We landed 10 min after beginning our descent on Rwy XX and in the Gate; 2 min after landing.  Paramedics took the passenger off the plane and she was transported to a local hospital.  The First Officer suggested that he talk to the Flight Attendant's on the situation to evaluate whether we should continue the flight to ZZZ2 with them.  I agreed.  (First Officer is a certified paramedic) I contacted dispatch and gave him all the information I had and while I was on the phone with him I was handed thepassenger boarding stub with the passenger's name and passed it onto dispatch.  After I finished my call with Dispatch a Flight Attendant came up to the cockpit. I asked her if there was anything used as far as emergency equip the passenger. She informed me that just the stethoscope and blood pressure cuff out of the EEMK [Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit] were used and replaced into the kit.  The First Officer returned to the cockpit and informed me that he talked to both the Flight Attendants and they were more relaxed and he felt that they were capable to continue the flight to ZZZ2 and back to ZZZ.  A few min later Flight Attendant 1 brought up one of the Flight Attendant O2 bottles and informed me that they had to give the passenger O2 and that the bottle pressure was below 1500 psi. I was a little disgusted and informed her that it needed to be replaced or serviced before we can leave ZZZ. I told her that I needed to know all the equipment that was used for this passenger; and should have be told of this when I asked the first time. (Note at this time the paramedics had already removed the passenger and we had been on the ground for about 15 min.) I called Maintenance Control about the O2 bottle and later discussed swapping the O2 bottle with the other CRJ9 that was overnighting.  Contract Maintenance did show up at the aircraft and serviced the O2 bottle. After contract Maintenance had finished the servicing of the O2 bottle and took the maintenance logbook to sign off the writeup the first officer and I prepared the aircraft for departure.  The next two flights were uneventful.  After returning back to ZZZ for the overnight I was performing my shutdown checklist when the Flight Attendant presented me the inventory checklist for the EEMK [Emergency Medical Kit] and First Aid Kit.  I again was disgusted.  The EEMK showed that the all items were in the EEMK but she had checked that it was incomplete and serviceable. One of the First Aid Kits was used and the latex gloves were used and the kit was incomplete. I informed her that this inventory should have been completed before we left ZZZ for ZZZ2 and I should have been informed when I asked her if any emergency equipment was used of the O2 bottle and the latex gloves were used.  I then called Maintenance Control to defer the First Aid Kit and after discussing the EEMK with him he decided to defer both the EEMK and the First Aid Kit that were used.  I left the Aircraft at XA:30 local time.,,,,A CRJ diverted to a nearby airport in response to a passenger medical emergency.  The Captain expressed some concern about the professionalism of the Cabin Attendants' familiarity with the administrative aspects of the aircraft emergency equipment.,"The incident involved a CRJ aircraft diverting to a nearby airport due to a female passenger experiencing a medical emergency, including vomiting and abdominal pains. The flight crew received initial reports from the cabin about the passenger's condition, followed by a request for medical assistance. The cabin crew's communication was described as panicked, with incomplete information provided during initial contacts. The flight crew prepared for the diversion, informed air traffic control (ATC), and requested emergency services at the diversion airport. The aircraft landed at ZZZ, where paramedics transported the passenger to a hospital. Following the landing, the flight crew discovered that emergency oxygen equipment had been used and was not properly serviced. The Captain expressed concern over the cabin crew's handling of the situation and their communication regarding the use of emergency equipment. Maintenance was called to service the oxygen bottle and defer the First Aid Kit, which had been used during the incident. The flight crew also reviewed the inventory of the Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit (EEMK) and found discrepancies in its contents. The flight resumed to its final destination, with no further issues reported during the remainder of the journey. The incident highlighted concerns about the cabin crew's familiarity with administrative procedures related to emergency equipment usage and their communication during critical situations.",crew-related issues

The biohazard guys came on and found that a young boy had a temperature of 38.7; 38 being normal. They decided to quarantine him; his row; the rows in front and back of him; and something like 6 flight attendants; who had served him. One of them told a language speaker that a doctor was coming and would check him on board.  After about 20 minutes; the station manager finally showed up and said that to protect their departure on the 13th; the Chinese authorities would accept just one Flight Attendant. She didn't want to speak to me; and tried to ignore me; but I got involved in the conversation and asked where the doctor was; since this boy was only a fraction of a degree above normal; which may be normal for him. She didn't have a clue; and suddenly didn't seem to understand English anymore.  The purser and I asked her how they were going to determine which Flight Attendant would be quarantined. She said we should choose. We both said we would not do that; that we had no right to order someone to go into quarantine. She said then she would choose. When I asked her what she would do when that person refused; she again didn't understand English. I guess she's not used to people not obeying her.  Finally; the Purser said he would stay. I applaud him for doing that; but what makes this even more bizarre is that he never came into contact with the boy. I asked that station manager why not just send a customer service agent to go with the quarantined people; since they are local and speak the language. She didn't seem to understand my question...again.  Now here's the safety issue:  One of our crew members; who was completely healthy; was forced to go to a non-western hotel; where sick people were being held in quarantine; and given no bottled water (only purification tablets to use with tap water). What if he now gets sick?,,,,An air carrier Captain reported a verbal clash between bio-hazard personnel in ZSPD and flight attendants who had been exposed to a young man who was being quarantined due to the possibility he may have an infectious disease.,"The incident occurred at ZSPD when a young boy with a temperature of 38.7°C was quarantined, along with his row and six flight attendants who had served him. Biohazard personnel, led by a station manager, enforced these measures. The manager initially stated that only one flight attendant could depart, causing a conflict with the flight crew. The crew refused to select someone for quarantine, leading the manager to decide. The purser volunteered to stay, despite not being in contact with the boy. The Captain questioned why a customer service agent couldn't accompany the quarantined individuals, but the manager didn't respond. A safety concern arose as a healthy crew member was sent to a hotel with sick individuals, provided only with purification tablets and tap water. The purser's decision to stay and the Captain's suggestion for customer service involvement highlighted the need for improved quarantine protocols.",crew-related issues

During briefing I sat next to the aft purser and I smelled alcohol on his breath. I spoke with my flying partner as I was unsure what course of action to take. Once I boarded the plane I spoke with the purser and said I smelled alcohol on the Aft Purser's breath and she said; 'Yes I did also and I said something to him.' When I asked how he reacted she said he really didn't react. As we began boarding I became more uncomfortable about the lack of action taken regarding this. I spoke again with my flying partner and he agreed I needed to tell the Captain and the First Officer.  The Captain asked to have the Purser sent up to the cockpit. She spoke with both pilots and confirmed what I had said and that she; too; had smelled alcohol on his breath. She also stated it was difficult in her culture to be assertive with a Japanese man. The Captain asked her to send up the Aft Purser. As the Purser and I exited the cockpit she pulled me aside and said; 'why did you have to say anything'? Now I was feeling extremely uncomfortable. I started to shake; wishing I hadn't said anything.  The last thing I wanted to do as an out of base crewmember is alienate my flying partners. The Aft Purser spoke with the cockpit; then proceeded throughout the flight to not speak to me and to get the aft galley's needed supplies through other flight attendants. I went back to the cockpit and the Captain advised me that since the Aft Purser had popped a mint prior to entering the cockpit he couldn't really smell alcohol and that he didn't notice any unusual behavior such as slurred speech or stumbling and he was OK with him flying. I told the Captain whatever he decided was fine with me; I was just doing my job and keeping everyone apprised of the situation in case anything happened. If I had taken the Purser position in briefing the outcome would have been different. I would have confronted the Aft Purser in the office and given him 2 choices ... go on sick leave or we go talk to the domicile manager or supervisor. I feel this situation was completely downplayed and I was made to feel like I was making a big thing out of nothing and this is unacceptable as a safety professional.,,,,Believing the Aft Purser to have been drinking alcohol; a Flight Attendant is distressed that she failed to receive support from her cabin crewmates for her pleas for investigation prior to departure.,"An incident occurred on a flight where a flight attendant detected the smell of alcohol on the Aft Purser during briefing. Concerned for safety, she discussed her observations with her flying partner and later informed the Captain and First Officer. The Captain requested the Aft Purser to the cockpit, where the Purser confirmed smelling alcohol but stated the Aft Purser didn't exhibit signs of intoxication. The Captain allowed the Aft Purser to fly, citing the use of a mint and no visible signs of impairment. The Aft Purser potentially being under the influence of alcohol, detected by a flight attendant.The flight attendant addressed her concerns with crew and management, leading to a cockpit consultation. The Aft Purser denied impairment, and the Captain permitted him to fly. The flight attendant felt unsupported and disrespected, while the Aft Purser avoided her, highlighting crew dynamics and cultural barriers. The main character felt her concerns were dismissed, indicating a potential flaw in handling safety issues. She proposed a direct approach if in a leadership role, suggesting a need for stronger protocols to ensure safety and crew support.This incident underscores the challenges in addressing safety concerns within a crew, emphasizing the importance of clear procedures and respectful communication to ensure passenger safety.",crew-related issues

They were looking at seat ABX and asked if the armrest came up.  I informed them that it did not; but that the one on ABY did.  They were happy because they were able to switch seats making me realize that they were ticketed for seats ABXY and the man was unable to get into the seat without the armrest coming up.  I located the button and lifted the armrest.  Afterwards I immediately called another attendant to inform her that we very likely had a passenger that qualified under the company's new rule about passengers of size.  She was the attendant greeting passengers and she would be the first one to have contact with a customer service agent to inform them of the problem. The flight was booked oversold by 12.  Therefore we pretty much knew the flight would be full when addressing the passenger of size issue.  The customer service agents came down to the plane later in the boarding process to check carry-on bags.  As soon as I could get through the aisle I spoke to one of them about the passenger of size.  Instead of taking care of the problem themselves they immediately called for a supervisor to handle it.  During this time there were two customer service agents at the plane but none of them would approach the passenger until a supervisor finally showed up. One of the agents did eventually go speak to the passenger about having to take a later flight.  She returned to the boarding door to tell us that the passenger did not want to take a later flight.  They were then going to remove two non-revenue space available passengers who were sitting together towards the front of the plane.  They were going to move the passenger of size to the two seats. Again the agent went back to tell the passenger and again she returned this time saying that the passenger did not want to switch seats.  She then added that if he did not want to change seats we could not force him to do so.  This directly contradicts the company's passenger of size policy. The purser made me feel guilty when they tried to remove the non-revenue space available passengers from the flight.  I also felt guilty since my intention was not to have anyone unrelated to the situation removed from the flight.  However this was both a policy and safety issue.  Multiple people (employees) asked if any of the passengers near the passenger of size had complained which they had not.  The response that I got was that I was creating the problem and that if no one complained it was not even an issue. Again this is contradictory to the passenger of size policy.  The criteria are not based on whether anyone complains.  It is based on safety issues.  The customer service agents did not seem to want to do anything about it and I was being made to feel that I was creating a problem and why was I doing that?  I finally gave in and dropped the issue.  They shut the door and all of the passengers remained in their original seats. As a result of this passenger's size and the seat that he was in (that he refused to move from) the aisle armrest was up for the entire flight including for taxi; take-off and landing.  This was very frustrating.  The company has a policy in place to prevent this.  Instead of following it I was made to feel as if I had created a problem by almost everyone involved from the customer service agents to the customer service supervisor and even by one of my flying partners. Also as part of the policy both the customer service agents and flight attendants are supposed to be proactive.  In this case it was an oversold flight.  It is almost impossible that the customer service agents did not notice his size during boarding.  It makes me wonder why they did not look into the issue at that point.  During the flight half of the passenger's body was out in the aisle.  I tripped over him (he was genuinely apologetic). At another point during the flight there was a traffic jam of passengers in the aisle because they could not get by this passenger.  The thought that came to mind was that if there was a medical emergency I was not sure if we would be able to quickly get down the aisle because half of this person's body was in the aisle. If policy was followed this situation never would have occurred.  Instead I was made to feel guilty and treated as if I was creating a problem because I wanted to follow safety and policy.,,,,Flight Attendant reports she received no support when she attempted to invoke the airline's policy regarding passengers of size.,"The incident occurred on an oversold flight where a passenger of size caused seating issues. The flight attendant attempted to address the problem by switching seats and informing customer service agents, but they did not proactively resolve the situation, leading to the armrest remaining up throughout the flight. This resulted in safety concerns and a congested aisle. The attendant felt unsupported and guilted by the customer service team, despite the company's policy to prevent such situations.",crew-related issues

I noted he was very excited; speaking with a difficult to understand accent; and coughing. I got out of my seat to look through the cockpit door peephole and witnessed the front several rows of passengers reaching for their masks and covering their mouths to breath. The First Officer declared an emergency with ATC and we immediately diverted to the nearest suitable airport. Total descent time was approx. 6-7 minutes. After landing it was determined that the fumes had decreased and the air had cleared. We taxied to the gate; deplaned and notified company of our location and situation.,Reporter stated that four passengers were taken to the hospital for examination and were released. Later investigation determined that a single passenger; an employee of another airline; had smelled something 'unusual' and decided to unilaterally access her PSU manually to obtain oxygen masks for herself and a companion. Doing so actuated the oxygen generator; alarmed other passengers; who attempted to access masks for themselves; engaged the concern of the Flight Attendants who attempted to assist them in accessing their oxygen masks; which resulted in more O2 generators being activated; more heat generated and the generation of a white haze; a by-product of the high heat emitted by the generators.  By the time the Cabin Attendants advised the Flight Crew the air at the top of the cabin was; indeed; full of 'smoke'; the passengers were scrambling to access their masks and the reporting Flight Attendant was alarmed and wearing a portable O2 mask while attempting to transmit on the interphone. The combined effect when viewed through the cockpit peep hole was of a near panic situation with visible smoke in the cabin.  The result was the declaration of the emergency and the diversion to the nearest suitable airport.,,,An A319 declared an emergency and diverted due to smoke in the cabin.,"The incident occurred when an A319 aircraft experienced the automatic deployment of oxygen masks in the front cabin section due to toxic fumes and haze.

I didn't feel comfortable flying on a plane that I wasn't able to access the cockpit for emergency basis on for SAFETY. I called the crew desk immediately to inform them of my SAFETY concerns. I have been charged with a Did Not Fly action and delay of the aircraft for my SAFETY concerns.

The Flight Attendant noticed a maintenance defect on the keypad entry system to the cockpit, which was inoperative and rendered the cockpit door inaccessible from the cabin side. This raised safety concerns, as the Flight Attendant would be unable to access the cockpit in an emergency. The Flight Attendant informed the purser about their concerns, who then contacted maintenance. Maintenance responded by stating that the pilot could provide a code for alternative access, but during a briefing with the Captain, it was clarified that no such alternative access was available under emergency conditions. Uncomfortable with the safety risk, the Flight Attendant contacted the crew desk to report their concerns. As a result, the Flight Attendant was charged with a ""Did Not Fly"" action, leading to a delay in the aircraft. The Flight Attendant expressed hope that the safety issue would be addressed administratively to prevent similar situations in the future.

Spoke to the Purser about this because there had been no information for passenger on oxygen on our briefing sheet. Later a passenger service representative boarded; letting us know that; indeed; we would have a passenger on oxygen. Fortunately; the agent had seen the passenger in the boarding area and saw that the passenger would not be using a nasal cannula but a trachea cannula instead. Everything on the aircraft had been incorrectly set up for a nasal cannula.  The agent redid the hoses and explained how to change the tanks.  The passenger was with his family and a paramedic in the boarding area but the paramedic was not allowed to board per a TSA officer even though the Captain had allowed it.  So; five minutes before departure the passenger is hastily boarded; along with his wife and 2 daughters who are traveling with him. I am given no additional/further medical information and am trying to communicate with people who speak limited English. One of the daughters questions me if the flight goes all the way to Vietnam. I tell her the flight number does but that everyone needs to deplane in VHHH. She becomes worried and says her father needs to stay on the oxygen and that they had been told that they wouldn't have to deplane. She makes a quick phone call and I speak to the Doctor. She is concerned about the VHHH stop because they had NOT been told about this. I assured them that they would have oxygen in VHHH and that everything was already taken care of because the computer booking would have alerted someone that this wasn't a nonstop flight. The doors were already closed at this time so I told the daughter that we would follow through and confirm with VHHH later on during the flight. I spoke with the Purser about this and we both felt it was important to follow up with VHHH because everything else related to our passenger had been very unorganized and mismanaged. Luckily; we had a Flight Attendant that spoke Vietnamese.  I asked her to speak to the family after takeoff and reassure them that the oxygen would have already been prearranged in VHHH.  Later; when the Vietnamese literate Flight Attendant was on her break; our passenger needed to use the bathroom.  I tried to communicate with the family to see how long he could be without oxygen and I couldn't really get a straight answer because of the language barrier. I erred on the side of caution and we strapped a portable oxygen bottle around the daughter who was assisting her father to the bathroom. The Purser had communicated to the cockpit the need for verification that we would have oxygen for the passenger in VHHH. Eventually; the cockpit received a message that the passenger had been advised in their PNR that there would be no oxygen in VHHH!!!!! And if they need it; it would be $250 USD. The Vietnamese speaker spoke to the family and they became a bit upset because here we are getting close to landing and we are making last minute arrangements for oxygen. Upon landing someone comes down the aisle with an aisle wheel chair and no oxygen. I had to forcefully let them know our passenger could not be moved without oxygen. The Purser; myself and a few of the economy flight attendants stayed on board for 40 minutes with the passenger and his family while company customer service representatives explained to the family that the price of the oxygen would be around $500 USD!!!!! This was due to the cost of a Doctor or Nurse needing to be there and there was a minimum charge for a set number of hours. The family became very distressed. The father was on his deathbed and this was his last flight so he could die in Vietnam and they had been given wrong information. It was devastating for us to see how poorly this family had been treated by our Company. More importantly; it was dangerous that someone didn't follow throughproperly. This family was basically shoved on the airplane without proper medical information ever being gathered and placed in his computer record and communicated to the crew.  Subsequently; the paramedic should have been allowed to board.  By to let the paramedic board; important medical information was not able to be conveyed to the crew due to the language barrier.,,,,A Purser relates her concerns about the services provided a passenger traveling with special medical needs.,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",crew-related issues

My flying partner was behind me in the cabin and I assumed she would arm both upper deck doors as I disposed of the glasses and cleaned and secured the galley in preparation for departure. I was not aware that she had left the upper deck.  After the safety video was finished I checked the cabin; closing some sidewall bins checking seats and seatbelts and instructing a few passengers seated by the exits to open the window shades. I double checked the galley then sat in my jumpseat and fastened my seatbelt. My flying partner was still back in the galley area at this point and I asked her to double check to make sure the window shades by the exit were open. After take-off I noticed the window shades were still down so I went up to her jumpseat and quietly told her why the window shades had to be open. She said she forgot; then she thanked me for arming the doors for take off. I looked up at the door and was horrified to see it was not armed and the other door was also disarmed.  We armed the doors and I reported it to the cockpit and the purser. Full staffing for the upper deck is two flight attendants--one committed to the aisle; the other in the galley. It is hard work in the best of circumstances and doubly so when one attendant is not working at 100%. In this particular situation I realized in the first few minutes of working together before passenger boarding that I would be doing much of her work in addition to all of mine. This proved to be the case when passengers started to board.  While organizing the galley; talking with the cockpit crew regarding meals and security I was also hanging coats; stowing luggage in the closet and serving predeparture beverages. By the time the 'prepare for departure' announcement was made it seemed like I was going in 10 different directions. The door at upper deck right was my assignment. I did the preflight safety check according to the manual when I boarded and it was my responsibility to either arm the door for departure or make sure it was armed. I failed to do this on this day. I can assure you I double checked the door was disarmed upon arrival at our destination; armed for our departure home and disarmed after our arrival.,,,,A B747-400 flight attendant assumed her flying partner would arm her assigned emergency exit when she was busy with other duties.  So did her flying partner.  The flight took off with two exits disarmed.,"The incident involved two flight attendants on a B747-400 aircraft who both assumed their responsibilities for arming the emergency exit doors were covered by the other. During predeparture preparations, one flight attendant was focused on cleaning and securing the galley, while the other was assisting with passenger seating and safety checks. Neither ensured the doors were armed, leading to the aircraft taking off with both upper deck doors disarmed. Upon realizing the mistake, they armed the doors, informed the cockpit, and completed the flight safely. The flight attendant later reflected on the need for clearer communication and task allocation to prevent such oversights in the future.",crew-related issues

The aircraft was a non-bunk airplane and has two first class seats for pilot rest and coach seats for flight attendant rest.  After stowing my bags above the flight crew rest seats I proceeded to the cockpit and the Captain handed me the window shades for the cockpit and told me to find a place to store them as he did not have enough room in the closet in the cockpit.  I went to the pilot designated storage areas above the flight crew rest seats and did not find any room to store the shades.  I then attempted to return to the cockpit and found the galley Flight Attendant trying to store her bags in the closet aft of the cockpit.  I was waiting for her to finish so I could return to the cockpit and put the window shades under the second observers seat.  While waiting the galley Flight Attendant looked up and said; 'those won't fit in my closet'; referring to the shades.  I said; 'I don't want to put them in there'.  Still waiting she said; 'You didn't hear me; those won't fit in my closet!'  I said; 'Again; I don't want to put them in YOUR closet.'  She finally was finished and I secured the shades in the cockpit.  The other relief pilot asked what happened because the galley Flight Attendant said; 'I hope he doesn't plan on eating tonight.'  This is a 13+ hour flight and I wanted to try and address the issue with the galley Flight Attendant.  As I went to the galley to speak with her another Flight Attendant said; 'You better not push her buttons; she controls your food!'  Having been told twice by both Flight Attendants working in First Class I realized they were serious about tampering with my food.  This is why I chose to not eat during this 13+ hour flight.,,,,After what he describes as an abrasive yet; ultimately; innocuous exchange with a flight attendant regarding a misunderstanding about storage on a long range flight; a B777-200 First Officer felt threatened by flight attendant comments about their control of his in flight meals.  He; therefore chose not to eat a meal on the over thirteen hour flight.,"A conflict arose between a First Officer and a Flight Attendant on an international flight involving a misunderstanding regarding the storage of window shades. The First Officer was tasked with storing the shades but found no available space in the designated areas. While waiting for the Flight Attendant to finish organizing her bags, a verbal exchange occurred, during which the Flight Attendant expressed frustration about the storage of the shades. The First Officer, attempting to resolve the issue, was subsequently warned by other Flight Attendants about potential interference with his in-flight meals. Concerned about the safety and availability of his food, the First Officer chose not to eat during the 13+-hour flight. No formal solution was proposed or implemented during the incident.",crew-related issues

Ultimately; a mutiny occurred. Purser flew as passenger to avoid cancellation. On southbound leg; several verbal exchanges of words led the Captain and First Officer 1 and First Officer 2 to conclude that several flight attendants (not all) had little respect for Captain authority. At one point Purser walked away from Captain during a conversation involving safety issues. During layover; Captain made decision to replace Purser with another Flight Attendant. Captain ordered initial Purser to work in coach (or at least not as Purser) but the Purser refused to follow Captain's orders.  Captain and First Officers agreed we could not work with this Flight Attendant and requested that a Flight Operations Manager remove him from flight. Ultimately; the remaining flight attendants wanted to walk if Purser was removed from aircraft. All agreed that they felt the Captain was unsafe if Purser was removed.  Pilot talked to the Flight Operations Manager on a conference call and decided to allow Purser to fly as passenger. Purser agreed to ride as passenger. Flight Attendants never recanted on their reference to the unsafe feature regarding the Captain. Second Purser took over. Northbound flight was uneventful. This was simply a communal lack of respect of Captain's authority culminating in a mutiny. At no time was safety compromised. Pilots felt that they could not depend on the Purser; certainly in an emergency.,,,,A B767-300 Captain reported a complete breakdown in communications between the Flight Crew and the Cabin Crew.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and cabin crew on a B767-300 aircraft, primarily centered on a breakdown in communication and respect for the Captain's authority. The issue escalated when the Purser, a senior cabin crew member, refused to comply with the Captain's orders, leading to a decision by the Captain and First Officers to request the removal of the Purser from the flight. This decision was met with resistance from other flight attendants, who expressed concerns about the Captain's safety if the Purser was removed. After a conference call with the Flight Operations Manager, it was agreed that the Purser would fly as a passenger on the remainder of the journey rather than continue in his role. The remaining flight attendants maintained their stance that they could not work safely under the Captain's authority if the Purser was removed. The flight resumed without further issues, with the second Purser taking over duties. No safety compromise occurred during the incident, but the Captain expressed concerns about the cabin crew's ability to work effectively in an emergency.",crew-related issues

They said that they could hear us but all I could hear was a clicking sound. I reported this to the cockpit. They responded that our destination did not have Maintenance. After landing the #2 and I ran downstairs for a quick smoke while the plane was being cleaned. Upon returning for boarding I asked the Captain about the communication problem. He once again stated that they don't have Maintenance here. I then asked him 'What if we have a problem in the back of the aircraft.' He replied 'I can hear you so I can click once for yes and twice for no.' I realized later how foolish I was not to have walked off the plane at that time. After takeoff the #2 got out her manual and of course there it was under malfunctions. 'Airline can not dispatch a flight if all cockpit cabin interphones are inoperative.' While deplaning at our destination I was the #2 talking on the Captain on the way off the plane. The only thing I said to him was 'It's a no-go item' as I left. I realize that everyone would like their trips to stay on schedule. What I do not understand is a cockpit crew willing to put both their flight crew and their passengers at risk. I thank God that there were not any problems on our return flight. I shudder to think what could have happened if we did.,,,,A MD80 Flight Attendant reported the Cockpit/Cabin interphone system was inoperative during flight. After landing; the Captain did not request contract Maintenance and the flight departed with a non-MEL item inoperative.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding the inoperative cockpit/cabin interphone system on an MD80 aircraft. The flight attendant reported that the interphone system was non-functional during the flight, as she could only hear a clicking sound and could not communicate properly with the cockpit. Despite her concerns, the captain stated that the destination did not have maintenance and that the flight could proceed. The flight attendant later discovered in the manual that the aircraft should not be dispatched if all interphone systems were inoperative. She raised this issue with the captain upon deplaning, emphasizing the risk to both the crew and passengers.

I did taxi slowly and I thought that she should have had enough time to complete her before takeoff announcements.  While taxing to the runway we were cleared into position and hold before the before takeoff checklist was completed.  As I approached the runway; my First Officer advised the Tower that we needed 10 more seconds.  Tower told us to hold short; but I was unable to stop the aircraft before about 5 feet of the nose was past the hold short line.  Tower called to have us read back the hold short instructions; which I did as the First Officer was now asking the Flight Attendant if she was ready for takeoff.  She said that she was and that she thought that she had chimed us.  During this time; I was talking to Tower to tell them that we were in fact beyond the hold short line.  Tower then told the inbound flight to go around.  The First Officer then advised me that the Flight Attendant was ready for takeoff.  We were then cleared into position and hold.  Tower then cleared us for takeoff and the flight proceeded without incident.  I was concentrating on the Tower's instructions and taxiing the aircraft.

The flight crew reported that the taxi out from the gate to Runway 30R was shorter than expected, and the flight attendant was believed to have had sufficient time to complete her pre-takeoff announcements. However, the flight crew did not inform the flight attendant that the taxi out was short. While taxing to the runway, the flight crew was cleared into position and hold before completing the before-takeoff checklist. The First Officer requested an additional 10 seconds, but the Tower instructed the aircraft to hold short. The aircraft was unable to stop before its nose crossed the hold short line by approximately 5 feet. The Tower then instructed the flight attendant to read back the hold short instructions, and the flight attendant indicated she was ready for takeoff, believing she had completed her announcements. The Tower subsequently cleared an inbound flight to go around due to the aircraft's position.

I continued to perform my duties to the best of my abilities during boarding and takeoff. After the boarding door was closed I was asked by the flight crew if I was alright. I told them I didn't know but I thought I would be okay & able to perform my duties. After the safety demo was done; I went to the lavatory where I dealt with vomiting & diarrhea. I was experiencing unbearable stomach cramps also. I had to go to the lav at least every 5 or so minutes. I got a call from the captain and was asked how I was doing. I told him I wasn't doing well at all and wouldn't be able to do an inflight service. I was asked if we needed to make an emergency landing. I told him I thought I could at least make it to our destination. After that phone call; I had to go back to the lav. At that point in time I was very weak & dizzy and couldn't make it back up to my jumpseat. So I retreated to the nearest seat. I left my jumpseat out the entire flight to create some sort of barrier between the cabin and the flight deck. A passenger came up to me and told me he was a former EMT & wanted to take my vital signs. He said I wasn't in the best shape but I would be okay. I asked him to call the flight deck and let them know what was going on with me. He then returned and told me we were about 30 minutes out from our destination and we would be landing soon. Once we landed; EMTs boarded the aircraft and assisted me into the terminal via wheelchair. My vital signs were taken and I told them the symptoms of how I was feeling. They told me it sounded like I had food poisoning and there wasn't much they or a hospital could do for me. They advised against going to the hospital. I was contacted by my manager and crew scheduling. I was told I was taken off my trip and my manager had me go to the airport clinic to be evaluated. The doctor at the clinic diagnosed me with food poisoning and told me not to fly anywhere that night or the next morning. He also said there was nothing he could prescribe me and that the illness would have to run its course. The next time I am ill to the point of not being able to perform my duties and I know well ahead of time I will definitely call crew scheduling and my manager and let them know immediately. I will also get to some sort of urgent care facility as quickly as possible. I should have called as soon as I started showing signs of illness. I understand also that it is a major problem with me being the only flight attendant on duty and not being able to be in the proper state of mind and body to effectively perform my duties.,,Flight Attendant got progressively sicker during flight to the point of a passenger needing to help fill in for her duties. I briefed the First Officer on the situation and he had heard some of it. I said we needed to find in the FOM/POM reference to flight attendant incapacitation. I could find no reference in POM index for flight attendant or incapacitation. First Officer eventually found it.I told her if she was not feeling well or felt worse to brief a passenger on the use of the interphone and have them contact the flight deck. ... with approximately 50 minutes left in the flight at FL340 I received an interphone call from the cabin from a passenger on board saying the flight attendant was ill. He identified himself as a pilot and EMT. I asked the status of our Flight Attendant and he said she was conscious with a good pulse and good breathing and aside from being sick to the stomach had good vitals.I briefed the passenger initially on the interphone use and if a chime was heard pick up the phone and if her condition changed to call us ... At some point I went in the back and briefed the EMT that if he believed the flight attendant could not adequate perform her duties to relocate the her to a passenger seat and that he needed to sit in the FA jumpseat per FOM 'Flight Attendant Incapacitation' procedures. He accepted and I briefed him on opening the door stowing the Flight Attendant jumpseat upon arrival at the gate and going over securing the cabin for arrival.,,A CRJ900 flight crew must make difficult decisions when the sole flight attendant aboard is incapacitated by food poisoning.,"A flight attendant on a CRJ900 aircraft became incapacitated due to food poisoning, which manifested with symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, and severe cramps.
