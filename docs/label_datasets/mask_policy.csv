The first class wasn't even deplaned. Only three people had deplaned while others were trying to get their bag down and deplane. I said no not at this point; which in turn the first cleaner gave me serious attitude. The Gate Agent came down; no mask on; with an attitude about us not letting the cleaners enter to clean. They had 12 people to clean; usually they have a shortage of cleaners. But we hadn't even had first class passengers cleared and they started coming on. I asked not yet; let the passengers deplane and this flight is a full flight. This is becoming a serious issue at times and passengers getting upset they can't deplane and usually the cleaners keep cleaning and not moving in so they can deplane. Understand at this time with COVID the importance of cleaning but passengers complain at me about cleaners not clearing so the could deplane. It's stressful enough with all we are dealing with no food drinks and upset passengers about what they can't have. Our passengers were moving quick and not stalling getting off.  When they were off we couldn't get our bags and personal items together.  The flight deck wasn't able to exit. I understand there is time a limit and all but this rushing is going to seriously cause problems with safety of crew and passengers.  I was wrong possibly and maybe for which i will follow these memo's I forgot about from now on. Just trying to give our paying passengers a pleasant and safe flight including safe deplaning.,,,,Flight Attendant reported there was no social distancing by the aircraft cleaners during deplaning and also stated the Gate Agent was not wearing a face mask.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and ground personnel during the deplaning process of a full flight. The cleaning crew requested early access to clean the first-class section before all passengers had deplaned, which the flight attendant initially refused. This led to tension, as the cleaning crew and a gate agent, who arrived without a face mask, displayed an attitude. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of passenger safety and deplaning efficiency, citing stress from COVID-related protocols and passenger concerns. After deplaning was complete, the crew faced delays in retrieving their belongings, and the flight deck remained inaccessible. The flight attendant acknowledged potential oversights and expressed a commitment to follow procedures, highlighting the need for safe and efficient passenger experiences.",mask policy

We had power (i.e. lights) but; we did not have any airflow (air conditioning). We were beginning to sweat profusely. I (FA) contacted the terminal Supervisor who patched me through to Agent; in the tower. I told him of our plight and passenger complaints and concerns. He said he would send someone immediately to turn on the air. This was approximately 20 minutes later. About 15-20 minutes later we still had no air. Passengers were getting very upset and many took their masks off. We made announcements stating that without airflow; it was even more important to keep their mask on since they could not social distance. I contacted the Supervisor again and insisted the passengers be let off the aircraft if we were not going to get airflow and we still didn't know anything about when the pilots would arrive. Approximately 10 minutes later the pilots boarded and stated we should never have begun boarding under those conditions. They got air up and we departed 15 minutes later. 1 hour and 10 minutes after boarding. I felt very; very unsafe in those conditions as did many passengers.We should never board without air conditioning during COVID. If the pilots are running late; a mechanic should be brought down to turn on the air. A few minutes would be acceptable but when the tower is contacted; something should be done in a timely manner. Flight attendants should be allowed to let passengers deplane under such extreme conditions where everyone's safety and health are put at risk.,,,,Flight Attendant reported passengers were boarded before the pilots arrived at the aircraft. No air conditioning was available and passengers began removing their face masks.,"An incident occurred during a flight involving a misunderstanding between the flight attendant (Y) and the flight crew. After the doors closed, Y approached her colleague (X) to inform her of a disruptive passenger who refused to wear a mask. Y dealt with the passenger while X closed the doors and made an announcement, with both stating the cabin was secure. However, X assumed Y would finish her duties, and Y believed X had secured the cabin. The confusion arose when the captain opened the flight deck door, expecting the cabin to be secure but was unaware of the status. Both realized their mutual assumption led to the oversight. They re-secured the cabin and resumed the briefing, causing a delay. The incident was caused by both parties' distractions and mutual assumptions, highlighting the need for clearer communication protocols to prevent such misunderstandings. Implementing a check system or specific confirmation procedure could enhance future operations.",mask policy

I told her I would go to the back while she checked the doors for me. I went to handle the passenger and she did closed doors and made the announcement. We both said cabin secure. I noticed the flight deck door was closed and had assumed she had done cabin secure for me seeing as I was tending to this passenger and she had done door closure for me. I continued on with the safety briefing. Approximately one minute into the safety briefing the Captain opened the flight deck door to inform me that no one informed him of cabin secure. Me and Flight Attendant X both became aware that we had assumed the other person had secured the cabin door and quickly re-secured the cabin. We continued on with our briefing.I believe we both made the mistake because of the destructive passenger. I had assumed that while I was tending to this passenger she had took over all of my duties and she assumed that I was going to finish my duties once I got back up into the gallery. I also believe the pilots close the door on their own to keep warm which is why we had gotten confused on the door being close.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being distracted by a disruptive passenger and forgetting to advise the flight crew the cabin was secure and they were ready to depart.,"The incident involved a misunderstanding between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding the cabin security process. The flight attendant was distracted by a disruptive passenger who refused to wear a mask, leading to an oversight in communication. After addressing the passenger, the flight attendant assumed the flight crew had been informed that the cabin was secure. Similarly, the flight crew believed the flight attendant had communicated the cabin's readiness. This mutual assumption resulted in the cabin not being properly secured before the safety briefing began. Approximately one minute into the briefing, the captain noticed the lack of communication and informed the flight attendant, prompting both parties to re-secure the cabin promptly. The incident was attributed to the distraction caused by the disruptive passenger and the crew's assumption that the other party had handled their respective duties. A potential solution identified was to improve communication protocols and account for habits like the pilots closing the flight deck door for warmth.",mask policy

The cleaning crew were at the front door (1Left) trying to get on the plane while the passengers were leaving; and the pilots were also trying to gather their bags and leave. This made the situation very chaotic. I was not aware of it being a 'quick-turn'; as I am always happy to try and help out with the quick-turn cleaning.The cleaners slipped on a few at a time; in between passengers leaving. I saw the two aft crewmembers with their luggage; and moving forward through the cabin; towards me. The cleaners were already onboard; cleaning throughout the plane. I said; 'last but not least!' to the final passenger; thanked her and gathered my belongings. I looked back and only saw the cleaners; and my crew who were almost to me. I didn't see any more passengers and thought we were done. I double-checked my doors and the forward lavatory and stepped off the plane. When the aft crew stepped off; there was a male passenger with them who had been mixed in with the cleaners. He did not have his boarding pass with him. He said he wouldn't leave without it; and that his seat was XX6. He wanted to go look for it himself; but crew went to look. His boarding card was found under his seat.A contributing factor is having so many people onboard/in jetbridge and the cleaning crew coming onboard (sometimes in just sweatshirts; hoodies; jackets; hats; masks; etc.) and mixing in with disembarking passengers; and vice versa.  Flights are more full now; and anyone can be mistaken for a cleaner.Other factors: double-checking the passengers haven't lowered or removed their masks; as they often do now; as they are coming down the aisle towards me and the boarding door. The passengers are trying to look down the aisle and gauge how far we've gotten with the row announcements to deplane. Also; 2-3 pilots using the lavatory; gathering bags and leaving; while passengers are disembarking causes more confusion. All of this; and the extra amount of ground-staff/cleaners onboard and in the jet-bridge in civilian clothing; causes more confusion; multitasking/load at the boarding/deplaning door.I assumed the last passenger I saw; and said goodbye to; was our final passenger onboard.I would not have stepped off the plane had I known there was still one passenger onboard.I will also alert corporate security to this incident; and the added potential for this confusion during disembarkation.,,,,Flight Attendant reported the aircraft cleaners were slipping onboard to clean the aircraft before the passengers were completely off. One last passenger; resembling a cleaner; remained intermixed with crew and cleaners during the crew's exit.,"A conflict occurred between a flight attendant (Party 1) and ground personnel (Party 2) during the disembarkation process of a flight at ZZZ airport. The incident arose due to a ""quick-turn"" operation, where the cleaning crew boarded the aircraft before all passengers had disembarked. This led to confusion as passengers, cleaning staff, and crew members were moving through the cabin simultaneously. The flight attendant was unaware of the situation escalating, as she was focused on her usual duties, including calling rows to deplane and ensuring passenger safety. During the process, she noticed the cleaning crew slipping onboard in casual attire, which blended them in with passengers and crew. Pilots were also leaving the aircraft, adding to the chaos. The flight attendant assumed all passengers had disembarked after seeing the last passenger, who resembled a cleaner, and stepped off the plane. However, a male passenger had remained onboard, intermixed with the cleaning crew and crew members. He was eventually found after his boarding pass was located under his seat. Contributing factors included the quick turnaround procedure, the lack of distinction in clothing between cleaning staff and other individuals onboard, and the presence of multiple ground staff and crew members in the jet-bridge and cabin. The flight attendant noted that double-checking passengers and crew for proper identification could help prevent such confusion in the future. She also expressed concerns about passengers removing or lowering their masks, which could further complicate the deplaning process. As a result of the incident, the flight attendant planned to alert corporate security to the situation and the potential for similar confusion during future disembarkations.",mask policy

It was a busy time in the flight deck where I was trying to manage the safety of the push. The FO answered the call to the flight deck from the cabin while I was talking to the ground crew and ramp was talking to our flight and the flight next to us pushing off the gate. The ramp personnel had left several pieces of ground equipment in the way of our push from X1 and we were trying to find out about getting it moved. As all of that is going on the narrative that myself and the FO got from the FA seemed to be one of more a compliance with the mask policy than one of weight and balance. She told us there was a large child sitting in a seat for which they were ticketed next to their mother and the child was having a hard time wearing the mask. The FA told us that the mother was now saying the child was less than 2. The FA believed that the mother was saying the child was less than 2 to skirt our mask policy and we needed to change the count for weight and balance because the child was an infant. I tried to clarify with the FA about the child because it was not clear to me because she was telling me the child was not listed as an infant; had their own seat; and by the FAs thought it was more about the mask. My thinking was that for the child to have that seat a birth date would have to be listed when that seat was purchased. Previously the FAs and the gate agent had reconciled the count; and the FA thought the child was older than 2; so I elected to leave the weight and balance as it stood. We continued to our destination without further incident.It was a busy time in the flight deck when this issue was brought to my attention. After things had calmed down with push I should have checked back with the FA to make sure I was hearing everything she was trying to tell me. Factors for me with my decision making were the high workload at the time; alertness because of the late time of day of the departure and having been scheduled with early AM shows for the three days prior to this event.,,I walked through to do my cabin count and confirmed that I had a child in row XX just as it showed on the sheet. I had already asked the mom to get a mask on the child before we closed the weight/balance. She said the child did not have a mask so I brought her one. After the safety demo I walked through the cabin again for final compliance and saw the child was not wearing a mask. Mom said he had ripped it so I offered to get a new one. She then said that the other FA told her he didn't need one if he was under the age of 2. I was surprised to hear the child was an infant as he was quite large and had walked on board the aircraft by himself. I asked if he was still only 1 and she said he was not yet 2. I alerted the CA that I had possibly made a mistake in the count.  I mistakenly counted an infant as a child. I didn't ask how old the child was; it only came up because of non-compliance with mask policy.I honestly think she claimed the child was an infant in order to avoid dealing with the face mask.In the future I will make sure to ask passengers with small children if they are in fact under the age of 2.,,Air carrier Captain and a Flight Attendant reported a passenger's child was resisting wearing a face mask. After this problem started the parent then stated the child was under 2 and did not need to wear the face mask.,"The incident began when a flight attendant reported a passenger's child resisting the face mask policy. The mother claimed the child was under two years old, exempting the child from the mask requirement. The flight attendant believed this was an attempt to avoid compliance and sought to adjust the weight and balance count. The captain, managing a busy pushback and fatigued from early morning hours, decided to maintain the current count, as the child had a designated seat, suggesting the child was over two. Later, the flight attendant realized she had miscounted the child as a passenger rather than an infant, leading her to alert the captain. She concluded the mother had falsely claimed the child's age. Reflecting on the experience, the flight attendant vowed to verify the age of children in such situations in the future. The outcome was resolved without further incident, with the flight attendant learning to ask passengers about their child's age to ensure accurate counts and compliance.",mask policy

This was a direct violation of sterile cockpit procedures. Because flight crews repeatedly experience chimes from the cabin while in simulator training; they are most associated with fire or critical aircraft issues.  This is never a good time to chime the cockpit unless it is an emergency. Especially for a mask compliance issue.Relaxed emphasis from Leadership on the tattling on passengers for improper use of masks (never saw this type of behavior from FA when it came to early seat-belt releases.  Reissued sterile cockpit etiquette with a bulletin on scenario that are and are not acceptable for chiming the cockpit during landing rollout.,,,,Captain reported a Flight Attendant distracted the flight deck crew during the landing rollout to inform them a passenger was not conforming to face mask policy.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant interrupted the sterile cockpit procedure during landing rollout to inform the flight crew about a passenger not complying with the mask policy. This action was contrary to established safety protocols, which reserve cockpit intercom use for emergencies. The flight crew, accustomed to associating such chimes with critical issues, were distracted, potentially compromising safety. The result was a report from the Captain. To address this, guidelines were reissued to clarify acceptable scenarios for cockpit communication during landing, emphasizing the importance of adhering to sterile procedures.",mask policy

During the portion of the demonstration where I had to demonstrate the correct use and application of the demonstration oxygen mask; my own face mask was still on while I was demonstrating how to use the oxygen mask. I realize passengers wearing their own masks could think it would be alright to put the oxygen mask over their face mask based on my incorrect demonstration.I went into my trip misinterpreting and misreading communication regarding face masks; which led me to think I would just need to wear my face mask throughout the flight without understanding that there are exceptions and appropriate situations during which to remove the face mask. While completing my safety demonstration; I do not think I realized I was wearing my face mask as I was demonstrating the use of the demonstration oxygen mask. I believe that I was also narrowly focused on keeping up with the demonstration rather than being situationally aware of the fact that I was still wearing a mask as I went into the oxygen mask demonstration.Looking back on this event; I realize I could have been more aware of myself and my surroundings. Before I started the trip; I simply thought that I would just need to wear my mask for the duration of my flights without comprehending that in certain moments of the flight; such as demonstrating correct use of the oxygen mask; that it would be appropriate to remove my mask in order to safely and accurately show its proper use. I plan to be more situationally aware; realizing that I may need to remove my mask for certain tasks.

The Flight Attendant was concerned that passengers would think it would be acceptable to place an oxygen mask over a personal mask.,"The flight attendant was demonstrating the oxygen mask use during the safety briefing while wearing her own face mask, which could have led passengers to misunderstand the correct procedure.

The mother's refusal to comply with the mask policy led to the incident being reported. The flight completed its journey, but the mother's actions highlighted a compliance issue that the crew had to address during the flight.",mask policy

Passenger X complied initially and we departed without further issue.During cruise F/A B communicated to me that he had asked Passenger X several times to keep his mask on - as he was not eating or drinking.

Lead FA (Purser) stated that none of the FAs were comfortable coming up to the Cockpit unless the remaining pilot (in the cockpit) wore a face covering. As he really needed to use the Lav; the FO consented to the FA's request and then told me (the Captain) of the FA's request. This is the first time in my XX+ years at airline and XY+ years as a Captain; that I've had a FA hold me hostage to get a Lav break. The FA requested that the pilot remaining in the cockpit wear a face covering in the cockpit while the other pilot was absent from the cockpit on the Lav break. I never wear a face covering in the cockpit; while flying the aircraft; especially with the other pilot absent from the cockpit.If it's not already obvious; let me restate that the FARs prohibit the use of a face covering (or the wearing of a beard) that would prevent a proper seal of the O2 mask. At FL400 and a TUC (Time of Useful Consciousness) of 15 seconds; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to find out that your O2 mask doesn't work with a face covering. As the FO left the cockpit; and me wearing a face covering; per the FA's request; ATC gave us a vector off course and a speed reduction for traffic. I replied to ATC; but they couldn't hear my boom mike through the face covering. At FL400; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to find out ATC can't hear your boom mike through the face covering. Before she left; I told the Lead FA that I would be writing a report and she said something through her face covering that I couldn't hear. At FL400; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to be unable to communicate with the only other person in the cockpit.Face coverings are UN-SAFE while taxing; flying; or maneuvering the airplane. They fog up my glasses which I am required to wear; they prevent me from communicating clearly with ATC; the other pilot or with the FA when the other pilot is absent from the cockpit.After the flight; we had a long debrief with the FAs. Company COVID-19 face covering information DOES NOT address the wearing of a face covering while operating an aircraft. The FAs on this flight; believed I was operating the aircraft in disregard of the Federal Aviation Regulations and in direct violation of Company Policy. It was unclear to these FAs; who gets to tell who must wear a face covering while operating an aircraft. None of these FAs seemed to understand who the Pilot-In-Command (PIC) is when operating an aircraft.In the masked de-brief; they were argumentative and confrontational. They thought that the remaining pilot on the cockpit was required to wear an O2 mask anytime the other pilot is absent the cockpit. It is very difficult to discuss face coverings with a FA who's been told that everyone is required to wear a face covering at all times while on an aircraft or on company property. The FAs do not understand the problems caused by face coverings in the cockpit (the O2 mask; Pilot to Pilot or Pilot to ATC communications issues; or Eye Glass fogging). The FAs believe that they can tell the Captain how to operate an aircraft in direct violation of the FARs; safety procedures and common sense. This has to stop. The Company must tell all employees; but especially FAs; that the Captain is in command; that face coverings cause safety issues in the cockpit and that pilots are NOT required (in fact; are discouraged from wearing) face coverings while operating an aircraft.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported that the flight attendants were not comfortable coming into the flight deck while the pilot was on a restroom break; until the remaining pilot was wearing a face mask. Reporter described safety concerns with having to wear a face mask in the cockpit.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and flight attendants regarding the safety protocols for wearing face coverings in the cockpit. Here's a concise summary: During the flight, the First Officer requested a Lavatory break. The Lead Flight Attendant insisted that no flight attendant would enter the cockpit unless the remaining pilot wore a face covering. The Captain complied but was angered, feeling it was unprecedented and unsafe. The Captain highlighted safety issues with face coverings in the cockpit, citing potential problems with oxygen masks, communication with ATC, and fogging of glasses. These concerns were particularly acute at FL400, where quick response times are critical. The use of a face covering muffled communication, leading to difficulties in contacting ATC and the Lead FA, further complicating the situation. Post-landing, the debrief with FAs became confrontational. FAs believed the Captain was violating safety protocols by not wearing a face covering and didn't understand the Captain's authority as PIC. The Captain emphasized the need for clear company policies on face coverings in the cockpit, noting that current COVID-19 guidelines don't address this specific scenario. They stressed the importance of recognizing the PIC's authority and the hazards face coverings pose in the cockpit environment. In conclusion, the incident underscored the need for improved communication, policy clarity, and understanding of safety protocols among all crew members.",mask policy

He reached into his pocket and pulled out the blue surgical mask and held it in his hand and took off with his bags with no mask on his face.

I conveyed what had happed to both FA A and the CA.  Shortly after 10;000 feet as I was heading forward to retrieve a set of headphones for another guest; as I walk by; I find her laying across XX1 and 2 with her head propped up on her book bag on the aisle arm rest; head hanging over into the aisle without a mask.  I tried rousing her quietly with no response from her and then gently tapped her on the shoulder and her exclaiming; 'What?!  What do you want?'  I politely asked her to please put her mask on and cover both her nose and mouth as required and to please ensure her seatbelt remained fastened while the seatbelt sign was on as we were still ascending.  She begrudgingly complied as she continued to complain and others around her asked her to wear it as well.  During service; once again; Passenger X had her mask below her chin as she sat with her foot propped up in the seat and was painting her toenails.  I politely asked her again to comply with the mask requirement and to please not polish her toenails as the fumes were offensive to those around her.  She denied painting her toenails (with polish in an opened [bottle and] nail polish remover pad in hand). I explained to her once again that wearing a mask is a requirement that she had been made aware of prior to boarding and that it wasn't fair to the other passengers and crew on board as everyone else was diligent in complying. I also made her aware that she had been informed several times.  As I started to walk forward to let FA A know what had transpired.  We called the CA and let him know that we were doing and to be prepared in the event that the situation escalated.  The guest in front of her Passenger Y asked if there was something more I could do or move her when suddenly her voice level became elevated and she said 'There!  I pulled the mask up and I have a headache so go away!' Subsequently we (FA A and myself) asked the Passenger Y if he would be more comfortable in another seat and he accepted.  Passenger Y and several other guests commended us for how we handled the situation.  Passenger Y gave his permission for this airline to contact him regarding the situation and events. Passenger X complied for the rest of the flight.  Upon final compliance before landing; Passenger X was asked by both FA A and myself to again stow her bags which she finally did by tossing and kicking them under the seat.  Upon landing she quickly stood; gathered her belongings and hurried off of the plane before rows in front of her stood.  Although we understand the importance of wanting to retain customer loyalty; this kind of behavior should not be tolerated for the sake of one over an entire cabin of guests and employees.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger did not comply with wearing a face mask during flight and exhibited other non-compliant behavior.,"A flight attendant encountered a passenger who repeatedly failed to comply with mask-wearing regulations and other cabin behavior guidelines.

During the flight, Passenger X disregarded these instructions, lying across seats and removing her mask. She also engaged in painting her toenails, despite being asked to stop due to fumes bothering others. When addressed, Passenger X became confrontational, raising her voice and refusing to comply. The flight attendant and crew, including the Chief Attendant, took steps to mitigate the situation, offering alternative seating to affected passengers. Passenger X eventually complied with mask requirements for the remainder of the flight but quickly left the aircraft upon landing.

She moved back. I went back to my FWD jumpseat and called the Captain to tell him we were secure and passenger was back in her seat.

I walked back and there was an open beer bottle can on her tray. I asked her what was in the bottle and asked if it was an X brand beer and alcohol. She said yes and I told her she could not have her alcohol on board.  She asked why but said OK; and I took it and showed the aft FA in the galley then threw it away and immediately called the flight deck.

Passenger in Z4 told the Captain on the jet bridge that she had been saying swear words and how she was going to write a letter to airline and what she was going to do the other FA and I?

The Gate Agent had not briefed the flight attendants on any exemptions; so I looked on EFB and just saw an Infant in XX3. I asked the Forward FA to ask the Gate Agent who was standing in the galley if we had any late exemptions and he advised no. Gate Agent came to back of plane to talk to Passenger X and advised him he would have to wear a mask since there was not an exemption. Passenger X advised he had gotten an exemption in ZZZ1 on way to ZZZ and showed a boarding pass that in ink was written exemption from mask but we had no idea who wrote it. Passenger X then pulled out a letter that only stated he was disabled and that he gets paid a certain amount. Gate Agent was advising it was OK with him for Passenger X to go; but I said no we need to talk to the Captain in regards to this. We went to the Captain who made a phone call and was told passenger would need to get an exemption for our flight. The Gate Agent at that time went to gate to meet a Supervisor and see if anything was in the record. When he came back suddenly there was a record for the passenger with the exemption of taking mask off for XX minute intervals. I then looked at my EFB and now it showed a wheelchair where the infant had been and the infant moved to XX4. We closed up after advising Passenger X of the exemption and the XX minutes only. During the 2 hour 30 minute flight we had to tell Passenger X at least 4 times that he had to put mask on and when he did we had to tell him over his nose and mouth not just his chin. Passenger also had a very disruptive 2 yr old as well; that was coughing and sneezing and Passenger X advised us his children gave him high anxiety and that was why he could not wear mask.Passenger X's total disregard of mask rule and even though he got [an] exemption to take mask off for XX minute intervals he did not follow the exemption.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger would not comply with the face mask policy even though the passenger had a special exemption to take it off for periods at a time.,"During a flight, a passenger (Passenger X) assigned to seat XX3 refused to comply with the face mask policy despite being granted a special exemption to remove the mask for brief intervals. The incident began when the flight attendant noticed Passenger X without a mask during boarding. The Gate Agent, who had not briefed the flight crew on any exemptions, initially denied knowing about one. Passenger X presented a boarding pass with an ink-written exemption and a letter stating his disability. Despite the Gate Agent's initial approval, the flight attendant insisted on consulting the Captain, who confirmed that an exemption was needed specifically for the flight. The Gate Agent then retrieved a record confirming the exemption, allowing Passenger X to remove the mask for short periods. However, during the 2.5-hour flight, Passenger X repeatedly ignored the mask policy, often only covering his chin instead of his nose and mouth. Compounding the issue, Passenger X's disruptive two-year-old child coughed and sneezed throughout the flight, and Passenger X cited anxiety as a reason for non-compliance. Despite the exemption, Passenger X showed total disregard for the mask rules, requiring multiple reminders from the flight crew. An exemption was granted for Passenger X to remove the mask for specified intervals. However, Passenger X failed to adhere to the exemption, leading to repeated reminders and non-compliance during the flight.",mask policy

During compliance; child is still not wearing a mask. FA offers a cookie trying to convince the child to wear a mask. Mother of child informs us she screams and cries when she wears it. Asked Customer Service lead to give a final warning to mother. Was a very uncomfortable situation as we witnessed the mother begin to pull out her phone. Mother was very upset.

They both seemed to be happy towards end of flight as we provided snack and beverages to ease the situation.I do not think we should enforce young children to wear masks. Child could possibly have disability and be unable to wear the mask. We are unaware of the family's situation and it is very hard to enforce grown adults to wear masks; let alone young children who don't understand what is going on.,,Passenger came onboard with X-year old child not wearing a mask. Gate agent tells me they were told to put it on and the child was screaming. I go to the back with a cookie and kindly ask if she can put her mask on and the mom tries to put it on and the child refuses. I asked if she is willing to sit in row XX so she wouldn't be near any of the other passengers. I moved passengers that were within 3 rows away from the mom and child. The mom looked stressed and her eyes were red. I know our policy is black and white regarding our process and removing a passenger. I felt like moving the passenger was the best thing to do; as I did not want this to turn into another public nightmare. I also asked if anybody felt uncomfortable with the small child taking the mask off at times while she is sitting far from everybody else and they all agreed it was OK. I told Captain the situation and they called a duty officer on their behalf to clear us to leave. The reason for making the exception made sense. She was at least 3 rows away from the nearest person; we avoided a meltdown; she was getting her camera ready and the bathroom in the back was inop so we knew nobody would go back there.

She confirmed her identity as well as confirmed that she was traveling as a non-revenue passenger.  I gave her the form and explained in great detail that failure to comply with the mask policy would likely result in severe disciplinary action. I explained that the policy is mandatory and that the Captain wanted me to inform her that failure to comply would result in the aircraft being met upon arrival in ZZZ1.  She had requested more alcohol to drink so I informed her that the Captain and I had made the decision to not serve her anymore alcohol since she was being belligerent.

I then informed her that I would pass along to the Captain how she responded.The FO exited the cockpit for a break shortly after my conversation with Passenger X.  FO also observed Passenger X sitting in seat XA without wearing her mask.  I once again contacted the cockpit and advised the Captain that Passenger X was still refusing to comply and that FO also witnessed her being non-compliant. Shortly after FO went on her break; I observed Passenger X put her mask on the right of her seat and pull the blanket up over her head.  She kept her head covered until we prepared the cabin for landing.  As we did final safety checks; I observed her remove the blanket from her head.  She was not wearing a mask the entire time she had her head under the blanket.Upon arrival in ZZZ1; the plane was met by two Customer Service Managers as well as In-flight Supervisor.

The flight attendant (Purser) made multiple announcements regarding the mask requirement during boarding and after takeoff. Despite these reminders, Passenger X was observed not wearing a mask on several occasions. The flight attendant approached her multiple times, including offering a clean mask, but Passenger X became confrontational, refused to comply, and used inappropriate language. The flight attendant informed the cockpit, and the captain threatened to have the aircraft met upon arrival. Passenger X eventually covered her head with a blanket but did not wear the mask. Upon landing, the plane was met by customer service managers and an in-flight supervisor, and the flight attendant identified Passenger X as she exited the aircraft.",mask policy

I was shocked at his response. I figured he was not going to give any support to the situation so I just turned and walked out of the flight deck. Another crew member told me that Mr. A gave him attitude also. At this point I felt that the Captain was not going to give us any support to the situation so I briefed the rest of the flight attendants to not address Mr. A. about wearing his mask so that we would not have a bad situation happen inflight.

Plus it looked like it was a weave similar to what we used to wear as kids to cover our mouths and neck in the Midwest winters. Not a tight weave at all. I looked up the policy. It didn't say much about weave; so I went and apologized to him; only to have my head bit off more.This walking; talking while holding a cup of coffee is not actively drinking.

The pilots initially refused to wear masks, citing active drinking as their reason, though the flight attendant argued that their actions did not constitute active drinking. The NR Pilot also wore a wrap that did not meet the required standards, leading the flight attendant to check the policy, which lacked specific details on weave. Despite her apology, the NR Pilot remained non-compliant. The DH Pilot complied with the mask policy only during takeoff, failing to cover his nose, and slumped during a walkthrough, making it unclear if he adhered to the policy. The NR Pilot delayed compliance until the aircraft was taxing. Both pilots used their activities as excuses, with the NR Pilot becoming upset when addressed by another crew member.

This happens many many times on each flight.   Merely making announcements doesn't seem to do the trick.  Serving does not feel safe for me as a result.  It may seem like a silly idea; but what about a role play with the two flight attendants after takeoff in front of cabin to demonstrate not to pull down mask?  Sort of like the safety demo; with a set script where the one pretends to pull down mask and the other says 'Please don't do that!'It's worth a try.

He pulled mask up.  I did another trash run and mask was lowered again.  I reminded him of policy.  Instead of pulling it up; he requested to see the policy in writing.  He then spoke with other FA and said he was being singled out because of his tattoos.   She told him she had seen me as I had reminded several others.

Another passenger, Passenger Y, supported Passenger X's claim, suggesting the flight attendant was targeting him unfairly. The flight attendant informed the captain, who made a cabin announcement about the mask policy.

She put the mask on after Flight Attendant B told her and she removed her mask after the wheels came up and it remained off while not eating or drinking during ascending phase. She then brought out a large bag of popcorn eating it one by one. When she was done with that she would take mini sips of her drink whenever we would walk by to give the appearance of constantly eating or drinking. Because 'briefly eating' leaves a window that is open for debate and we weren't sure what to do and felt because if she presented an attitude when boarding; it would cause a larger than life scene.

During the boarding process from ZZZ-ZZZ1; I noticed that a passenger in the jetway was not wearing a face covering. When she entered the aircraft; at the forward entry; I politely asked the passenger if she had a face covering or a mask and if so; I kindly asked her to put it on. She shook her head and said 'Whatever.' I politely informed her of policy concerning wearing a face covering throughout her journey and offered her a complimentary mask. She appeared to be searching for her personal mask in her purse and refused a complimentary mask and walked away.After the boarding process was totally complete; the Ops Agent confirmed with me that all of the passengers were onboard.I proceeded to make the All Passengers Onboard PA. Afterward; I closed a few forward overhead bins a concerned passenger informed me that when she went to the aft lavatory; the passenger who came onboard without a face covering had taken it off. I thanked the concerned passenger and reminded her that the mask can be briefly removed for eating or taking medicine and also; thanked her for bringing it to my attention.Because; it was bought to my attention. I proceeded to address the passenger who boarded without a face covering and noticed once again that she was not complying and was not wearing a face covering. I politely approached her and kindly asked her to comply with airline policy and to put on her mask. Before; I could say anything else she immediately interrupted me and her tone of voice became aggressive toward me. In her aggressive tone of voice; she said: 'What! You got a problem with me.' I said no ma'am and quietly walked away. Because; she was not wearing a mask and her tone of voice elevated and she became aggressive. I did not want any potential traveling droplets to make contact with my eyes. Therefore; I quietly walked away. At this point; we were still at the gate and I knew I only had a short window to have the non-complaint passenger addressed concerning her not wearing a face covering.Therefore; I went to inform the Captain but he was in the lavatory. Also; I knew the Ops Agent had confirmed with me that boarding was complete.

I am not sure what she told them or what they said to her; but she and someone traveling with her were escorted off the aircraft. After; they deplaned. The Ops Agent said goodbye and closed the door.   With the world-wide spread of the coronavirus that could potentially spread through respiratory droplets; from person-to-person. In my mind; I was thinking this is a precaution COVID concern for the health and safety of the wellbeing of every passenger and crew member onboard and the best time to address policy is before we pushed back or have to return back to the gate because of a non-compliant passenger who was not wearing a face covering. The Captain was in the lavatory; the boarding process was totally complete and confirmed by the Ops Agent that the last person had boarded the aircraft. I had made the All Passengers Onboard PA.

During boarding for the Passenger X was the last passenger to board. He came on with a mask in his hand. I was the A Flight Attendant (FA) and informed him of the mask requirement. I told him; 'The mask must be on for boarding and remain on the entire flight covering your nose and mouth.' He put his paper mask on and asked where his seat was since he couldn't remember. I looked up his seat number and it was XX4. After he sat down he took his mask off again according to the aft flight attendants. FA1 and FA2 both instructed him to put his mask on covering his nose and mouth. He complied when asked; but then removed it again during walk through before takeoff. FA1 came forward and told me about taking his mask off again. He said he lost his mask so she brought him a new one from our kit and he put it on. After takeoff during service he again had his mask off. The aft flight attendants again told him he must cover his nose and mouth.After discussing his non-compliance repeatedly with the COVID-19 mask policy we decided the next time he had it off we would issue a final warning. About an hour before landing in ZZZ a couple [of] passengers came forward to complain about a man not wearing his mask at all. I went back to talk to him and it was Passenger X in XX4 again. He was making those around him uncomfortable and they said he would take the mask off as soon at the flight attendants would walk away. I issued him a warning and explained to him that this was his final warning about not wearing his mask. He said he lost his mask again. I went and got him a new mask out of the flight attendant kit and explained again that it must cover his nose and mouth. I instructed him to read the policy and that if he violated the mask policy again he would be reported and banned from flying on our airline. He put on his new mask and acknowledged that he understood. During final descent as I was sitting in my jumpseat and Passenger X leaned in the aisle and removed his mask. During taxi to the gate he stood up and started walking. I got on the PA and said 'Please; remain in your seat with seatbelts fastened with masks covering nose and mouth.' He sat down but did not put his mask on. Passengers around him were shaking their heads.We didn't call to the gate for him to be met because we were almost there. When we reached the gate I informed the Customer Service Agent (CSA) about the situation. The CSA asked if we wanted the police; but we decided that since we were ready to deplane it wouldn't help. The Captain pointed Passenger X out as he was deplaning with no mask. He said that Passenger X was the same passenger that was an issue on his previous flight for not wearing a mask.  As Passenger X passed me during deplaning I explained that since he was not compliant to COVID-19 policies and our mask mandate he was getting reported as I warned he would during the flight.

I went to first class to talk to the A FA and she was talking to the passenger in X6. She asked the man how old his child was; he said 2 years and X months old. FA A informed him the child is required to wear a mask. The man then said the child was under 2.  The issue now was the child under 2 was seated in [his own seat]. (The father had purchased a seat for the child); I recommended that we just move the father and child to the row behind them. The couple seated in Y 1 and 3 were the grandparents so the father and child switched seats with them.I returned to the aft of the aircraft. I was later informed by FA A that the agents told her the child was over 2 years old. Throughout the flight I was in the first class cabin and the child never had a mask on. ALSO!! When I was doing my demo the grandmother who was seated in X6 did not have her nose covered. I asked her very kindly to cover her nose and she rolled her eyes and gave a big huff but did cover her nose. I was called to guard the flight deck door and she once again did not have her nose covered. I explained that she needed to cover her nose; once again she objected but complied. Only the First Officer (FO) used the lavatory and in that short time I had to ask her at least 4 times to cover her nose. She was so rude and resistant. I finally told her that I wouldn't stand guard if she didn't keep her mask on. The FO came out of the lavatory; I explained to the FO what was going on; the woman saw me talking to the FO and put her mask over her nose. FA A finally gave the father a warning. Other than the mom and Grandpa this family was seldom; the 2 year old Child never did wear a mask; in compliance with our Mask policy.   The child was 2 years that is why the father purchased a seat. Both parents lied about the age of the child when they found out the child was required to wear a mask. Which then required us to move the child from X4.,,There's a family of four adults (parents and grandparents); a 2 year old and a baby. The 2 year old did not have his face mask on during boarding. I asked the father how old the child was. He said two and two months; I said that he had to have a mask on since he [was] over two.At that time the father said that his son was under two years old. The father grabbed his son and put him on his lap. His son was wiggling and fussing on his lap and finally he fell on the floor and screamed because of pain. He calmed down quickly; and still was sitting on dad's lap. (Later; during the flight the parents found a bleeding scratch on their son's back head and asked for First Aid antiseptic wipes.)The son looked like he was over 2 years old.  I asked the father what was the exact age of his son. He said that [he was] under Two. I had to call CSA and asked her to find out the exact age of the child. She found out that the child was over two years old. At that time I told the father that his son was not an infant; and he had to take his own seat and wear his face mask. The whole family were not happy with that; all the family members claimed the child was under two years old. Mother worried that they had purchased a seat for him and her son had to be on dad's lap. The father attempted to put a face mask on his son and he said that he would do his best to keep a face mask on during the flight. The family swapped seats.CSA came on board and asked if I wanted to remove the child from the flight. The father confirmed he would take all possible attempts to keep a face mask on his son. My decision was to keep the family on board.After 10;000 feet when I was taking the orders I saw that the boy did not have a mask on. I started talking to the father and he became not cooperative and talked to me in a rude manner. He said that his son was drinking water. I reminded him that the mask must be on when not actively eating or drinking. The father responded to me that I had to stay away from them; keep social distance (I did!); do not ask them any questions and do not offer them anything. At that time he actually was trying to make his son drink the water from the bottle in front of me. During the flight I was monitoring the child's compliance. He was watching his iPad and was not wearing a mask. I gave a warning to the father.During the rest of the flight the boy was not compliant. Parents put a bag of crackers in front of him to pretend he was actively eating.During the flight; with no mask on; they went to the lavatory in the aft (the forward lavatory was not operable). When they were coming back from the lavatory through the main cabin I was picking up trash and showed the father with my hands that mask must be on the child. The father ignored my request and just told me not to touch them. I talked to the Captain; explained the situation with the family who were not compliant and tried to hide the age of their child; and asked for a CSA to meet the flight in ZZZ. During demo and at cruising FA B had to ask grandmother to cover her nose many times. The grandmother was rolling her eyes when asked to cover her nose before we could let the pilots take a break. CSA met the flight in ZZZ and I reported the fact of hiding the child's age and the compliance issue to her.,,Flight Attendant crew reported a family did not comply with face mask policy.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (FA B) and a family traveling on a flight. The family included a 2-year-old child who was seated in his own seat but did not wear a face mask, despite the airline's policy requiring masks for children over 2 years old. The father initially claimed the child was under 2 years old, but it was later discovered that the child was over 2 years old. This led to a disagreement over the child's seating and mask compliance. FA B attempted to resolve the issue by suggesting a seat change, but the family was resistant. The father claimed the child was under 2 years old, even after being informed that the child was over 2. The family eventually swapped seats with the grandparents, but the child continued to refuse to wear a mask during the flight. The flight attendant repeatedly warned the father about the mask policy and reported the family's non-compliance to the cabin service assistant (CSA) and the captain. Additionally, the grandmother in the family repeatedly failed to comply with the mask policy, despite being reminded multiple times by the flight attendant. The family's non-compliance with the mask policy and their attempt to hide the child's age created a challenging situation for the flight attendant, who ultimately decided to allow the family to remain on the flight but reported the incident to the CSA upon landing. The incident highlights the challenges faced by flight attendants in enforcing mask policies and the need for passengers to adhere to safety regulations.",mask policy

He replied that he did not have one. I began to feel very uncomfortable as he was having trouble keeping his distance while also not having a face covering on. I told him if you can go get your face covering at your seat; we'd all really appreciate it and I'll get your waters and snacks ready in the meantime. He said again he did not have one. I told him that we will provide one for you no problem. So I had Flight Attendant (FA) A go and grab one for him and he slowly and reluctantly put it on. He started saying that it doesn't make sense that he was allowed to board without one. I specifically recalled him wearing one before and during taxiing out.He stood in the back galley and was now complying with wearing the mask and I gave him some waters and snacks. He asked for my name and badge number to file a complaint. I told him that this isn't anything personal or something to argue about; it's just our company's policy to wear a face covering and it's something that not only makes me feel comfortable but all the people around you. I also gave him my first name and the flight number. He started to tell me in an argumentative way that it is how I said for him to put his face mask on that was rude especially with asking him to take a step back when he wasn't wearing one at all. I told him that I had nicely asked him and now you're wearing one that we provided; thanks. He explained further that he thinks that I'm 'one of those people on the left.' I simply explained to him that I don't want to argue about this as this is simply just a policy that everyone on board must comply with; that's it! He tried to keep arguing with me and I replied that I'm not here to argue about this; or what I was asking you to do; I'm just grateful that you're now wearing your mask; so thank you.

The attendant had another crew member fetch a mask, which the passenger reluctantly put on. The passenger then argued that the request was rude and claimed he wasn't wearing a mask during boarding, despite the attendant's recollection of him doing so.

I also ask the flight deck to make an announcement regarding face masks and to ensure coverage of both nose and mouth is included so that we are all unified. All gate agent pre-boarding announcements and Flight Attendant announcements should be updated to specify that passengers must cover their nose and mouths throughout the full duration of flight unless actively eating or drinking.Passenger X (X1) was the last passenger to board.

She mentioned that she reminded this passenger regarding mask compliance at the gate; however I was unaware until I saw her in passing between flights. I reminded this passenger to comply with his mask during boarding. Once the boarding door was closed the AFT FA asked the passenger to turn his phone on airplane mode and to disconnect his call. He complied until she walked passed and got directly back on the phone all through our safety demonstration. The non-revenue FA that sat in row X in front of the passenger rang the FA call button before I took my jumpseat to discreetly inform me that he was still on his cell phone.

After boarding was almost done; Flight Attendant (FA) D advised me that the child in row X is not wearing a mask.  I walked to their row and asked the parents if the child had a mask or would they like one of ours.  Both parents quickly stated; 'He's 2 and he won't wear a mask.  Good luck if you want to try.'  'We were told 2 is okay for no mask.'  'He won't wear a mask.'I decided to disengage and have the Customer Service Agent (CSA) contacted. I advised them that a CSA would be down to have a conversation with them. The Captain was advised and I asked for a CSA to come down to the aircraft. The boarding agent talked to the party and advised me that the parents were attempting to put a mask on the child.A second CSA came down and asked me about the age and our mask policy. She advised me they had a conversation with the party prior to boarding and wrongly advised the parents of the age requirement for wearing a mask. I advised the CSA it clearly states on policy that age 2 and up must wear a mask; no exceptions. The ZZZ Station needs to retrain or re-examine the Mask Policy because it is very clear on all guest facing touch points that our policy is stated age 2 and up. Our ZZZ Station CSA's are advising guests incorrect age requirements for our mask policy. I advised both CSA's that due to the statements made by the parents that their child would not wear a mask that the FA crew wanted them removed from the flight.As the family deplaned they yelled and blamed me for getting them kicked off this flight. I apologized but I reiterated our mask policy as they were deplaning.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a family with child were removed from the flight because of non-compliance regarding face mask policy. The family was incorrectly told by station agents; a mask was not required for the 2 year old.,"A conflict arose during a flight when a family with a 2-year-old child boarded without the child wearing a face mask. The flight attendant (FA) identified the issue and approached the parents, who refused to comply with the face mask policy, citing incorrect prior information from station agents that a 2-year-old does not need a mask. The FA escalated the matter by contacting a Customer Service Agent (CSA), who confirmed the parents' claim. However, the FA emphasized that the airline's policy clearly states that children aged 2 and older must wear masks, with no exceptions. The FA requested the family be removed from the flight due to their non-compliance. The family was eventually asked to deplane, blaming the FA for their removal. The FA apologized and reiterated the mask policy. The incident highlighted a potential need for retraining or re-examining the mask policy communication at the ZZZ Station, as the CSA had incorrectly advised the parents about the age requirement.",mask policy

My A FA; upon doing her final walk through for takeoff had to tell passenger seated XX2 to stow her bag back under the seat in front of her. Passenger in doing so FA A noticed she was wearing a small boot on her left foot. FA A informed the pilots we had to re-seat passenger. Pilots pulled over; passenger was reseated and we went on our way.I do not know the exact time of day this happened; but was told we arrived 5 minutes late. But it says differently on our payroll sheet which says we arrived early. With that being said; we had a few mask situations during descent; one passenger complaining another wasn't wearing her mask; both passenger were through passenger. Announcements were made; 2 of the 4 FAs spoke to the unmasked passenger. During cleaning of aircraft a passenger informed me of the passenger not wearing her mask. I spoke to the unmasked passenger explaining why she had to wear a mask; but we ended up requesting either Operations or a Supervisor to speak to unmasked passenger because she told me the old lady needs to mind her own business.

During the flight, the FA noticed a passenger wearing a small boot on her left foot, which required the passenger to be reseated. This led to a slight delay, though there was a discrepancy in the reported arrival time. During descent, two passengers were observed not wearing their masks, and the FA made announcements to address the issue. Two FAs spoke to the unmasked passengers, and an operations agent resolved the situation by speaking to the unmasked passenger, who then complied and moved seats. Upon boarding, another passenger tried to sit in an Over Wing Window Exit (OWWE) using a seatbelt extension, and passengers were observed letting their masks slip below their noses. One passenger removed her mask while on a call, but the FA intervened, and the passenger complied. The FAs conducted heavy mask patrols throughout the flight to ensure compliance.

The flight attendant reported that passengers blatantly refused to comply with the mask-wearing requirement, which mandates masks to be worn at all times, even while sleeping, except when actively eating or drinking. Many passengers either did not wear masks at all, only covered their mouths, or removed their masks as soon as the flight attendant was out of sight. Despite the flight attendant's efforts to enforce the policy, the passengers displayed non-compliant behavior, including rolling their eyes and pretending to follow instructions. The flight attendant expressed concern over the lack of adherence, emphasizing the importance of mask-wearing for safety and the need for strict enforcement, as other airlines consistently enforce such policies.

Flight Attendant B asked her to put the mask on and the passenger said she can't talk on the phone through a mask. Flight Attendant B insisted and the woman begrudgingly put the mask on. As I passed by the passenger she was again not wearing the mask and speaking on her phone. I stood by the seat in front of her waiting for a good break in the conversation for a time to talk with her and she wrapped up the conversation and said sorry and put the phone away. I told her it wasn't an issue with the phone; but the health and safety of those around her. She put her mask on. Shortly thereafter as we were preparing the cabin for departure I noticed her mask was below her nose. She was wearing her headphones and did not hear me; but when she saw me she pulled the mask up over her nose. Based on the attitude she gave Flight Attendant B and the fact that the mask was off again when I came by; and then not properly worn a third time Flight Attendant B and I concurred that if we had to speak with her again it would merit a disciplinary action. We also told the flight deck this; so that they would be aware. Throughout the flight we did have close eyes on her; as one does when a passenger has already exhibited behavior that is against the rules; but I tried not to hound on her. During service I saw her and some others wearing their mask below their nose or off in the long times between sips and I made a PA asking everyone to be compliant (in no way singling her out).Once it came time for final compliance for landing I came back through and again her mask was fully below her nose. I stopped and kneeled down and told her that we had already spoken with her about the mask and that wearing it under the nose does not comply. During the conversation that followed she did not pull her mask over her nose until after I had walked away.She told me that she has a medical condition that makes her light headed and that she has been doing her best with the mask. I told her that while for several months we had mask exemptions for medical cases for the last month it has been mandatory regardless of individual. She asked me for my full name and asked if she could take a picture of my name tag. I told her I was not comfortable giving my last name but if she reached out to the company they would know who I was. She said that I was rude for hounding her and briefly said the word 'Nazi' in reference to my strict adherence to the mask policy and 'targeting' of her.The specifics of timing between what was said during this conversation and what was said in the conversation after I brought disciplinary action and later during final compliance all kind of meld; but these things were said.She said that it was wrong to single out people who have medical conditions and that they don't have to share what the condition is. I reminded her that at no point did I ask her what her condition is and that she only shared that she had a condition at the end of the flight after things came to a head. I also explained again that regardless of condition the mask policy is for anyone who wants to fly.Some guests in the nearby rows thanked me for sticking to the policy as they had had concerns with the passenger in question not wearing her mask throughout the flight. I did my best to thank them for their support; but also to not rile up the non-compliant passenger nor the woman across the aisle who seemed to have befriended and come to the passenger's side (however this woman never spoke up to me or in my earshot). I did not want to put passengers against each other or cause more disruption.Passenger also said that she was not planning on flying [Airline] ever again. We let the Captain know [of the situation] and he called ahead to have a Supervisor meet passenger. During deplaning several of the other passengers that were in surrounding seats and had spoken up again thanked me for the way I handled the situation and said they'd be writing in to the company.,,Passenger was sitting in seat XX1. When securing the cabin before door closure she was on phone and had mask looped on one ear and hanging down and I asked her to put it on she said 'but I can't talk on the phone with it' and I said 'I apologize but it has to be worn over your nose and mouth at all times it is our policy' then she just looked at me with an attitude and then I asked her again if she could please put it on to which she said 'sssuurrreeee' and put it on. Then I informed another FA and told him to keep an eye on her and then he immediately walked through the cabin and she had it off again; not even one minute later. So he also asked her to put it on. After safety demo passenger had mask on but not covering her nose FA A asked her to pull it up and make sure it is covering both her nose and mouth.Inflight there were times she took exaggerated time to eat and drink. As were others in the cabin so we made a PA; (overall I bet we made 20 mask policy PAs during the entire flight).Then during descent FA A observed her with it off again. I seen him having a conversation with her so I approached and he mentioned to her the policy and the reasons and the procedure and then told her he would be back.He said she said she knows the policy. And around that time she mentioned to him that she was trying her best but she has a medical condition. She continued to argue with him and ask for his name to file a complaint. Passengers in front of and behind her gave thanks to FA A for enforcing the policy and said he handled it well. I do believe she overheard them praising him. We notified Captain and he informed [the] arrival station.,,Flight attendants reported a passenger did not comply with face mask policy during flight.,"The incident involved a passenger who repeatedly failed to comply with the face mask policy during a flight. Flight attendants initially approached the passenger, who argued about her inability to talk on the phone with the mask on. Despite reminders and policy explanations, the passenger continued to remove her mask, citing a medical condition. The attendants, following company protocols, persisted in their requests, leading to a confrontational exchange where the passenger used derogatory language. The situation was reported to the captain, who arranged for a supervisor to meet the passenger upon landing. The passenger expressed her intention not to fly with the airline again, while other passengers commended the attendants' adherence to safety regulations.

I noticed him walk on with the gate agent who was asking him to put his mask back on. The gate agent then told me that they had been trying to get him on a flight for 3 days. I asked more about this; feeling a little concerned as to what could have caused them to deny him boarding these previous days and if it could be an issue during the flight. They told me the previous days he had not wanted to board the plane. He had explained to them that he hadn't gotten sleep and also hadn't eaten. I'm not sure what happened those past few days but it was communicated that he had gotten enough sleep and was able to finally board the plane.I made sure to ask clearly if they thought there might be any issue during the flight or if there was anything I should know that could cause an issue in-flight. The agent I talked to said she thought he was harmless.During boarding a woman nearby asked if he was going to wear his mask. I looked over and he had it down at his chin. I asked him to put it on and he did. This was an ongoing issue during the flight - he kept taking it off and we had to keep asking/reminding him to put it on.While taxiing to takeoff he got up out of his seat and moved a few rows back. I alerted the Captain but by this time he was already seated back down. We took off. I had him move back to sit in his original seat and he seemed fine the rest of the flight.   Right before takeoff while we were still taxiing; [he] got up out of his seat and moved back a few rows to the exit row. I called the Captain and let him know someone was out of his seat. By this time [he] was seated a few rows back. The pilot made an announcement that everyone needed to be in their seat and then we took off. We just continued with taking off when we were scheduled. The thing is; [he] was now seated in an exit row for takeoff and he had not been briefed to sit there. I also doubted his ability to perform the necessary exit row duties. Once we were up in the air I did go back and confirmed that [he] was now seated in an exit row. I had him move back to his original row where he stayed for the duration of the flight. The only other issues we had was that when I would walk by he wasn't always wearing his mask. I would remind him and he would put it on. He seemed not to be intentionally doing it but perhaps just not mentally 'all there.'More communication from CSA to CSA. When we arrived in ZZZ1 I alerted the gate agent that we had a meet and assist and the D FA pointed him out to the gate agent as he deplaned. I don't think the extent of the situation had been communicated. Then again it's not our job to babysit people. Maybe his family should have been contacted and asked to fly with him? He seemed unfit to fly on his own.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger kept switching seats and did not comply with face mask policy during flight.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and a passenger (Party2) on a flight.

The flight attendant noted his non-compliance with the face mask policy, requiring multiple reminders. Additionally, the passenger moved seats twice: first to the exit row during taxiing and again after takeoff, where he remained without proper briefing. The flight attendant had to intervene each time, successfully moving him back. The passenger also seemed mentally fatigued, often removing his mask unintentionally.

The Customer Service Agent (CSA) was by the boarding door; and the A informed her on what was going on and the CSA automatically knew who we were talking about. She already had a discussion with this guest about wearing a mask on the plane. He put it on in front of her; but took it off before he got on the plane. We decided that a Supervisor needed to have a talk with him. The A FA informed the Captain on the situation and he went to the back of the cabin; and noticed that this guest was still not wearing a mask.A CSA Supervisor; came onto the plane and removed the guest who was non-compliant with the company's face mask policy.,,Passenger in XX4 boarded the aircraft last; with no mask. I was making a PA while the FA D had just started closing bins etc. I noticed he was not wearing a mask after he passed me. D FA asked him to put a mask on and if he needed one. He said he had one. She asked him to put it on and thanked him. He stowed his bag and she again asked kindly to please make sure your mask is on. He did not. The FA walked away. After waiting approximately 5 minutes and no compliance I; the A FA walked backed back to his seat bringing extra masks. I tried to hand him one. He said I have one. And I said; please put it on. He then said sternly and harshly; I heard you the first time.  I walked way. He did not put a mask on. Our Captain walked by to introduce himself to the FAs in the back; the passenger still did not comply.  I asked the agent about him. She said; yes I had to tell him to put it on in order to board.  He complied; so I let him board. He obviously took it off after passing her. He was asked 4 times to comply. I decided giving him a warning before we closed the door was only going to escalate the situation.  We decided to ask the agent to deplane him. As he deplaned with agent he still did not have a mask on nor was he trying to put one on. The crew did not feel comfortable with him going with us.,,Air Carrier flight attendants reported a passenger would not comply with face mask policy and was removed from the flight.,"The incident occurred during boarding when a flight attendant noticed a passenger without a face mask. The passenger was asked multiple times to comply with the face mask policy but refused. The flight attendant informed the captain, who also attempted to address the situation, but the passenger remained non-compliant. After several attempts to resolve the issue, a supervisor and a customer service agent intervened, leading to the passenger being removed from the flight before takeoff. The crew deemed it necessary for safety and policy adherence, resulting in the passenger's deplanement.",mask policy

Passenger X's face was covered with a hoodie. I asked Passenger X to put a mask on and the reply was 'no I will not.' Passenger X was going to use the hoodie because it was a barrier. Passenger X started to shout at me and continued to tell me the hoodie would stay on. Passenger X started to go on about how a mask doesn't protect anyone; so at that point I said I would be back right back. Because he wanted to escalate the situation I went up to tell the A Flight Attendant; she came back and explained to Passenger X the company's policy. Passenger X's wife [also] added that the mask doesn't protect anyone.

The attendant requested compliance with the mask policy, but Passenger X refused, stating the hoodie would serve as a sufficient barrier. He became aggressive, shouting and arguing that masks are ineffective. The attendant left but returned with another attendant, who explained the policy.

I was in the front galley when he came forward because I had finished securing the cabin. The operations Agent and Supervisor left the aircraft; and the passenger was standing in the front galley. He was visibly frustrated on the event and started venting. This was in total public view of all other passengers on board. To help diffuse the situation; and spare the passenger from embarrassment; and to provide more of a private setting; I stepped off the aircraft with him; and stood at the bottom of the jetway with him while he vented to me. This was happening a few minutes before scheduled push time. I waited at the bottom of the jetway with the passenger for quite some time; expecting the operations Agent or Supervisor to come down; and I could direct him to them to answer questions he had. After several minutes; no one came to the plane; I made an executive decision to assist the passenger; told [Flight Attendant] A I was going to walk him to the top; and that I would be right back; since no agent was coming down. I walked him to the top of the jetway; where he was able to be properly assisted. I immediately walked back to the plane where a couple of minutes later we closed the door and pushed the flight as normal. Since the passenger was left at the plane; and there were no ground personnel to assist us (the Supervisor and operations Agent were there; then left); I made the executive decision to deplane. I believe I made the right decision in the moment given the situation. I do not know why the Supervisor didn't stay there with the passenger to assist him. I realize fully we all have a job to do; and cannot speak for why the Supervisor and operations agent left the passenger at the plane; and did not walk him up the jetway. I am not putting blame on anyone; I am simply writing an observation. Ultimately; it was me who made the decision to deplane.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that after boarding the aircraft they exited with a passenger who did not comply with face mask policy.,"The incident began when a passenger failed to comply with the face mask policy, prompting their removal from the aircraft. The Flight Attendant, having completed cabin checks, encountered the passenger in the front galley, who was visibly upset and confrontational, attracting attention from other passengers. To de-escalate, the Flight Attendant escorted the passenger off the plane, where they waited for ground personnel. However, when the Supervisor and operations agent did not return, the Flight Attendant, recognizing the need for timely action, decided to walk the passenger to the jetway's top to assist him further. This action allowed the flight to proceed normally, with the door closing and departure as scheduled. The Flight Attendant's decision to assist the passenger herself resolved the situation, highlighting her proactive approach in the absence of ground staff.",mask policy

I immediately returned to the back and passenger XXA had the mask pulled back down to his neck.  I did exactly the same thing again; very politely; I stated; 'Hey; you have to wear your mask.' He looked at me and said; 'Shut up.'  I responded; sorry; what did you say?  He removed the mask and yelled very loudly; 'SHUT UP!' and that's what I did and walked away.

I just said OK.  I proceeded back to the front of the aircraft and when I looked at him; the mask was back down around his neck.  I informed the Captain.  Honestly; I felt like if this man is bold enough to scream 'SHUT UP' at me in the cabin; there is no limits.  I was too afraid to say anything else to him.  He continued the flight without a mask.  I discussed this with the Captain.  The crew and I agreed he would become belligerent.  We informed the Captain of such.

Passengers were complaining about him not wearing a mask.He does not need to fly if he cannot comply.  Also; the CSA in ZZZ did not inform us/me of his previous behavior.

However; during the flight; almost all of the many children would not wear their masks. Many of the adults wore their masks under their nose or not at all.

I also stocked the cockpit with a 6 pack of water and continued to do my security checks. C Flight Attendant arrived a little later and we chatted catching up since we last worked together. Shortly thereafter; B Flight Attendant arrived. B Flight Attendant and I started chatting and catching up since we had not worked together since 2019. Toward the end of B Flight Attendant and my conversation with C Flight Attendant present; I stated; 'These are crazy times since COVID. C Flight Attendant and I have recently worked together. So that we can better protect each other and social distance as much as possible; B Flight Attendant and I can do the water service. You (B Flight Attendant) can serve from the back and I can serve from the front and that we can meet somewhere in the middle of the cabin. C Flight Attendant can pass out the snacks. We all can take turns making trash runs individually. You and I can also pass out the paperwork the same way. You can distribute paperwork starting from the back of the cabin and I will start from the front of the cabin and we will meet somewhere in the middle of the cabin.' We all agreed.C Flight Attendant and B Flight Attendant continued to chat and I continued setting up and arranging my workspace in the forward galley.  As I was kneeling checking my compartment in the forward bulkhead; the First Officer walked onto the aircraft.  As he was making his greeting of 'Hello; I'm FO [name];' I responded 'Hello; I'm (A Flight Attendant)' as I raised up to greet him. As I stood up; [the] FO and I were face to face and I was startled that he was not wearing a mask. I immediately asked while stepping back creating social distance; 'Where's your mask?' FO responded; 'Where's my mask?' I repeated; 'Yes; where is your mask. We all need to wear our mask to help prevent the spread of the Coronavirus and to keep each other and their families safe.' [The] FO reached into his pocket and pulled his face mask out of it. He then rolled his bags into the cockpit with his mask in his hand. I then pushed up the cockpit door as I completed my rev napkin and completed the security document.Shortly after [the] FO got settled in the cockpit; he came out back into the cabin; but wearing his mask this time. He then said; 'Do you feel safer now that I am wearing the mask?' I responded; 'Absolutely. Thank You.' He then walked further into the cabin where C Flight Attendant and B Flight Attendant were standing between the bulkhead and row X talking. [The] FO was standing with his back against the bulkhead on the Captain side of the cabin/leaning into the aisle and B Flight Attendant was in the center of the aisle between row 1 and 2; C Flight Attendant was standing in front of row X in front of the bulkhead leaning toward the aisle. The Operations agent came and informed me of the specials and that boarding would be starting [soon]. I then went to retrieve gloves from the bulkhead compartment when I noticed that B Flight Attendant was no longer wearing her mask. She had her mask in her right hand. FO did not have his mask on properly. FO's mask was dangling by one strap on his right ear hanging down the right side of his face. Both of their noses and mouths were completely exposed as they were engaging in conversations. I then stated; 'Guys; we are about to start boarding and we are crew and it is very important that we all wear our masks over our nose and mouths while we are on the aircraft for our safety as well as the passengers who will be here shortly.' B Flight Attendant just stared at me. No one attempted to put their masks on immediately. I then repeated; 'Can I have both of you put your masks on to help the efforts of reducing the spread of COVID?' B Flight Attendant rolled her eyes at me and put her mask on covering her nose and mouth and started to walk down the aisle. FO then put on his maskand started walking back the main entrance area where I was standing.I then initiated the high-low chime to initiate that boarding would be starting shortly. FO says; as he is looking in the mirror adjusting his mask; 'Does this thing make you feel safer?' I said; 'Definitely. The masks when worn properly and with social distancing and good hand hygiene slows the spread of COVID.' FO says sarcastically; 'What is COVID?' I responded;' Everyone in the U.S. knows what COVID is since we have been dealing with it since March/April.' FO says; 'Well; I have never heard of it.' I said; 'It is a worldwide Pandemic therefore; you and everyone else has heard of it and knows exactly what it is for certain. The CDC; NIH; WHO; and the company have set guidelines stating that we all must wear mask on the planes. This should be second nature for all of us since most states have a mask mandate for public places since March/April.' We started boarding. The Captain came on the aircraft. He introduced himself and asked how things were going. I said; 'Hi! I'm (A Flight Attendant). Everything is okay except; the FO came on the aircraft without a mask and he was condescending; sarcastic; responding to me. He said; 'I wasn't here for that. I'm sorry that happened.  With the exception to the mask situation is everything okay. I said; 'Yes.' He gave me the pre-flight briefing to pass to the other Flight Attendants. He went into the cockpit. Boarding continued.In between the lag in the boarding process; B Flight Attendant comes up front from her boarding position in the back. She then opens the cockpit door (that I have pushed up as a protection since the pilots are not masked on the flight deck) and enters the cockpit and closed the door behind her. I continued to stay in my boarding position and continued the boarding process.  After about 5-7 minutes B Flight Attendant came out of the cockpit and went back to her boarding position. We continued the boarding process. I had completed the Opening PA and secured the cabin. (C Flight Attendant) came up front to tell me that the overwing was briefed. Captain then comes out of the cockpit and asked C-FA and I if everything was okay. C-FA and I responded; 'Yes.'Captain then went the back galley and talked to (B Flight Attendant) for a few minutes. During this time; I started to feel that the conversations that (B Flight Attendant) had when she entered the cockpit and their current conversation; I am the subject of discussion. So; when the Captain came back to the front of the plane I motioned for him to join me in the jetbridge to give him my version of events of (B Flight Attendant) and FO being annoyed with me for asking them to wear their masks on the plane. Since the passengers were on the plane; Captain and I stepped into the jetbridge. I told the Captain that I had asked (B Flight Attendant) and FO to put on their mask in effort to prevent or slow the spread of COVID. I told him that B Flight Attendant rolled her eyes at me and FO responded very sarcastically and condescendingly antagonizing me with a lengthy conversation regarding the mask. I did not ask anything of them outside of established protocols and guidelines established by the company; the State; and the CDC. The masks are a necessary piece of PPE that is necessary to prevent or slow the spread of COVID.'The Captain then said; 'I just need to know if you are going to be comfortable working with your crew on the plane.' I was startled and confused. I said. 'I'm sorry; I am not understanding your line of questioning.' He said; 'I don't know if you are comfortable working in a small space that is not going to give you 6 feet of space between you and your crew.' I said; 'I am talking to you about the mask policy and you are talking about social distancing. Then it dawned on me that B Flight Attendant must have said something to him about our social distancing conversation. He then repeated; 'I don't know if you are comfortable working in a small space that is not going to give you 6 feet of space between you and your crew.' I then said; 'WHOA; don't put words in my mouth. I never said anything about 6 feet of distancing to you or anyone else. There is ABSOLUTELY no way you can do our jobs with 6 feet of separation that is absurd and totally unrealistic. The passengers with the middle empty seat doesn't even have 6 feet between them. The C Flight Attendant sitting on row X is not 6 feet from the X jumpseat. When you briefed me earlier you were far less than 6 feet from me and I had no issues with distance. At this very moment that we are talking you are far less than 6 feet from me and I am fine; therefore; I think you know the answer to your question. If you need me to verbally say it; then I am fine being less than 6 feet from my crew and passengers.' He then said; 'With everything that you have on it is hard to believe that.' I said; 'I am wearing my mask and gloves which the company has approved as acceptable PPE for COVID when working; therefore I do not understand why it's concerning to you as an indication that I am uncomfortable being less than 6 feet from the passengers and my crew. We all should be using reasonable social distancing; PPE; and best hygiene practices collectively to prevent or slow the spread of COVID. I am just asking that protocol is being followed regarding my crew and passengers wearing face masks.'He then asked; 'Well is it protocol to close the cockpit door during boarding? I said; 'I never closed the door. The door was ajar with the latch/lock extended to prevent closing because you all (Captain and FO) did not have on mask on the flight deck and I had to remain in my boarding position that would put me in grave risk of potential COVID exposure or contracting COVID. My masks and PPE that I am wearing protects you and your family. If you and FO are in the cockpit without mask; there is nothing to protect me and my family since I must stand there for 30 minutes or longer. I used the ajar door as a protective shield for me from a potential COVID infection.' He said; 'You did not ask me.' I said; 'Sir; we obviously are having miscommunication; because you did not tell me that it bothered you.' He said; 'We do not have to wear masks when we are in the cockpit and when you close the door I can't hear the FO do the checks.' I said; 'That's a first. Most of the pilots close to door to hear better in the cockpit; but if you don't want the door ajar; then I won't do that. Will you at least wear the mask when the cockpit door is open to help protect me and my family from potentially contracting COVID since a lot of us may be asymptomatic spreaders?' He said; 'So you are asking us to wear a mask in the flight deck even though that is not our protocol?' I said; 'Sir; I am wearing my PPE and the passengers are wearing their PPE to protect others including you; therefore; I am asking you to wear PPE anytime you are on the plane where COVID could be potentially spread to me and others.' He said; 'Let me get this right. You want us to wear mask in the cockpit even though that is not our protocol.' I said; 'Sir; I am asking you to reciprocate the protections that I am affording you and your family by wearing my PPE properly. I am just asking for you to wear the mask to protect me and my family. How is it that we require passengers to do what we as crew are not willing to do? I have to stand in my boarding position which would be gross negligence since I would be in the path of a potential COVID exposure with no protections if you and the FO do not wear the mask with the door open. No problem. I am not willing to expose myself and my family to that level of risk. That level of consequence should not be required or expected of me while doing my job. I will have to just stand on the outside of the aircraft in front of the entrance and greet the passengers who will be wearing masks during boarding and deplaning.'He then asked; 'If,,,,Flight Attendant reported having a disagreement with the Captain and First Officer regarding their compliance with wearing face masks.,"The incident occurred when Flight Attendant A encountered non-compliance with mask policies and sarcastic remarks from the First Officer (FO) regarding COVID protocols. A addressed the FO's lack of a mask and emphasized the importance of masks as PPE. During boarding, A noticed both the FO and another flight attendant, B, were not wearing their masks properly and requested they comply. The FO made sarcastic comments about COVID, leading to a confrontation. A later discussed her concerns with the Captain, who expressed worries about her comfort working with the crew. A explained that social distancing was impractical and stressed the need for masks to protect everyone.

I told him since he was in the bulkhead he'd have to stow his bags above him in the overhead bin. He is now moving around; bending down close to the gentleman beside him; who clearly looked uncomfortable. I then handed him a mask and told him he needed to put it on. He said once again; he has one. My B-FA then comes up and I inform him of the situation. B FA says to the gentleman he needs to put his mask on and the man loudly and rudely says; 'Oh would you just shut your mouth!!'

The flight attendant repeatedly requested the passenger to wear their mask properly, making four passenger announcements and having the pilots make an additional announcement. Despite these efforts, the passenger removed their mask entirely once airborne. The flight attendant observed that the extensive food service provided during the flight made it difficult to enforce the mask policy, as the passenger frequently ate and removed their mask. The attendant was unable to issue warnings due to the passenger's consistent eating behavior. The passenger did not comply until the flight was cleaning up at 10,000 feet.

I was in the back; waiting for the aisle to clear so I could close the overhead bins and brief exit rows. I noticed the customer was in the galley speaking with the forward FA. I wasn't sure what her seat was; so I waited for her to go to her seat before I started walking forward and closing the bins. She grabbed her bag from row X and then sat in XYA; the exit row. I just assumed that was her assigned seat at the time. I closed the bins all the way to the front. I noticed a pilot commuting in row Z who had his mask around his chin and wasn't eating. I requested he put his mask back up and he did. The man behind him in X4 had his mask completely off; so I asked him to put it on and he did. When I asked that guy to put his on; another customer across also pulled theirs up; so I didn't have to ask that third person. I don't recall where the third person was sitting; I only remember they sat in [the area] on the left side of the aircraft. They put their mask up before I asked; so I didn't think much of that.I was quite annoyed that I had to remind so many customers to put their masks up. I briefed the exits like normal. After the door was closed and I did my compliance checks; other flight attendant motioned me toward her before the safety demo. She said that the woman who moved to the exit row was originally seated in [in a different area]; and that many customers had their masks off in that area; so she requested to move else where; and that's why she moved. I told other Flight Attendant that I did notice a lot more than usual with their masks off or down; especially in those first few rows of [that area]. Especially the [commuting] pilot and the guy behind him. Other flight attendant said the woman said something about a crew member not wearing a mask. There were a few flight attendants commuting; too; but they all had their masks on that I knew of. Later; inflight I spoke to the woman who moved; and I apologized and told her that it was not okay that they weren't wearing their masks; and that I did tell them to put them on and they did. She said she was especially appalled that a pilot wasn't wearing one; and said she was traveling to see a family member and was stressed enough. I gave her [a voucher] and offered her wine or beer; which she would have gotten in her [original] seat anyway. She seemed calmer and thanked me a lot.Later; I spoke with the [commuting] pilot and reminded him the importance of wearing masks around customers; and that one did move herself back because he wasn't wearing his. After I told him the first time (before door was closed) to put it back on; he kept it on except when eating or drinking. The man behind him; however; I told twice more (three times total including before door was closed) to put his mask on. Once inflight when I was collecting trash and he was sleeping. He had his mask all the way below his chin; near the collar of his shirt so that it didn't even look like he had one there. And another before landing; when I was doing my final compliance check. There was another guy in main cabin who fell asleep twice and I had to shake him awake and remind him to put his mask up; but his was covering his mouth; it just wasn't over his nose. I checked on the customer in XYA again and told her I spoke with that pilot again; and he has complied with mask requirement since the door was closed. Hopefully he just forgot and takes the mask requirement seriously. I only told him once; so I'm not sure how long he had it off or if he was eating before and just forgot to put it back on. I spoke with flight deck before I spoke with that commuter because our paper work and guest service tool app did not say there was a non-rev seated in Z4. So I asked FD if maybe he was listed as jumpseater; which didn't make sense because there were enough seats for all the non-revs to get on and he had higher priority. So I told FD about the customer complaint about that commuting pilot. When I spoke with him; he said he asked gate agent for a seat without the bulkhead; since he was originally given seat A3. So it seemed the woman who was seated in Z3; was swapped to A3. And the pilot was moved to Z4. I'm not sure exactly.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that many passengers; including a commuting pilot; were not compliant with the face mask policy.,"The incident involved a flight attendant addressing multiple instances of non-compliance with the face mask policy during a flight. The primary cause was several passengers, including a commuting pilot, not adhering to the mask requirements. During the boarding and pre-flight processes, the flight attendant noticed that some individuals, particularly in the exit rows and front sections of the aircraft, had their masks down or off. These included a pilot who initially had his mask around his chin and a passenger seated behind him who had his mask completely off. The flight attendant reminded these individuals to properly wear their masks, and most complied after being asked. A passenger originally seated in a different area moved herself to an exit row, citing concerns about the lack of mask compliance in her original seat area. She later explained that she was stressed and had relocated due to the pilot's mask policy violation. The flight attendant apologized for the situation, provided a voucher, and offered refreshments to the passenger, who appeared calmer afterward. The flight attendant also addressed the commuting pilot again during the flight, reminding him of the importance of mask compliance. The pilot complied after the reminder, and the flight attendant confirmed with the flight deck that the pilot had adhered to the policy post-reminder. The incident was resolved through the flight attendant's reminders and communication with the affected individuals, and no further issues were reported during the flight.",mask policy

I told them once we're finished boarding we can see if there's empty seats or you can talk to the gate agent if not. One of them sits across in XX4 for time being. Customer Service Agent (CSA) comes on and says someone else is assigned that seat. He goes back to see who should be in that seat; comes back and finds him sitting in row XY next to someone; I guess they knew each other. So the other customer stays in XX4.The customer in Y2 was also seated next to a stranger; and asked about moving up to row 1. I said unfortunately because we have seating caps; first class is at its max up there. I said once CSA comes back you can talk to him. I go to get a trash bag to collect the purell wipes; and he's right behind me when I turn around. I was confused why he was there all of a sudden. He said he would go talk to the gate agent. I told him to make sure he has all his bags if he's stepping off; but didn't understand why he didn't just wait for GA to come back. Because he had to come back to sort out the customers in row XX. And he asked why he had to take his things; thinking that meant he'd miss the flight. I asked why not just wait in your seat until the gate agent comes back; and he calmed down and nodded; saying that's a better idea. I guess he didn't hear me when I initially told him to wait for CSA to come back. Then CSA comes on and finishes sorting [out] XX12. Then he talks to Y2 and says exactly what I told him about seat caps; maybe he told him something more I'm not sure. Y2 kept complaining about the whole row 1 being open; and why can't he sit there; as if nobody explained the covid seating caps to him (both me and CSA did).Then; I finish collecting wipes and notice XX2 has a lace mask. Like lacey dress or underwear material; super thin with holes in it. And I ask if she has a regular mask without holes; or we can give one to her. And she has a startled/insulted look on her face; and says how she needs the holes because 'I can only breathe out of my left nostril.' I told her if it's a medical concern; it's not showing up on our end; and we weren't informed of any passengers with medical exceptions. So we would need to talk to the CSA and get that on your booking; so you can get an exception. And then she says how she flew with that mask from ZZZ; and it was fine. I told her it was possible nobody noticed on those flights; and unfortunately it's not allowed. Even if nobody else noticed before; that doesn't mean I can ignore it when I notice.So I go back up and flag down the CSA as he's closing the jetbridge doors. And I ask him about any medical exceptions; and he said nobody was approved for that and that he didn't notice anyone with a lace mask. So he says he'll be back with a mask. We have masks onboard but it was better he did that because she was already giving me attitude about it. He comes back and asks who it was and I said XX2; one of the ones we were talking with earlier. He goes back and gives her the mask and comes back saying how she told him that she wore that mask from ZZZ and I that he told her that it doesn't matter what happened on previous flights. Basically the same stuff from when I spoke to her.She got past him during boarding; then the other FA up front; then me in back during the whole seat issue; and then the GA again when he helped with the seat issue. And it wasn't until near departure time that I even noticed. So I think there's a good chance that on her other flights; those CSAs and FAs didn't notice either.Also; it was obvious she didn't have a medical exemption because she told me she needs a hole-y mask since she can only breathe out of 1 nostril. What I did not tell her was that she was speaking to a FA who hasn't been able to breathe out of either nostril in years because of a medical issue; and I was wearing a regular mask just fine. Iwould feel blessed if I could breathe out of even just one nostril. Somehow she didn't think that breathing out of one's mouth alone is possible in a mask. And I know I'm not the only FA with a similar sinus issue; too; and we all wear regular masks.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that several passengers had seat location issues and another passenger was not wearing a proper face mask.,"The incident occurred during a flight, involving several passengers and the flight attendant (FA). The first issue arose when passengers in seats XX1 and XX2 requested to move due to discomfort sitting next to strangers. The FA explained that seat assignments would be sorted by the Customer Service Agent (CSA) upon boarding completion. One passenger moved to seat XX4, which was initially assigned to another passenger. The CSA eventually resolved the seating arrangement.
The second issue involved a passenger in seat Y2, who sought to move to row 1 but was informed that first class was at capacity. The passenger grew agitated and insisted on speaking to the gate agent. The FA advised the passenger to wait for the CSA, who later confirmed the seating restrictions. Despite efforts to explain, the passenger continued to complain about the seating policy. The final issue occurred when the FA noticed a passenger in seat XX2 wearing a lace mask with holes, which violated the airline's mask policy. The passenger explained that the mask was necessary due to a medical condition, but the FA noted that no medical exception had been filed. The FA referred the passenger to the CSA, who provided a proper mask. The passenger was initially resistant but ultimately complied. The incident was resolved when the CSA ensured the passenger in seat XX2 complied with the mask policy, and the other passengers were reassigned seats as needed.",mask policy

After we did the demo I walked back to compliance and saw that the mother; in [seat] XX4; the face mask was below her nose and when I got closer she pulled it up. The three kids in [seats] XX 123 pulled their masks up and kept them on. I turned to the mother and said that 'I need your mask to stay over your nose at all times.' As I'm saying this she has it pinched between her finger pulled away from her face. She snapped back; 'It's there or it's covering' something along those lines and dismissively continued her conversation with the woman across from her. When I walked to the front of the plane before the demo I told the woman in XX3 to follow the mask policy so XX4 knew we were enforcing it. After my first encounter I informed the crew that I already talked to her and received attitude back and for them to keep an eye out.My second encounter was shortly after that when I went to pass out the [snacks] to the family next to her. As I walked up the mask again was down below her nose and when she saw me there she moved it up. I told her I really need her to keep the mask up and she snapped that it was up. I said it wasn't a moment ago and that I didn't want to have any issues on this long flight. Her responses to that was did I know that the politicians didn't believe in masks and I told her that this wasn't political; it was me doing my job to enforce our policy. She continued to give me attitude and talking about it was political. I went to the back and informed Flight Attendant (FA) C and D how my second encounter went and that she would be an issue the remainder of the flight and I strongly believe we should give her the Warning. They both offered to be the one to talk and give it to her. Flight Attendant C took care of that.While passing out the snack mix; I got to the row the husband was in. He asked for the wife's snack and his mask was down and FA D asked him to make sure his mask was up. XX4 had some kind of response that I missed but FA D told her not to have attitude towards us when we were just doing our job. Then she responded as a victim; saying she's been yelled at the whole flight and that she has been talking to us respectfully and not yelling at us. Which is not the truth because my encounters with her were very unpleasant; disrespectful and had the intent to belittle me and the policy.The remainder of the flight the entire family didn't comply with the mask policy. Their son rarely had the mask on when I passed; the daughters below their nose and the husband as well even though he would pull it up as we passed by. We all spoke to the family at one point and most of us multiple times. The mother was constantly having the mask below her nose or pulling the mask away from her face as she spoke to her kids and the woman across from her.

I asked her to cover her nose and mouth with her mask. She does not comply. She asks 'does this plane have oxygen? I can't wear this mask.'  I ask her if she is telling me she has a condition that requires oxygen during the flight then she needs to bring an approved Oxygen Canister on the flight. Meanwhile the passenger in [seat] YY1 sits down; mask below nose; and will not comply with many requests from me to pull her mask to cover her nose. I call the Captain to have him contact a Supervisor to remove these passengers and to let him know the passenger who sat in ZZ1 was demanding that I administer oxygen.

The first passenger, seated in XX1, was observed with her mask below her nose and did not adhere to requests to properly cover her nose and mouth. She questioned the oxygen policy, prompting the flight attendant to inquire if she required an oxygen canister, which she did not provide. Another passenger in seat YY1 similarly failed to comply with mask requirements, despite repeated requests. The flight attendant contacted the captain, who in turn reached out to a supervisor to address the situation. A passenger attempting to sit in the incorrect seat (XX2) was redirected to his assigned seat, which he complied with. However, another passenger in seat YY2 became confrontational, invading the flight attendant's personal space and expressing dissatisfaction with her approach. The flight attendant informed the passengers that those not complying with mask policies would be removed, and she summoned the captain again. Paramedics arrived and removed the passenger in seat ZZ1 from the flight. The station manager later arrived and was informed that the passengers in seats YY1 and YY2 needed to be removed for mask non-compliance and interference with crew duties. As a result, all identified passengers were removed from the flight, allowing the journey to continue safely.

This passenger felt he was not going to wear mask as required. FA B advised gate agent row and seat area and agent opened up the location and verified passenger's information.  Due to constant resistance FA felt safer not to confront passenger directly. During 3 points this party was given clear instructions on mask covering requirements and possible travel denial.  They continued during every stage with 4 different advisory points pre-board at gate; boarding (flight attendants);  flight introduction (Captain's announcement) and inflight (flight attendants).

Flight Attendant repeatedly requested both passengers to comply, and while they eventually raised their masks, they did so with resistance and defiance. Passenger X, in particular, responded confrontationally when reminded of the policy during snack service. The flight attendant emphasized the policy each time, and both passengers ultimately complied, though with evident reluctance and attitude.

The face mask policy announcement has since been changed to reflect the face mask must be worn except while eating or drinking for a brief moment.In the future I will report on any employee if they are non-compliant since employees set the tone and pace on the flight. When employees don't comply with policy or procedures passengers think they can do the same and not comply.

Subsequently, the Flight Attendant noticed a passenger in seat X4 and his wife not wearing masks while watching a movie. Despite the attendant's requests, the passenger refused compliance. Other passengers complained about this, prompting the attendant to make an announcement reiterating the mask policy. Following this, the policy was updated to specify that masks are required except when eating or drinking briefly. The Flight Attendant indicated a commitment to report future employee non-compliance, emphasizing that employee adherence sets the standard for passenger behavior. The attendant also suggested that the airline should ensure employees follow policies to prevent passenger non-compliance.

Masks have to be made of solid material.So thinking the gate agent would say something to her about the mask Passenger X boards the plane and takes her seat wearing her mesh mask. FWD Flight Attendant (FA) sees this and questions it and then calls me for a reference. I stated to her; I don't think it's an approved mask for flying; let me find it in the manual before going to Passenger X. While I'm trying to find it; FWD FA sends a message to the gate agent about Passenger X wearing this mesh mask.  FWD FA also informs the Captain as well. After searching under COVID section; I find it and inform FWD FA and the Captain that it's not approved and that I'll inform her that her mask is not compliant. I approach Passenger X about her mesh mask and also show her in manual that it's not compliant. Passenger X makes a statement that she's been allowed to wear it on her flights. I then read the mask compliance portion in the manual verbatim. She makes a little fuss about it and then states 'Fine; hand me a mask.' I tell her 'Thank you.' I head back up to the FWD part of the cabin; galley area to inform FWD FA and Captain we're good. Passenger X switched out her mask for one of our mask.

They said something to me about it after my break along the lines that she was upset and combative. I was surprised; as I wore my mask (a KN95 on the ground and a solid multi-layer cloth one in the air) all times outside of the flight deck and in the flight deck if a Flight Attendant was present.  Additionally; the other First Officer did as well. The Captain wears glasses that fog easily with a mask on. He wore a mask on the ground; he did not airborne because it would greatly interfere with his duties both because he wouldn't be able to see and could not communicate. This was our 4th leg together and we had no issues with masks among ourselves or other flight attendants.  Additionally; both the Captain and other First Officer already had COVID which they had gotten from people they knew at home; not in the workplace. Before our next rest room break I got out a new unused N95 mask for the Flight Attendant that would be in the flight deck while I was in the bathroom. When I called back and ask for the break she ordered me that the pilot remaining in the flight deck should wear the crew oxygen mask.  I said that was not something that we did anymore-the practice stopped months ago because of COVID.   I offered her the N95 for extra protection because the Captain can't wear a mask and do his job.  She refused it.  Instead continuing to wear what appeared to be a single layer stretchy black cloth mask. Additionally the flight attendant blocking the cart was wearing a KN95 but the Lead FA did not send her into the flight deck. I found the flight attendant to not be willing to exercise self-help and any wearing of an N95 and apparent multiple complaints to be a distraction from my flight duties. This was not good for crew CRM. While the single pilot on the flight deck; I was distracted from monitoring the airplane by her distress and complaints.,,,,Air Carrier First Officer reported poor CRM with the Lead FA regarding the company face mask policy on the Flight Deck.,"The incident arose from a disagreement between the Lead Flight Attendant and another Flight Attendant regarding the company's face mask policy on the flight deck. The Lead Flight Attendant offered an N95 mask as an extra precaution, given the Captain's difficulty in wearing a mask while fulfilling his duties. This offer was refused, with the flight attendant continuing to wear a single-layer cloth mask. This refusal led to the flight attendant's distress and complaints, which distracted from crew coordination and resulted in a reported issue with CRM (Crew Resource Management). The Lead Flight Attendant's attempt to mitigate the situation by providing additional protection was met with resistance, highlighting a compliance concern with the established mask policy.",mask policy
