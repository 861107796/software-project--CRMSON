Crew voiced concerns about the finding and I held conversation with Captain about crew concerns. Captain initiated a conversation with operations; and I went to the rear of the plane to investigate the situation further. The biohazard bag had not been closed so I put on gloves and carefully looked  inside. The contents were soiled; linens; wipes; and the dustpan from the large bag. After discussion with the crew; we agreed that we were happy to put the bag into a sealed container as we knew what the contents were. I returned to door; and reported my findings to the Captain and also of the conversation amongst the crew. Had the bag being sealed and tied it was agreed amongst the crew that none of us were happy or comfortable; taking the bag on a flight due to security concerns; and we would have wanted to have had the bag removed. This situation could have been avoided had there been more time to do a thorough cleaning of the aircraft and for the flight attendants to do their thorough checks before passengers; started boarding,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported notifying the Captain of a 'Bio hazard' container of soiled linen during departure taxi.

At no time was the entertainment system switched off prior to; during or following the demonstration. Once the demonstration was complete I went to the aft galley; where only 3 FAs (Flight Attendants) sit; and offered to be a 4th FA and sit at jump seat  and assume FA #8. I was in uniform and willing to assist. A short while later the Purser came to the back galley and informed me that she only wanted working"" FAs to be involved and asked that I return to my seat in the cabin. As the aircraft approached the runway there was no command from the Flight Deck to assume the demonstrated brace positions which made something of a mockery of performing an evacuation demonstration. After landing and deplaning the DHD (Deadhead) FAs were then converted to work the sector departing some 5 hours later at XA50 landing in ZZZZ airport at XK33; meaning extreme fatigue ensued due to being awake for approx. 27 hours prior to landing. The operating Pilots and FAs were released from duty following the incident yet the DHD crew onboard were not afforded the same courtesy even though they had less hours available to them and had experienced the same situation.""",,,,An off-duty Flight Attendant reported while dead heading the aircraft had an issue with the landing gear and offered to assist with safety procedures but was denied.,"The incident involved an off-duty Flight Attendant (Party1) who attempted to assist during a safety procedure on a flight. The aircraft experienced an issue with the landing gear, prompting the captain to conduct a preparation for land evacuation demonstration. During this time, Party1, who was in uniform and seated in the cabin, volunteered to assist by taking on the role of FA #8 at the jump seat in the aft galley. However, the Purser (Party2) denied this offer, instructing Party1 to return to their seat in the cabin, stating that only working Flight Attendants should be involved in the safety procedure. After landing, the off-duty Flight Attendants (deadhead crew) were reassigned to work the next departing flight, which caused significant fatigue due to being awake for approximately 27 hours. This decision was particularly challenging because the deadhead crew had less time available compared to the on-duty crew, who were subsequently released from their duties. The inconsistency in treatment and the denial of assistance led to frustration among the deadhead crew, who felt their efforts and well-being were overlooked despite being part of the same incident. A proposed solution is to ensure fair treatment and consideration for all crew members, including those deadheading, in such situations.",between attendant and crew

Two passengers; the one I was talking to; and another let me know that they had laptops in their bags. I let the A-FA know what was going on so that he could help monitor what was going on; and the passengers went to the front of the plane to retrieve their laptops. I let the CA and Gate Agent know what was going on when I was able to make it to the front of the plane because the passengers had come back down the aisle and said the Ramp person; or someone; had told them the cargo hold was closed and they weren't going to get them. It's my understanding that all laptops and lithium batteries need to be taken out and are unable to go in that cargo area; so that is when I spoke with the Captain and Gate Agent. The Captain said we would wait. The passengers then came back again and said the CA said that it was ok to go due to the size and them being off. I checked with the CA one last time and he deemed it safe. I was not there for the conversation when they declared it safe; so I can only go with the CA telling me it is safe.If something was deemed safe by the CA then I go with that; but just everyone checking bags beforehand; Gate Agents and also ramp crew not saying no due to potentially just not wanting to get the bag. But if it's declared safe; it's declared safe.,,,,ERJ-170 Flight Attendant reported to the Captain and Gate Agent that two passenger bags with laptops that had lithium-ion batteries were mistakenly gate checked in cargo during boarding. The Captain then deemed it safe to not remove as the devices were off and approved gate departure.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) who identified two gate-checked bags containing laptops with lithium-ion batteries during boarding. The flight attendant informed the other flight attendant and the captain about the situation, as these items are prohibited in cargo holds due to safety regulations. Two passengers confirmed they had laptops in their bags, and they retrieved them after being instructed to do so. However, the passengers reported that ground personnel had initially prevented them from retrieving the laptops, stating the cargo hold was closed.

We had been on this aircraft for 3 legs. The second leg was ZZZ1 to ZZZ flight. I had notice the door; closing on a swift swing than a slight click for closure. I was uncomfortable with that and reopened and closed the door. On; the next flight; ZZZ to ZZZ1; we rushed boarding; with a full flight and a jump seater. I had done my drink orders. Boarding was complete and the Captain said it was ok to close the MC (Main Cabin) door. After flight attendant B said cross check; I didn't feel like the MC door had closed completely. So; I asked; the Captain if the flight deck indicator said my door was locked and he replied no. I was thinking I needed to resecure the door. In feeling a time limit; I rushed to open the door it felt heavy and I felt the resistance so I only cracked it before I saw a little part of the grey slide appearing.  I stopped opening  the door and told the captain. The Captain was trying to communicate to the jet bridge driver and calling the necessary people and the jet bridge driver and supervisor did the same.  I noticed the  door was armed; when the airport managers came over and took pictures. The Captain made a PA. Passengers calmly deplaned by 2L door with their belongings and went to the boarding area at the next gate. No one was hurt or injured; When we reached the gate area we were met with  appropriate authorities per procedures. After the debrief  the Captain and I realized that we had a miscommunication about the door. Thankfully;the slide was not fully deployed until the passengers were off the aircraft.,,Boarding had been completed and I was ensuring compliance while waiting for A FA (Flight Attendant) to close door.  After the initial complaint check my A FA made PA to prepare doors for departure and cross check.  I armed the L2 door; verified it was armed and crossed to R2 door and did the same.  I made the PA that cross check was complete and cabin was ready for push back. I picked up demo equipment and started to walk towards the front of cabin when I received a call from A FA; they told me that they blew the L1 slide. Then the captain and airport officials coordinated deplaning from the L2 door. Once air stairs were in place; my disarmed door was opened by a Gate Agent and we deplaned all passengers.,,Flight Attendants reported the A Flight Attendant deployed the escape slide at the gate while attempting to close the main cabin door.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant attempted to close the main cabin door, mistakenly deploying the escape slide. The cause stemmed from the Flight Attendant's concern about the door's closure, which led her to reopen and check it. During this process, the slide deployed. The Flight Crew and airport officials coordinated the safe deplaning of passengers using the L2 door and air stairs. The result was a successful, injury-free evacuation. The debrief highlighted a miscommunication regarding the door status, leading to the incident. No explicit solution was proposed, but the situation was managed effectively, with the crew learning from the miscommunication.",between attendant and crew

Upon gate arrival; the Flight Attendants asked 'was that wake turbulence?' I said yes but the seat belt sign was on and; in my opinion; wasn't greater than moderate wake. One Flight Attendant commented that they were in the aisles and they fell down. I asked if anyone was injured or any passengers asked for assistance. She responded no and no injury report was filed. Being in clear air; no reports of turbulence and we were not following a heavy aircraft; makes it nearly impossible to predict wake turbulence. The seat belt sign was on and that did help mitigate any injuries. A call back to the cabin to see if everyone was ok could have been used; but; being in the descent and not receiving a call from them gave me the understanding no injuries were encountered. Upon deplaning was the first time I heard that a flight attendant fell. Once again though; I asked if everyone was ok. She responded yes and no injuries were encountered or reportedBetter communication between cabin and flight crew would have helped. Nobody was hurt; aircraft had no damage and the flight ended routine.,,During descent; we experienced a minor wake turbulence event.  No reports from the Flight Attendants during the descent.

Between ZZZ1 and ZZZZZ Captain did a normal system monitor check. Upon looking at the COND page; he noticed the AFT Cargo Temp at 180 degrees (Steady Green); asked me if I had seen a temp that high; I replied No! We kept an eye on it; over the next 10 minutes; noticed it rising to 188 degrees; then 194 degrees (still Steady Green) where it stayed for the duration of the flight. This made us uncomfortable for normal Cargo Bay temperatures in my 3;000+ hours flying this aircraft at 2 different airlines have never exceeded cabin temperatures during cruise. We simultaneously started looking into what could be a catastrophic problem. I got into the QRH AOM/FOM/and other manuals to look for temperature limitations and fixes. I found none; anywhere. During the same time; Captain got on the Phone with Operations and phone patched to Maintenance Control; where they attempted multiple resets to no success. When Captain got off the phone with Maintenance; he said; 'Well nothing fixed It; and they (Maintenance) said we are on our own.'At that point; we agreed as a crew that we didn't know what was going on down there. We were both not comfortable taking an aircraft with this indication over water; with limited divert options to an international location; and with no company or Contract Maintenance at the destination not knowing what was going on down there. The indication was steady at this point; not rising higher [than] 194 degrees; nor giving any other indications to the back when we notified the Flight Attendants and told them what was going on. At this point; we felt we were not in a land as soon as possible scenario; but in a land as soon as practical scenario but keeping land as soon as possible options available and we decided to divert to ZZZ2. We gave ATC a PAN PAN call since we were going to a divert airport that wasn't our alternate but that we were not at the time an emergency aircraft; we just wanted to have all our bases covered. We notified Dispatch both via phone patch and ACARS. During descent we were cleared the ZZZZZ Arrival to ZZZ2.We were still grossly overweight with a lot of gas; so we referenced the overweight Checklist. With that; we decided that with the condition still not worsening from what had been continuously indicated with no secondary indications or issues coming from the cabin; Captain and I both agreed that in an effort not to compound the problem we should hold to burn down gas; but having immediate [landing] options nearby; so we held at ZZZZZ1 at 16;000 ft. for 30-40 min and got to a calculated weight that would put us on deck in ZZZ2 right at Max landing weight. We continued to ZZZ2 via the arrival; for an uneventful Runway XX landing. On a side note; the XX transition from the ZZZZZ Arrival is a bit of a slam dunk. We asked for a bit longer final to get down; stabilized; and situated; and ATC approach gave us a few last second altitude; headings; and speed amendments through final which started to task saturate us as we prepared for landing. For example: open descent from 6;000-3;000; we were told to amend altitude and maintain 4;000 ft. while passing 4;200 feet; thrust idle; and speed brakes out. We blew through the altitude and had to climb back up Auto Pilot off; ALT horn blaring; and engines spooling up to 80+%; and getting speed brakes back in. We were also given several headings through final; and were asked to slow to final approach speed 10 plus miles outside the final approach fix at 4;000 feet; and approach didn't give us an approach clearance until we had flown through the glide slope on the localizer; and had to join from above; in order to sequence aircraft landing [Runway] XYL; which started to compound our landing configuration planning; and a go around was not something we were hoping to do; especially off of a PAN PAN call. We later found that on a couple of occurrences; ATC did not pass the PANPAN or divert info from Center to Center to Approach. We were later reassigned upon arrival to fly a ZZZ3 Turn that left in 5 minutes.I told Company that we just went through a lot; and that if they wanted us to fly that turn; that I needed a break for an amount of time that I was setting; some food; and so the Captain and I went and had a sit down meal; decompressed; talked about what had happened; after an hour or so I assessed my fitness for duty and felt I was good to fly the turn. The Captain and I were sitting on the jet; and when we called for push going to ZZZ3; Ramp told us to hold and that Maintenance wanted to talk to us. The maintenance team member got on the radio; asked if we were the crew that brought Aircraft X in from ZZZ; I replied yes; and he told us we needed to fill out a fume report. Captain asked what he was talking about; and told him this was the first we have heard about any fume incident. The Maintainer on the radio said the Flight Attendants had filed a fume report after the flight; and we needed to do the same. The Flight Attendants never told us anything about fumes nor their intent to fill out any such reports. Captain then filed a fume report said he had no information to give for we knew nothing about it. I felt Captain had communicated very clearly what was going on to the flight attendants about the situation; and our intent to divert. They had never communicated any such issues during any duration of or after the flight. Unknown from the high temperature in the Aft Cargo Bay. We did later saw that Maintenance replaced the sensor in the aft cargo bay via the app. We were curious that with all the ZZZ team members in Training vests if maybe they stacked the bags in the aft cargo bay above the line and possibly covered the sensor or did something to It. However; As far as the 'suspected' fume event; there was no communication from the flight attendants to the cockpit crew for this event. We noticed via the app that Maintenance later deferred the APU to prevent 'further fume events' due to the suspected fume event we were later notified about from ZZZ2 Maintenance. Not sure why if there is a fume event (or even a suspected fume event) why they don't further investigate the problem or fix the problem; rather than just pencil whip it into deferment. If there was any fumes in this situation; how would MX (Maintenance) know they came from the APU and not from any potential problem we were encountering? Put quick reference limitations on a Cockpit Card or in the QRH or checklist to quickly reference for situations such as these. I felt like we were on an Easter egg hunt for something that we later found wasn't there which wasted a lot of our decision making time. I know that Airbus FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) and other manufacture manuals/reference material has such limitations for quick reference from my experience at a previous Airbus airline. Why can't the company get on board with Airbus??? Make sure Flight Attendants communicate to the cockpit if they were smelling fumes.,,,,A321 First Officer reported an abnormally elevated Aft Cargo Bay temperature during cruise. After conferring with maintenance; the flight executed a precautionary diversion for maintenance.,"The incident involved an A321 flight crew (Party 1) and a flight attendant (Party 2). During the flight, the crew noticed an abnormally high aft cargo bay temperature (194 degrees), which was above standard operating parameters. The crew consulted manuals and contacted maintenance but found no immediate solution. Concerned about the situation, particularly over water with limited diversion options, the crew decided to divert to ZZZ2. They made a PAN PAN call to inform ATC and contacted dispatch. During descent and landing at ZZZ2, the crew encountered challenges with overweight landing conditions and ATC communication, but the landing was uneventful. Post-landing, maintenance informed the crew that a fume report had been filed by the flight attendants, though the crew had no prior knowledge of fumes or related issues during the flight. Maintenance deferred the APU to prevent further fume events. The crew expressed concerns about the lack of communication from the flight attendants regarding the suspected fume event and questioned the adequacy of maintenance's response. They recommended improved communication protocols between the cockpit and cabin crew, better access to quick reference materials for such situations, and a more thorough investigation of potential issues instead of deferred fixes.",between attendant and crew

The B-FA also informed the A of the error.I believe I should have been more involved with the bag; I thought the bag was being dealt with by Ground Ops properly. The combination of a new Ops Agent; and a new FA; I was getting food (terminal) were all contributing factors.""",,,,Air Carrier Captain reported a miscommunication between the Captain and a Flight Attendant regarding a gate checked smart bag that was erroneously loaded in the cargo compartment. The smart bag was relocated to passenger cabin prior to gate departure.,"The incident arose from a miscommunication between the flight captain and a flight attendant regarding the handling of a smart bag. Contributing factors included the inexperience of the new ops agent and flight attendant, as well as the captain's distraction while retrieving food, leading to a lack of direct involvement in the bag's handling. The flight attendant initially gate-checked the smart bag, which was later identified as requiring special handling. The ops agent retrieved the bag from the cargo area after being notified. During the flight, the captain noticed the bag in the cabin and pointed out the policy violation. The flight attendant acknowledged the mistake, and the bag's handling was corrected. The smart bag was erroneously loaded into the cargo compartment but was later moved to the passenger cabin. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and involvement by the captain, especially when dealing with safety-sensitive items like smart bags. The captain reflected on the need to be more involved in the handling of such items and recognized the impact of new staff and distractions on communication. This awareness serves as a lesson for future operations.",between attendant and crew

The first class wasn't even deplaned. Only three people had deplaned while others were trying to get their bag down and deplane. I said no not at this point; which in turn the first cleaner gave me serious attitude. The Gate Agent came down; no mask on; with an attitude about us not letting the cleaners enter to clean. They had 12 people to clean; usually they have a shortage of cleaners. But we hadn't even had first class passengers cleared and they started coming on. I asked not yet; let the passengers deplane and this flight is a full flight. This is becoming a serious issue at times and passengers getting upset they can't deplane and usually the cleaners keep cleaning and not moving in so they can deplane. Understand at this time with COVID the importance of cleaning but passengers complain at me about cleaners not clearing so the could deplane. It's stressful enough with all we are dealing with no food drinks and upset passengers about what they can't have. Our passengers were moving quick and not stalling getting off.  When they were off we couldn't get our bags and personal items together.  The flight deck wasn't able to exit. I understand there is time a limit and all but this rushing is going to seriously cause problems with safety of crew and passengers.  I was wrong possibly and maybe for which i will follow these memo's I forgot about from now on. Just trying to give our paying passengers a pleasant and safe flight including safe deplaning.,,,,Flight Attendant reported there was no social distancing by the aircraft cleaners during deplaning and also stated the Gate Agent was not wearing a face mask.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and ground personnel during the deplaning process of a full flight. The cleaning crew requested early access to clean the first-class section before all passengers had deplaned, which the flight attendant initially refused. This led to tension, as the cleaning crew and a gate agent, who arrived without a face mask, displayed an attitude. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of passenger safety and deplaning efficiency, citing stress from COVID-related protocols and passenger concerns. After deplaning was complete, the crew faced delays in retrieving their belongings, and the flight deck remained inaccessible. The flight attendant acknowledged potential oversights and expressed a commitment to follow procedures, highlighting the need for safe and efficient passenger experiences.",between attendant and crew

We asked them to wait just a bit; as we had 4 wheelchairs; and our first-class cabin was still getting off. The cleaners told us they are instructed to get on right away. The Captain said No; they needed to wait till most of the aircraft had deplaned. A few of the cleaners were still trying to argue with us; even after the Captain had said they had to wait. There are no quick turns; as our cleaning procedures during this pandemic are totally opposite of the term quick turn. This also is dangerous for the passengers and crew. There is no room for cleaners in the galleys or in the aisle as we safety try to deplaned using the company's policy of social distance; and deplaning a few rows at a time.In addition; the cleaners are getting in the way of the flight crew full filing our FARs responsibilities and safety obligations; post cabin sweeps.

The flight attendant requested the incoming cleaning crew to wait before boarding, as passengers were still deplaning, including those needing wheelchairs, and social distancing protocols were in place. The cleaners refused, citing instructions to proceed immediately. The captain reinforced the need to wait, explaining that pandemic procedures prevent quick turnaround and that cleaners posed a safety hazard by obstructing the aisle and galleys, hindering the crew's safety obligations.

She stated 'could be electrical'. I stopped the aircraft; I got a minor whiff of something but it dissipated immediately. FO (First Officer) smelled nothing. We reported smoke in the cabin to ground and requested Airport rescue and Fire Fighting. We considered running the Smoke/AVIONICS SMOKE/Fumes but needed more information; (global assessment). I called up the 1st and she stated she was unaware of what was going on. I called back to the rear of the aircraft and 2nd stated it had begun to dissipate. After a brief discussion with FO; I elected to taxi to the gate and have Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting follow us and access the situation. Aircraft deplaned normally. 1st was unaware there was an issue 4th thought it was an electrical odor 2nd stated there was an odor but not a burning odor. He noticed a lite haze in the reading lights. [The possible cause] was primarily due to the dark cabin; communications among cabin crew. In a perfect world; there would have been better communication between all of the flight attendants; prior to calling up the flight deck. A more concrete assessment could have made with all eyes on the situation. Then the degree of urgency; and solid information can be transmitted more efficiently to the Captain.,,Taxiing to the gate on the terminal ramp we received a cabin call from the #4 FA (Flight Attendant) reporting smoke in the cabin. CA stopped the aircraft to assess the situation and asked if I smelled smoke or odor. I did not see or smell smoke or odor in the cockpit. CA said he sensed a brief odor but not burning. We called ground to request Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting due to the cabin smoke report. We discussed completing the Smoke/AVIONICS SMOKE/ Fumes checklist but after a follow up call to the FAs about the cabin environment the #1 said she didn't see or smell smoke or odor and #2 and #4 said the smoke/odor had dissipated. Due to close proximity to the gate CA decided to continue to the gate for further evaluation by the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting personnel. The smoke report was entered in the AML and the fumes report [was] completed.,,A319 flight crew reported a fume/smoke event during arrival taxi to gate.,"An A319 flight encountered a fume/smoke event during its arrival taxi to the gate. The incident began when the fourth flight attendant (FA4) detected an odor and reported smoke, suspecting it might be electrical. The flight crew, led by the captain, halted the aircraft and assessed the situation. The captain noticed a brief whiff of something, while the first officer detected nothing. They contacted ground control and requested the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) team. The flight crew considered their checklist for smoke/fumes but sought more information. Upon contacting the cabin, FA1 reported no smoke or odor, while FA2 noted a dissipating odor and a light haze in the reading lights. The captain, after consulting with the first officer, decided to proceed to the gate for ARFF evaluation. The aircraft landed smoothly, and passengers deplaned normally. The event highlighted the challenges of communication among cabin crew in a darkened cabin. The suggested improvement was enhanced communication to ensure a more informed and coordinated response, allowing for a clearer assessment and more efficient information transfer to the flight deck. The incident underscores the importance of effective communication among cabin crew to enhance incident handling and preparedness.",between attendant and crew

We had power (i.e. lights) but; we did not have any airflow (air conditioning). We were beginning to sweat profusely. I (FA) contacted the terminal Supervisor who patched me through to Agent; in the tower. I told him of our plight and passenger complaints and concerns. He said he would send someone immediately to turn on the air. This was approximately 20 minutes later. About 15-20 minutes later we still had no air. Passengers were getting very upset and many took their masks off. We made announcements stating that without airflow; it was even more important to keep their mask on since they could not social distance. I contacted the Supervisor again and insisted the passengers be let off the aircraft if we were not going to get airflow and we still didn't know anything about when the pilots would arrive. Approximately 10 minutes later the pilots boarded and stated we should never have begun boarding under those conditions. They got air up and we departed 15 minutes later. 1 hour and 10 minutes after boarding. I felt very; very unsafe in those conditions as did many passengers.We should never board without air conditioning during COVID. If the pilots are running late; a mechanic should be brought down to turn on the air. A few minutes would be acceptable but when the tower is contacted; something should be done in a timely manner. Flight attendants should be allowed to let passengers deplane under such extreme conditions where everyone's safety and health are put at risk.,,,,Flight Attendant reported passengers were boarded before the pilots arrived at the aircraft.

Y dealt with the passenger while X closed the doors and made an announcement, with both stating the cabin was secure. However, X assumed Y would finish her duties, and Y believed X had secured the cabin. The confusion arose when the captain opened the flight deck door, expecting the cabin to be secure but was unaware of the status. Both realized their mutual assumption led to the oversight.

I told her I would go to the back while she checked the doors for me. I went to handle the passenger and she did closed doors and made the announcement. We both said cabin secure. I noticed the flight deck door was closed and had assumed she had done cabin secure for me seeing as I was tending to this passenger and she had done door closure for me. I continued on with the safety briefing. Approximately one minute into the safety briefing the Captain opened the flight deck door to inform me that no one informed him of cabin secure. Me and Flight Attendant X both became aware that we had assumed the other person had secured the cabin door and quickly re-secured the cabin. We continued on with our briefing.I believe we both made the mistake because of the destructive passenger. I had assumed that while I was tending to this passenger she had took over all of my duties and she assumed that I was going to finish my duties once I got back up into the gallery. I also believe the pilots close the door on their own to keep warm which is why we had gotten confused on the door being close.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being distracted by a disruptive passenger and forgetting to advise the flight crew the cabin was secure and they were ready to depart.,"The incident involved a misunderstanding between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding the cabin security process. The flight attendant was distracted by a disruptive passenger who refused to wear a mask, leading to an oversight in communication. After addressing the passenger, the flight attendant assumed the flight crew had been informed that the cabin was secure. Similarly, the flight crew believed the flight attendant had communicated the cabin's readiness. This mutual assumption resulted in the cabin not being properly secured before the safety briefing began. Approximately one minute into the briefing, the captain noticed the lack of communication and informed the flight attendant, prompting both parties to re-secure the cabin promptly. The incident was attributed to the distraction caused by the disruptive passenger and the crew's assumption that the other party had handled their respective duties.

It was a busy time in the flight deck where I was trying to manage the safety of the push. The FO answered the call to the flight deck from the cabin while I was talking to the ground crew and ramp was talking to our flight and the flight next to us pushing off the gate. The ramp personnel had left several pieces of ground equipment in the way of our push from X1 and we were trying to find out about getting it moved. As all of that is going on the narrative that myself and the FO got from the FA seemed to be one of more a compliance with the mask policy than one of weight and balance. She told us there was a large child sitting in a seat for which they were ticketed next to their mother and the child was having a hard time wearing the mask. The FA told us that the mother was now saying the child was less than 2. The FA believed that the mother was saying the child was less than 2 to skirt our mask policy and we needed to change the count for weight and balance because the child was an infant. I tried to clarify with the FA about the child because it was not clear to me because she was telling me the child was not listed as an infant; had their own seat; and by the FAs thought it was more about the mask. My thinking was that for the child to have that seat a birth date would have to be listed when that seat was purchased. Previously the FAs and the gate agent had reconciled the count; and the FA thought the child was older than 2; so I elected to leave the weight and balance as it stood. We continued to our destination without further incident.It was a busy time in the flight deck when this issue was brought to my attention. After things had calmed down with push I should have checked back with the FA to make sure I was hearing everything she was trying to tell me. Factors for me with my decision making were the high workload at the time; alertness because of the late time of day of the departure and having been scheduled with early AM shows for the three days prior to this event.,,I walked through to do my cabin count and confirmed that I had a child in row XX just as it showed on the sheet. I had already asked the mom to get a mask on the child before we closed the weight/balance. She said the child did not have a mask so I brought her one. After the safety demo I walked through the cabin again for final compliance and saw the child was not wearing a mask. Mom said he had ripped it so I offered to get a new one. She then said that the other FA told her he didn't need one if he was under the age of 2. I was surprised to hear the child was an infant as he was quite large and had walked on board the aircraft by himself. I asked if he was still only 1 and she said he was not yet 2. I alerted the CA that I had possibly made a mistake in the count.  I mistakenly counted an infant as a child. I didn't ask how old the child was; it only came up because of non-compliance with mask policy.I honestly think she claimed the child was an infant in order to avoid dealing with the face mask.In the future I will make sure to ask passengers with small children if they are in fact under the age of 2.,,Air carrier Captain and a Flight Attendant reported a passenger's child was resisting wearing a face mask. After this problem started the parent then stated the child was under 2 and did not need to wear the face mask.,"The incident began when a flight attendant reported a passenger's child resisting the face mask policy. The mother claimed the child was under two years old, exempting the child from the mask requirement. The flight attendant believed this was an attempt to avoid compliance and sought to adjust the weight and balance count. The captain, managing a busy pushback and fatigued from early morning hours, decided to maintain the current count, as the child had a designated seat, suggesting the child was over two. Later, the flight attendant realized she had miscounted the child as a passenger rather than an infant, leading her to alert the captain. She concluded the mother had falsely claimed the child's age. Reflecting on the experience, the flight attendant vowed to verify the age of children in such situations in the future. The outcome was resolved without further incident, with the flight attendant learning to ask passengers about their child's age to ensure accurate counts and compliance.",between attendant and crew

I did a positive exchange of controls to the Captain since it was my PF (Pilot Flying) leg. He took controls as normal. Door unlocked and the crew swap went normal. Upon finishing in the lavatory the B FA called up to begin the next crew exchange. She informed me that the CA wanted to use the lavatory too. I was waiting in the galley expecting the A FA to come out so we could do the normal process of me sitting down; getting controls back; getting any flight updates; and then having the FA's call back up so the CA could use the lav. Instead; the flight deck door opened and out walked the CA. No one was at the controls; the A FA was in the process of moving from my seat to the CA seat. I immediately said 'she's supposed to come out first; no one is at the controls'. The CA responded 'oh; right' or something along those lines. The B FA and myself expressed our concerns over the incorrect lavatory exchange procedure. He then proceeded to open the lavatory door. Not go back into the flight deck. I rushed into the flight deck; sat down; got myself situated and locked the door since there was no pilot. I got the aviate; navigate done and now wanted to communicate. I asked the A FA what happened and she said 'I don't really know; he told me to switch seats with him so we squeezed past each other'. I told her that's not normal and that I needed to talk to the CA. The B FA called up; said the code word; and the CA came back in. I talked to him about what happened and he said something like 'oh right; that did seem strange'. I talked to him about the correct procedure which he; I assume; did not know. I told him we had no one at the controls and how dangerous that is. Upon getting to the hotel the FA's asked me if I was going to fill out a report. I called the Pilot Union Professional Standards to get their opinion on the situation. I used this as a teaching moment; however; the whole event should never have happened.,,,,First Officer reported that during a lavatory break; both pilots were out of the cockpit at the same time and the flight attendant was swapping seats in the cockpit; leaving the aircraft uncontrolled.,"The incident occurred during a flight when the First Officer (FO) and Captain (CA) were both absent from the cockpit, leaving the aircraft uncontrolled. The First Officer had informed the Captain of the need to use the lavatory, and the flight attendants (FAs) were expected to manage the cockpit exchange. However, during the crew swap, the flight deck door was opened, and the Captain entered the cockpit while no pilot was seated at the controls. Simultaneously, the A FA was in the process of moving from the FO's seat to the Captain's seat, creating a dangerous situation. The FO returned to the cockpit, retook control, and addressed the unsafe procedure with the Captain. The B FA also expressed concerns about the improper exchange. The incident was reported to the Pilot Union Professional Standards, and the FO used it as a teaching moment to emphasize the importance of proper cockpit procedures.

This was a direct violation of sterile cockpit procedures. Because flight crews repeatedly experience chimes from the cabin while in simulator training; they are most associated with fire or critical aircraft issues.

Reissued sterile cockpit etiquette with a bulletin on scenario that are and are not acceptable for chiming the cockpit during landing rollout.,,,,Captain reported a Flight Attendant distracted the flight deck crew during the landing rollout to inform them a passenger was not conforming to face mask policy.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant interrupted the sterile cockpit procedure during landing rollout to inform the flight crew about a passenger not complying with the mask policy. This action was contrary to established safety protocols, which reserve cockpit intercom use for emergencies. The flight crew, accustomed to associating such chimes with critical issues, were distracted, potentially compromising safety. The result was a report from the Captain. To address this, guidelines were reissued to clarify acceptable scenarios for cockpit communication during landing, emphasizing the importance of adhering to sterile procedures.",between attendant and crew

Cause - Delayed; passenger mask issue; bad headset.Suggestions - Finish a checklist or task before moving onto the subsequent item on a to do list. Before Start Checklist below the line was called for but right at that moment; we were simultaneously distracted by both Ramp Agent and the Flight Attendant with a passenger issue. We diverted out attention to the two external factors and did not finish the checklist. Had we appropriately created a boundary between what was most important at the moment; we would've not missed the checklist prior to push back. It wasn't until after push back commenced that we realized we had no completed the checklist.,,We were delayed significantly due to weather in ZZZ; there were distractions due to ramp headset squeals and a passenger issue regarding a mask.

The mitigation strategy was to continue our efficiencies until push back time. The distractions caused us to miss the completion of the before start checklist below the line until after push back started. We will be more careful next time.,,Air carrier flight crew reported deviations from standard practices due to distractions in the cabin; causing check list omissions.,"An incident occurred involving the flight crew and flight attendant of an air carrier, where deviations from standard practices led to the omission of a critical checklist. The delay, initially caused by weather in ZZZ, was exacerbated by distractions such as a ramp agent addressing a passenger's mask issue and a faulty headset. These distractions caused both the flight crew and attendant to overlook the completion of the ""before start checklist below the line"" prior to pushback. The crew, attempting to expedite procedures to minimize further delay, was overwhelmed by external distractions, leading to the missed checklist. This omission was only realized after pushback had commenced. The incident resulted in a deviation from standard operating procedures, highlighting the risks of rushing and not prioritizing tasks effectively. Both parties recognized the importance of establishing clear priorities and managing distractions to prevent such omissions. They resolved to improve task management and ensure adherence to checklist protocols in future operations, emphasizing the need for careful prioritization and boundary management to avoid similar incidents.",between attendant and crew

Another FA (Flight Attendant) who was scheduled to work 5/Y/21 ZZZ-ZZZ3-ZZZ2 would replace our A FA. At first the C FA and myself (B FA) thought the A FA would have to DH (Deadhead) on our flight and both the C FA and myself decided to take an earlier van ride to avoid any further distress caused by the A FA. But once C FA and myself realized the A FA was to work ZZZ-ZZZ3-ZZZ2 the C FA and me were relieved and comfortable to take the original van time of XA30am. When van came to pick up the D FA; C FA and myself our original A FA showed up as if nothing happened the previous day. On the previous day once the entire crew arrived to the hotel the A FA verbally attacked the Captain and First Officer. The A FA's hostility towards the pilots made the entire crew uncomfortable. I myself was visibly shaken by the A FA yelling and verbal attack on the pilots. Upon arriving to the airport the A FA walked off without us like the previous two days leaving us behind. When the C FA; D FA and me got to the gate the pilots were waiting in the gate area for us to discuss what we all were going to do as we were all in shock that the A FA was back on the trip without our knowledge of any change. The Captain was still backing up the decision to have the A FA removed but then it came down to what to do. The company put us in a situation making us work with the A FA whose behavior distressed the crew enough to adversely affect our work and well-being at work. The company's decision to have the A FA continue to work the flight created an unhealthy work environment. The crew was nervous and uncomfortable not knowing if there were to be another disturbance. It wasn't as if the flight was only an hour long we were flying across the ocean with nowhere to land if another disturbance were to arise. The C FA; D FA and myself all stayed away from the A FA as much as possible to avoid any further outbursts.,,The day prior after landing in ZZZ and arriving at the hotel; I; as well as the entire crew; had a situation happen with the A Flight Attendant. After speaking with the Chief Pilot as well as the Supervisor in the Operations Center; the decision was made to have the A Flight Attendant removed from her next flight. This decision was reached between the Supervisor and the B FA and C FA. I informed the Supervisor that I even thought I was OK with flying back with the A Flight Attendant. The B and C Flight Attendants were not; and that I was backing them up and would not force or require them to fly with her; against their wishes. The Supervisor said she would pull the A FA from the trip and we would have a new A FA. The situation was so bad that the B FA and C FA did not want to ride in the same van with the A FA the next day. The following day; when we reported for work; we found out that someone had put the original A FA back on the trip without notifying myself or the rest of the crew.I personally found out 45 minutes prior to departure; when I was given the paperwork to review and noticed her name on the Crew sheet. The B; C and D Flight Attendants were extremely upset about the situation and they were put in a very difficult position standing at the gate with over 160 people who were traveling back to the mainland. I asked the 3 Flight Attendants if they were going to be able to work with the A FA and also called the Operations Center to inform the Chief Pilot and the Supervisor about the situation. After the B; C; and D Flight Attendants agreed to work with her and we departed ZZZ. Upon our arrival in ZZZ2; the B FA informed me that it was a very awkward situation.,,Air carrier Captain and a Flight Attendant reported an unsuitable work environment due communication issues between the Captain and a Flight Attendant.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant (FA) and the flight crew due to the FA's hostile behavior toward the pilots, which created an uncomfortable and distressing work environment. On 5/X/21, it was decided to replace the FA for the flight on 5/Y/21, but the replacement was not communicated clearly to the crew. Initially, the crew believed the FA would deadhead (ride without working), but upon discovering she was to work the flight, they were relieved. However, the FA's previous hostile behavior toward the pilots caused the crew significant discomfort, especially after she reappeared on the flight without prior notification. On the day of departure, the crew was shocked to find the FA back on the trip, leading to an awkward and tense atmosphere. The Captain supported removing the FA but faced the dilemma of proceeding with the flight. The company's decision to keep the FA on the flight despite her disruptive behavior created an unhealthy work environment, leaving the crew nervous and unsure about the flight's safety. The flight was completed, but the situation highlighted the need for better communication and conflict resolution. The proposed solution was to honor the initial decision to replace the FA, ensuring a safer and more comfortable work environment for the crew.",between attendant and crew

We were confused by this question because we had been uniformed of any issues regarding our flight. Then he proceeded to tell us that there was an air quality issue with that aircraft. We were even more confused as to why we were not made aware of this issue and wanted confirmation or at least more information about what we were dealing with. He then left us and we began communication with CSS (Cabin Service System); and tried to contact a Supervisor. We then learned that it was in fact our aircraft; and they were now tail swapping it out of service. I am unclear on what we should be doing; if we should be concerned for our health; or be tested? I was under the impression that the Supervisor who first approached us would return with more information or at least confirm that it was our flight. I am not feeling well; but I am unsure now if I was already getting sick; or if it was caused or exasperated by this aircraft. I feel like we have been blindsided with some potentially health threatening news and left with no guidance.We need someone to be following up with us about what's going on and what the exact report entails so we can make an educated decision on how to proceed and weather to be tested or not.,,,,Air carrier flight attendants reported an 'air quality' issue after deplaning the aircraft.,"The flight attendant was approached by a supervisor after landing who informed them about an air quality issue with their aircraft.

They catered the front next. Upon completing catering; and when the R1 door was closed; I noticed that the warning strap was across the window. I immediately called it out and said 'why is that strap across the window'? The door was obviously disarmed as there was no slide deployment. D Flight Attendant was with me. The CSA (Customer Service Associate); who was waiting at the R1 door; then said 'you gave the caters a thumbs up when they knocked and the strapped was attached' which I do not recall doing. D Flight Attendant didn't see the warning strap in the armed position when she boarded the plane either. I immediately moved the warning strap to the disarmed position and noticed that the velcro strap on the extension piece was worn out to the point where the extension would not stay attached. It constantly fell down and hung.I told the First Officer as she was leaving the flight deck that we had an issue with the R1 warning strap. She indicated that they were about to time out and discounted my comment. I made her look at the strap. She came to the door and said 'no; it works; see'. I showed her that 4/5 attempts to place the strap on the Velcro didn't work; it would fall down. She said 'well you gotta talk to the Captain about it' and then entered the bathroom. I then proceeded to talk to the Captain. He stopped me before I even started and said 'if you tell me anything I am obligated to put it in the book; so is this really important?' I said yes; I have an issue with the warning strap. He also indicated that they had a timing issue and couldn't take any delays. I told them that I needed Maintenance. Maintenance came and fixed the strap. I don't know what happened with the strap being across the window in the armed position. I can only speculate that catering attached it while it was hanging down. If it was in place; they shouldn't have opened the door; the CSA should have also said something as she was waiting by L1; apparently watching; and the entire inbound crew should have checked upon deplaning. I find it odd that all of these checks would have been missed. Furthermore; I didn't appreciate being put in a position where I had to make the call if we were going to take a potential delay and possibly cancel the flight due to a timing out issue. My only job is to bring cabin discrepancies to the captain's attention. This was a poor example of CRM. This morning; I had a conversation with the Captain regarding the events yesterday and reiterated what I have written in this [report]; about poor CRM and putting me in an uncomfortable situation. He agreed and said they handled the situation poorly. As we are flying together today on an ETOPS flight to ZZZ; I didn't want to there be any communication issue before we left. Our conversation was pleasant and we cleared the air.,,,,Flight attendant reported a CRM issue developed with the flight deck crew after reporting there was a minor maintenance issue with an aircraft door.,"The incident arose from a maintenance issue with the R1 door warning strap, which the Flight Attendant noticed during cleaning. She reported the strap was improperly positioned and highlighted worn Velcro causing instability. Despite the First Officer and Captain dismissing her concerns initially, the Flight Attendant persisted, leading to Maintenance being called, who subsequently repaired the strap. The situation highlighted shortcomings in CRM, prompting a later discussion between the Flight Attendant and Captain, resulting in a commitment to improve communication and address such issues more effectively.",between attendant and crew

The aircraft was put on a hardstand with no tug where with guidance from the ramp crew we would be able to start both engines and be directed to the movement area of the ramp. After completing the Engine Start Check; I looked over to the Ramper and with their permission; I released the parking brake. I however; did not reengage the parking brake. I then directed the First Officer to start both engines. The number 2 engine was started first. Following the start of the number 1 engine; the First Officer stepped on the brakes and simultaneously engaged the parking brake. This caused the airplane to stop abruptly. I asked the First Officer why he did what he did; and he said that we were moving. I then said that it was my mistake for not having the parking brake engaged; but we were moving slowly and we were far from any equipment and people. I then asked the First Officer two questions Why did he not say to me that the aircraft was moving and I would have applied the brakes and why did he apply both the brakes and the parking brake at the same time ? He said that he was not sure the brakes alone would have stopped the airplane. We then proceeded with the rest of the normal checklists and taxied to the runway and departed. In flight; the Flight Attendant said she was injured from the whiplash and was bruised. She said she may see a doctor upon reaching our destination. At the end of the flight I exchanged my contact information with the Flight Attendant to keep me informed of her physical condition. The whole sequence of events started with me not engaging the parking brake after releasing it for the out time. The threat of not recognizing that we do not have rampers to tell us to reset the brake after push was not addressed during our threat discussion and mitigation. My error was not seeing the airplane moving after the number one engine started and stopping the airplane before the First Officer. The undesired state was the fact that the aircraft moved when it should not have causing potential harm to the ramp crew and outside equipment. The other error I would say was CRM. The First Officer acted in the interest of safety and was the first to recognize the movement of the aircraft. He however over reacted. Based on the fact the airplane was moving slowly and we were far from rampers and equipment; I think he should have told me that we were moving and I would have stopped the airplane. If I did not react he then should have stepped on the brakes. This was the error on CRM our part. After talking to him I found out that he just finished IOE recently and this was his first trip after completing IOE. I think lack of experience in actual line operations caused him to act the way he did. I also should have checked with the Flight Attendant to see how she was doing after the airplane came to a stop. What I learned was to be extra vigilant when you are taxiing out with no towbar from the gate. If we were close to people or equipment; this could have been bad. Addressing ramp operations with no tug driver telling you to 'set the brake' is a threat that we should have discussed and talked about. I also need to be more aware of aircraft (unintentional) movement in all situations and react appropriately.,,,,ERJ145 Captain reported the parked aircraft began rolling on the ramp and the First Officer put the brakes on and the parking brake causing an abrupt stop injuring a Flight Attendant.,"The incident involved an ERJ145 aircraft during its morning flight. The captain released the parking brake but failed to re-engage it, causing the aircraft to move on the ramp after the engines were started. The first officer, noticing the movement, applied both the brakes and the parking brake, resulting in an abrupt stop. A flight attendant sustained injuries from the sudden stop, including whiplash and bruising. The primary causes of the incident were the captain's oversight in not re-engaging the parking brake after releasing it and the first officer's overreaction to the aircraft's movement. The captain acknowledged a lapse in vigilance during ramp operations without proper communication from ground staff and attributed the first officer's actions to his recent completion of initial operating experience (IOE), indicating a lack of line operation experience. The captain learned the importance of being more vigilant when taxiing without a tug and emphasized the need to address ramp operation threats during pre-flight briefings. Additionally, the incident highlighted the importance of effective crew resource management (CRM) and clear communication to prevent similar occurrences.",between attendant and crew

First, catering personnel were not wearing masks, which contravened company health and safety protocols. Second, a non-revenue pilot was initially non-compliant with mask-wearing requirements. The flight attendant addressed the pilot, who initially refused but complied temporarily. Upon the attendant leaving, the pilot removed his mask again. The Purser intervened, reminding the pilot to wear his mask, to which he finally complied. The catering issue was reported but not resolved during the flight.

During the boarding process; the forward FA asked me if it was okay if a passenger moved from the aft of the aircraft to the front of the aircraft. I told her it was okay with me if she was comfortable with doing so; but that was the last communication that we had. After takeoff; I had a sudden realization that the passenger may have moved and that the passenger data/distribution from the auto-closeout may differ from our actual passenger distribution; therefore affecting the accuracy of our weight and balance and manifest. I had the FO call back to the FAs; who confirmed that the passenger did in fact move. After landing; the FA told me that she did not realize that we needed the updated passenger locations for our manifest/weight and balance numbers. This event was caused by a lack of communication by both parties. By not closing the communication loop; there was information that was not conveyed correctly and therefore caused a breakdown. The lack of further information from the FA led me to the assumption that the passenger was not moved; whereas in her opinion I had given her the OK to do whatever she needed to do and there was no need to report back with any changes. Additionally; we are so used to flights being full and the auto-close out process being so automated; that moving passengers is a relatively new occurrence that none of us were necessarily expecting; but that we should be aware of and expect to occur more in the future.During unprecedented times such as these where passenger loads are extremely light and the need to distance passengers may be necessary; and where the weight and balance process is now very streamlined and automated; it would be a great reminder for all crewmembers to be aware of the necessity to maintain accurate record of passenger location; and update the data in the MCDU to reflect where passengers are actually seated if it differs from the auto close-out data. Explaining to flight attendants the importance of this communication (having an accurate manifest and subsequently weight and balance data) may help all parties understand the importance of making these changes. I personally plan on briefing the crew during particularly empty flights; that they need to report any passenger seating changes to me prior to departure.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported that the aircraft departed with passenger distribution data different from the actual distribution due to one passenger changing seats. The Captain noted the aircraft was very lightly loaded and it was important to ensure an accurate record of passenger location; as this could affecting weight and balance data.,"The incident involved an aircraft departing with passenger data that did not match the actual seating arrangement due to a passenger changing seats. The cause was a lack of communication between the flight crew and the flight attendant. During boarding, the forward flight attendant had asked the Captain if a passenger could move from the aft to the front, receiving permission. However, there was no follow-up communication. After takeoff, the Captain realized the passenger had moved, leading to discrepancies in weight and balance data. The flight operations officer (FO) confirmed the move with the flight attendants. Post-landing, the flight attendant explained she hadn't realized the need to update the data. The proposed solution is for the Captain to brief the crew on the importance of accurate passenger data and communication, especially on low-load flights.",between attendant and crew

Engine; pressurization and pack indications were normal. The FO (First Officer) and I noticed that I had adjusted the temperature selectors full cold due to the very humid 100 degree conditions at ZZZ. We both agreed that the air conditioning systems had likely iced up based on previous aircraft experience. The FO selected higher temperatures to melt any ice. About a minute later; airflow returned to normal. At the same time we received an interphone call; which the FO answered; from FA1 (Flight Attendant 1) saying hot air was flowing into the cabin and it smelled like dirty socks. The FO said we turned the temperature up but would now turn it down and to call back if the problem did not get better. Cool air returned to the flight deck and cabin and we continued to ZZZ1 uneventfully. During the post flight walk around at ZZZ1; the FO discovered a bird strike in the right engine with feathers on the bypass fan blades and core compressor blades. During the van ride to the hotel; FA2; FA3; & FA4 said they called FA1 during the hot airflow incident on initial climbout and reported they smelled burned chicken; cooked chicken; and a burned bird strike smell. When FA1 called the flight deck; she said it smelled like dirty socks. My decision to continue to ZZZ1 would have [been] different if I had heard any words like burned; cooked; chicken; or bird strike. The decision of FA1 to not relay the very accurate observations of FA2; FA3; & FA4 to the flight deck was not good and could have allowed serious consequences to develop including engine failure; engine destruction; human injuries or loss of life. As a Captain; I listen very carefully to the observations of flight attendants and consider everything seriously. I suggest flight attendants do the same for each other.,,Upon initial climb out from ZZZ about a minute after takeoff about 2;500 ft; the flight deck vent airflow decreased significantly. Engine; pressurization and packs indications were normal. The CA (Captain) and I noticed that he had adjusted the temp. selectors to full cold due to very humid 100 degree conditions at ZZZ. We both agreed that the air conditioning systems had likely iced up based on previous aircraft experience. I turned the selectors at a higher temperatures to melt any ice. About 1 minute later; the airflow returned to normal. At the same time we received a call from the cabin. I answered it and FA1 (Flight Attendant 1) saying the hot air was flowing into the cabin and smelled like dirty socks. Which I repeated 'dirty socks' to make sure that was the smell. I told her we turned the temp up but would now turn it down. Also to call back it the smell or heat didn't get any better. I also called back about 5 min later to check on the smell and temp. The FA's did say the smell was going away or gone and temp was cooling down better. With the cool air returned to the flight deck and cabin; and we continued to ZZZ1 uneventfully. During the post flight at ZZZ1 I discovered a bird strike in the right engine. There was feathers on the bypass fan blades and the core compressor blades. During the van ride to the hotel; FA2; FA3; and FA4 said they called FA1 during the hot airflow incident on the initial climb out and reported they smelled burnt chicken; cooked chicken; and or a burnt bird strike smell. When FA1 called the flight deck she said it smelled like dirty socks. His decision to continue to ZZZ1 would have been different if he had heard any words like burnt; cooked; chicken; or bird strike. The decision of FA1 not relaying the very accurate observations of FA2; FA3 and FA4 to the flight deck was not good and could have allowed to something more serious.,,B737-800 flight crew reported communication issues between the flight deck crew and flight attendant crew regarding odor in the cabin.,"During the climbout from ZZZ after takeoff at 2,500 feet MSL, the flight crew noticed a significant decrease in airflow through the flight deck vents. The Captain adjusted the temperature selectors to full cold due to the extremely hot and humid conditions at ZZZ. Both the Captain and the First Officer (FO) believed the air conditioning systems had iced up based on prior experience. The FO then increased the temperature settings to attempt to melt any ice, and airflow returned to normal shortly afterward. At the same time, the flight deck received an interphone call from Flight Attendant 1 (FA1), who reported that hot air was flowing into the cabin and that it smelled like ""dirty socks."" The FO assured FA1 that the temperature would be adjusted and instructed her to call back if the issue persisted. The airflow and temperature in both the flight deck and cabin subsequently returned to normal, and the flight continued to its destination, ZZZ1, without further incident. Following the flight, the Captain discovered evidence of a bird strike on the right engine during the post-flight walk-around, including feathers embedded in the bypass fan blades and core compressor blades. During the ride to the hotel, other flight attendants (FA2, FA3, and FA4) reported that they had called FA1 during the initial climbout and detected smells resembling ""burnt chicken,"" ""cooked chicken,"" or a ""burnt bird strike"" odor. However, FA1 only described the smell as ""dirty socks"" when contacting the flight deck. The Captain emphasized that had he been aware of the more specific descriptions provided by the other flight attendants, his decision to continue to ZZZ1 might have been different, as the smells could have indicated a more serious issue such as engine damage or failure. The Captain highlighted the importance of clear and accurate communication among all crew members. He suggested that flight attendants should relay specific and precise observations to the flight deck to ensure that potential issues are fully understood and addressed. This could prevent more serious consequences, such as engine failure or other safety risks.",between attendant and crew

He said that he was about to start coughing.  Once inside the lav; we (myself and other passengers) could hear him coughing so hard that he was gagging.  2 passengers expressed concern.  When he came out; I asked if he was feeling alright.  He told me that it was just allergies and he didn't want to start coughing in front of everyone.  Twice; during taxi; I had to ask him to put his mask back on. (Note: if someone is eating or drinking; I leave them alone.  But he was reading and/or digging through his bags.)  In flight; as soon as I went upfront; we went into the lav again after 2 more lav visits; I went back and asked him again if he was alright.  He told me that he 'Wasn't feeling well;' but that it was because he hadn't eaten breakfast. We provided everyone with snack bags and I kept an eye on him.  After several more lav trips; I called the PIC and informed him of what was going on.  The PIC asked us if we had a way of taking his temp. We said no and suggested he call for a [customer service agent] to meet the flight.  Throughout the flight; Passenger X came back to use the restroom a total of 5 times and had to be told 3 times to; please; put his mask back on.  Just after we had taken our seats for landing; he came back for a 6th time and asked me to move so that he could use the restroom.  I told him that we were about to land and that he needed to return to his seat.  He wasn't happy; but complied.  After arriving at the gate; he came back to use the lav again.  The PIC called and asked if we (the FAs) would ask him to stay seated until everyone else had deplaned so someone to talk with him.  I asked him and he was very unhappy and agreed while yanking off his mask. I must have looked surprised because; after looking back at my face; he quickly put his mask back on.  He deplaned last and a [customer service agent] was there to meet him.  The other FA informed me that; when he first boarded the plane; he had immediately used the forward restroom.  That totaled 9 trips to the lav in 1.5-2 hrs and many requests to keep his mask on.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger using the restroom numerous times; coughing and having to constantly be reminded to wear a mask.,"During a flight, a **Flight Attendant (FA)** reported an incident involving a passenger, referred to as Passenger X, who exhibited unusual behavior. Passenger X used the restroom a total of **nine times** within a span of **1.5 to 2 hours**, which raised concerns among the crew and other passengers. Upon entering the restroom, Passenger X was heard coughing heavily, to the point of gagging, which worried two other passengers. When asked about his condition, he initially claimed it was due to allergies but later stated he was not feeling well because he had not eaten breakfast. The FA provided snack bags to all passengers and kept a close eye on Passenger X throughout the flight. Additionally, Passenger X was repeatedly reminded to wear his mask properly. The FA noted that he was reading or digging through his bags, which may have contributed to the need for mask reminders. The FA informed the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) about the situation, and the PIC requested that the FA check if there was a way to take Passenger X's temperature. Since the crew did not have a thermometer, the PIC suggested contacting a customer service agent to meet the flight. After landing, the PIC instructed the FA to ask Passenger X to remain seated until all other passengers had deplaned, so that someone could speak with him privately. Passenger X complied but was visibly unhappy and removed his mask in frustration. After noticing the FA's surprise, he quickly put the mask back on. Passenger X was the last to deplane and was met by a customer service agent at the gate. The FA later reported that Passenger X had used the forward restroom immediately after boarding the plane, adding to the total of nine restroom visits. His behavior created disturbances and safety concerns during the flight.",between attendant and crew

He said he would call Maintenance. I'm not sure whom he contacted but they told him 'If the FAs (Flight Attendants) need to use it; they just turn it on; it's fine.' I explained how the ELT should work and he directed me to move the switch to the ARM position. After the ELT's quick self-test it checked out as ready to operate.I am concerned that however long the ELT had been OFF that nobody noticed during their prefight equipment check. I also feel that Tech Ops/Flight Ops should have a better working knowledge of the equipment; or be able to quickly reference the information. Had I not questioned it; the equipment would have continued; as it apparently had already; to remain OFF.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported ELT in the OFF position.,"An incident occurred when a flight attendant discovered the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) in the OFF position during an equipment check, which should have been ARMED. The attendant notified the captain, who contacted Maintenance. Maintenance responded by advising the captain that the ELT could be turned on if needed, and the captain subsequently moved the switch to ARM after the attendant explained its operation. The ELT functioned correctly after a self-test. The incident raised concerns about the lack of awareness during pre-flight checks and the need for improved technical knowledge or quick reference resources among Maintenance and Flight Operations. Without the attendant's intervention, the ELT would have remained OFF, posing a potential safety risk.",between attendant and crew

I don't Remember the gate. It was my leg to fly to ZZZ1. We had some weather approaching from the south. Me and the Captain knew it was going to be a quick taxi being we were going to takeoff XXR. So we did preflight check at the gate and then when the flight attendants were ready they closed the flight deck door and then locked it. When the ramp crew was ready we did the push checklist. We started both engines as me and the Captain talked about because of the short taxi. Then we did the taxi check before we moved the aircraft due to the short taxi. We then taxied towards Runway XXR and during that time we did the before takeoff checklist. I'm pretty sure I called the back and told the flight attendants and cabin we were next for takeoff. After going through the checklist and noticed that the flight attendants did not call us. So I called back there to see if they were ready and from what I heard they were. It was not as clear as normal because of the wearing of the mask for COVID. We then closed the before takeoff checklist before departure and was cleared to takeoff. We then arrived at ZZZ1 with no issues. Then we landed and passengers deplaned; someone getting off the plane said something to me but was not able to hear being she was walking and far away with her mask on. Then the forward Flight Attendant came to the front and spoke to the Captain saying they had a passenger was not listening to the rules with the mask compliance. That's all I heard about. We then continued the rest of the trip. Then yesterday; we went ZZZ2 to ZZZ3 had 2 hrs between the next flight so then I went to go get food before everything closed. As I was going back to the gate the Captain told me we were removed from the rest of the pairing because of the other day that the flight attendants were not seated for departure. That was what I heard for the first time and was a little confused because the flight attendants never said anything to me after that flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 the day before.,,,,Air carrier First Officer reported taking off with the flight attendants not seated citing a possible misunderstanding because the FA was speaking through a protective mask.,"An incident occurred during a flight operated by an air carrier, involving a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant. The flight crew, consisting of the Captain and First Officer, was preparing for departure from ZZZ to ZZZ1 under challenging weather conditions, anticipating a quick taxi. They completed their preflight checks and communicated with the flight attendants, who closed and locked the flight deck door. The crew initiated engine start and taxi procedures, conducting a before-takeoff checklist. During this process, the flight crew attempted to confirm the flight attendants' readiness but received unclear responses due to mask usage, leading to a possible misunderstanding. The crew proceeded with takeoff, which was uneventful, and the flight landed safely. Upon deplaning, a flight attendant informed the Captain about a passenger's mask noncompliance. The flight crew continued their journey without further issues. However, the following day, the flight crew was informed of their removal from the rest of the pairing due to the flight attendants not being properly seated for departure the previous day. The First Officer was unaware of any such issue until the removal was communicated. The incident stemmed from a communication障碍 due to mask usage, leading to a misunderstanding about the flight attendants' readiness. As a result, the flight crew was removed from subsequent duties.",between attendant and crew

Lead FA (Purser) stated that none of the FAs were comfortable coming up to the Cockpit unless the remaining pilot (in the cockpit) wore a face covering. As he really needed to use the Lav; the FO consented to the FA's request and then told me (the Captain) of the FA's request. This is the first time in my XX+ years at airline and XY+ years as a Captain; that I've had a FA hold me hostage to get a Lav break. The FA requested that the pilot remaining in the cockpit wear a face covering in the cockpit while the other pilot was absent from the cockpit on the Lav break. I never wear a face covering in the cockpit; while flying the aircraft; especially with the other pilot absent from the cockpit.If it's not already obvious; let me restate that the FARs prohibit the use of a face covering (or the wearing of a beard) that would prevent a proper seal of the O2 mask. At FL400 and a TUC (Time of Useful Consciousness) of 15 seconds; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to find out that your O2 mask doesn't work with a face covering. As the FO left the cockpit; and me wearing a face covering; per the FA's request; ATC gave us a vector off course and a speed reduction for traffic. I replied to ATC; but they couldn't hear my boom mike through the face covering. At FL400; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to find out ATC can't hear your boom mike through the face covering. Before she left; I told the Lead FA that I would be writing a report and she said something through her face covering that I couldn't hear. At FL400; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to be unable to communicate with the only other person in the cockpit.Face coverings are UN-SAFE while taxing; flying; or maneuvering the airplane. They fog up my glasses which I am required to wear; they prevent me from communicating clearly with ATC; the other pilot or with the FA when the other pilot is absent from the cockpit.After the flight; we had a long debrief with the FAs. Company COVID-19 face covering information DOES NOT address the wearing of a face covering while operating an aircraft. The FAs on this flight; believed I was operating the aircraft in disregard of the Federal Aviation Regulations and in direct violation of Company Policy. It was unclear to these FAs; who gets to tell who must wear a face covering while operating an aircraft. None of these FAs seemed to understand who the Pilot-In-Command (PIC) is when operating an aircraft.In the masked de-brief; they were argumentative and confrontational. They thought that the remaining pilot on the cockpit was required to wear an O2 mask anytime the other pilot is absent the cockpit. It is very difficult to discuss face coverings with a FA who's been told that everyone is required to wear a face covering at all times while on an aircraft or on company property. The FAs do not understand the problems caused by face coverings in the cockpit (the O2 mask; Pilot to Pilot or Pilot to ATC communications issues; or Eye Glass fogging). The FAs believe that they can tell the Captain how to operate an aircraft in direct violation of the FARs; safety procedures and common sense. This has to stop. The Company must tell all employees; but especially FAs; that the Captain is in command; that face coverings cause safety issues in the cockpit and that pilots are NOT required (in fact; are discouraged from wearing) face coverings while operating an aircraft.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported that the flight attendants were not comfortable coming into the flight deck while the pilot was on a restroom break; until the remaining pilot was wearing a face mask. Reporter described safety concerns with having to wear a face mask in the cockpit.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and flight attendants regarding the safety protocols for wearing face coverings in the cockpit. Here's a concise summary: During the flight, the First Officer requested a Lavatory break. The Lead Flight Attendant insisted that no flight attendant would enter the cockpit unless the remaining pilot wore a face covering. The Captain complied but was angered, feeling it was unprecedented and unsafe. The Captain highlighted safety issues with face coverings in the cockpit, citing potential problems with oxygen masks, communication with ATC, and fogging of glasses. These concerns were particularly acute at FL400, where quick response times are critical. The use of a face covering muffled communication, leading to difficulties in contacting ATC and the Lead FA, further complicating the situation. Post-landing, the debrief with FAs became confrontational. FAs believed the Captain was violating safety protocols by not wearing a face covering and didn't understand the Captain's authority as PIC. The Captain emphasized the need for clear company policies on face coverings in the cockpit, noting that current COVID-19 guidelines don't address this specific scenario. They stressed the importance of recognizing the PIC's authority and the hazards face coverings pose in the cockpit environment. In conclusion, the incident underscored the need for improved communication, policy clarity, and understanding of safety protocols among all crew members.",between attendant and crew

FA A did not allow passengers to pass through the forward galley during boarding to expedite the boarding process. FA B tried his best to direct traffic at the 1L door. Due to FA A blocking traffic from coming through the forward galley passengers were only able to get to their seat using the aircraft left aisle until they reached the mid galley. This caused a delay for departure. We still had bags out and overhead bins open when the FA A made the PA that the boarding door had been closed; and to arm our doors. I ran forward and told her we were still getting bags put away; and still had open overhead bins. She stated the agent had closed the door. I stated that she should have told them we were not ready to close the boarding door. After that; all FAs armed doors and tried to get all bags and overhead bins taken care of as quickly as possible. We then felt ground movement. I looked out of the window. We had started moving backwards. We had not received an All Call; and we were still trying to get all bags stowed and overhead bins closed. I (FA C) grabbed the phone at my jumpseat and made an All Call. The FA A hung up the phone almost as soon as she answered. She simply stated her name. I stated my name and that I initiated an All Call since she had not and we were pushing back. Note that this also means she had closed the flight deck door. If the flight deck door was closed then the flight deck must have thought we were seated and stowed; when in fact we were not.

The conflict arose due to discrepancies in their communication and adherence to established procedures. FA A restricted passengers from using the forward galley during boarding, causing congestion and delays. FA B attempted to manage the boarding process at the 1L door but was hindered by FA A's actions, leading to a slower boarding procedure. After boarding was underway, FA A prematurely closed the boarding door and armed the doors without ensuring all bags and overhead bins were secured. When FA C, another flight attendant, attempted to address this by making an All Call, FA A hung up the phone and failed to complete the required COVID-19/mask announcement. FA A admitted to knowing that another flight attendant would have to make the announcement, as she was not going to do so. This resulted in confusion and a potentially hazardous situation, as the flight deck door was closed, creating the impression that the cabin was ready for takeoff when it was not. The incident concluded with FA A's alleged procedural violations and communication issues being brought to light, necessitating corrective action, such as addressing the FARs and procedures she may have violated. The situation created a chaotic and unsafe environment for both passengers and crew.",between attendant and crew

The Flight Attendant said she could not get any water to dispense from the sink. I made an assumption that the reservoir was empty; and that was the reason why it was not working. I made the decision to continue with the flight knowing that ZZZ did not have the capability to refill the reservoir. Thinking we could have it filled in ZZZ1. I was notified later in the day that the sink in that aircraft was inoperative and it had caused a delay on the aircraft's next flight.

My other FA moved the passenger in row XX up so we could move the mother and child towards the back; hoping to make other guests happy; and to avoid complaints about the child not wearing a mask. During compliance; child is still not wearing a mask. FA offers a cookie trying to convince the child to wear a mask. Mother of child informs us she screams and cries when she wears it. Asked Customer Service lead to give a final warning to mother. Was a very uncomfortable situation as we witnessed the mother begin to pull out her phone. Mother was very upset. FA and I tried our best to assure the mother that we realize these times are hard and confusing and we empathize with her for her situation as it was tough for all of us. They both seemed to be happy towards end of flight as we provided snack and beverages to ease the situation.I do not think we should enforce young children to wear masks. Child could possibly have disability and be unable to wear the mask. We are unaware of the family's situation and it is very hard to enforce grown adults to wear masks; let alone young children who don't understand what is going on.,,Passenger came onboard with X-year old child not wearing a mask. Gate agent tells me they were told to put it on and the child was screaming. I go to the back with a cookie and kindly ask if she can put her mask on and the mom tries to put it on and the child refuses. I asked if she is willing to sit in row XX so she wouldn't be near any of the other passengers. I moved passengers that were within 3 rows away from the mom and child. The mom looked stressed and her eyes were red. I know our policy is black and white regarding our process and removing a passenger. I felt like moving the passenger was the best thing to do; as I did not want this to turn into another public nightmare. I also asked if anybody felt uncomfortable with the small child taking the mask off at times while she is sitting far from everybody else and they all agreed it was OK. I told Captain the situation and they called a duty officer on their behalf to clear us to leave. The reason for making the exception made sense. She was at least 3 rows away from the nearest person; we avoided a meltdown; she was getting her camera ready and the bathroom in the back was inop so we knew nobody would go back there. I believe no further action was needed. We got guidance on the full procedure from our pilots and everyone was extremely grateful for a resolution to make everyone happy onboard.We need a better mask policy for children; especially if they might have a disability.,,Flight attendants reported that a child was unable to wear a face mask due to crying; resulting in a stressful situation.

Despite the gate agents informing the mother that the child needed to wear a mask, the child refused, and the mother was unable to comply due to the child's distress. The flight attendant attempted to resolve the situation by offering a cookie to the child and moving the mother and child to a different seat to minimize discomfort for other passengers. The mother, who appeared stressed and emotional, was empathized with by the flight attendant, who acknowledged the challenges of the situation. The flight attendant also questioned the enforceability of mask policies for young children, especially those who may have disabilities.

Plus it looked like it was a weave similar to what we used to wear as kids to cover our mouths and neck in the Midwest winters. Not a tight weave at all. I looked up the policy. It didn't say much about weave; so I went and apologized to him; only to have my head bit off more.This walking; talking while holding a cup of coffee is not actively drinking.

The DH Pilot complied with the mask policy only during takeoff, failing to cover his nose, and slumped during a walkthrough, making it unclear if he adhered to the policy. The NR Pilot delayed compliance until the aircraft was taxing. Both pilots used their activities as excuses, with the NR Pilot becoming upset when addressed by another crew member.

On (date) we were advised spraying had been done on aircraft and that he had done it prior to our boarding as the stairs were down next turn in ZZZ the overhead bins were closed when we boarded; so they apparently were not sprayed as they were dry but they told the Supervisor it was and we were told to board. We had been at gate the whole time and aircraft had been secured with stairs up.Today the FO and I were on aircraft when sprayer showed up to spray we observed him spray at first bins on only one side then it was a spray here and spray there missing most bins. We got off aircraft as he got closer to us. I was in jetbridge for flight before due to mask issue and overheard the FO ask the sprayer about the spray process and the sprayer insisted he did every bin. The FO walked back on the aircraft with the sprayer and checked overhead bins where some were wet and most dry. The sprayer at that time resprayed correctly. We then notified via company that tables had not been cleaned by anyone; however they had left the clean checklist which was actually put in jetbridge and signed off on before anyone had done anything on aircraft. 3 people were sent back to clean trays tables. One female went through cabin putting trays down in aisles. A male showed up with what appeared to be a wet rag and another females showed up with a wipe as well. I was finishing up that I mentioned earlier and when the cleaners got off the other FA came up and told me she watched them wipe the aisle trays but never lowered the trays in window seats and clean them. I checked a few trays and there was food and dirt still on some trays.As I am discussing this with pilots and we send another message via company the gate agent comes down and tells us to write a report on it and board. Instead we requested cleaners to come back as the cabin was not up to airlines standards and did not reflect what we tell passengers in our announcements. A supervisor showed up asked what happened we told him and showed him a couple of the tray tables. He left came back and cleaned them himself. All of this caused us to be delayed 30 mins which would never would have happened if they had just cleaned the airplane properly the first time.,,,,Flight Attendant reported cleaners did not sanitize the aircraft per company standards/policy.,"The incident involved a conflict between the Flight Crew (specifically the Flight Attendant) and Maintenance regarding the improper sanitization and cleaning of an aircraft. The Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft's overhead bins were not sprayed properly during the scheduled cleaning process at the ZZZ station, as they were dry despite being claimed as sanitized. During the flight, the Flight Attendant and First Officer (FO) observed the cleaner failing to sanitize most overhead bins, with some being resprayed only after being questioned. Additionally, the Flight Attendant noted that the cabin's tray tables were not properly cleaned, with evidence of food and dirt remaining. Despite sending cleaners back to address the issue, some tasks were incomplete, leading to a 30-minute delay in departure. A supervisor eventually cleaned the affected tray tables himself. The root cause of the delay was identified as the initial inadequate cleaning process, which could have been avoided with proper sanitization.

One woman was not responding to me; and I realized she could not hear me.  She said her ears were blocked from the last landing; and they had not cleared. Since she was unable to hear or respond to my questions; I told her I would have to re-seat her.  A gentleman in the exit row loudly said she was sick; and should not be allowed on the plane.  I asked her if she was sick; and she said no.  She appeared to be congested; which is likely the reason her ears blocked on landing.  I had her trade seats with another passenger; briefed the exit row and secured the forward cabin from the exit row forward.  When I got to the front; I informed A the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure.  I did not hear a PA that the aft cabin was secure. I informed the A that the woman I moved from the exit row could not hear; that she was congested but said she was not sick.  The A said she did not appear sick or have any COVID symptoms when she boarded. I said congestion could be a COVID symptom; and A seemed surprised; and said she never heard that.

A passenger in the exit row exhibited hearing difficulties, as she was unable to respond to the flight attendant's instructions. The passenger explained that her ears were blocked due to a prior landing, leading to congestion but not indicating that she was sick. The flight attendant attempted to reseat the passenger in accordance with safety protocols, but a gentleman seated nearby objected, claiming the passenger was sick and should not be on the plane. The passenger denied being sick, though her congestion raised concerns about potential COVID-19 symptoms. The flight attendant consulted with the captain and operations, who advised her that if the passenger was not explicitly sick or exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, she could remain on the plane. The flight attendant proceeded with reseating the passenger and securing the forward cabin. The incident was resolved after the flight attendant successfully completed the seat change and informed the captain that the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure.

I told ops which in turned called for a Supervisor. The Supervisor came and I asked how long does it take to clean seats and trays. He said there is no time frame. I told him this employee wasn't on the plane 5 minutes. He asked if I wanted another cleaning crew to come. I said no; I just want to know he did ALL trays.

After a flight from ZZZ1 with XX passengers and one jump seat, the cleaner finished in just 5 minutes. The Flight Attendant, occupied with a customer, reported this to Operations, who contacted a Supervisor. She inquired about the appropriate cleaning time, learning there was no established time frame. She emphasized the importance of maintaining customer expectations by ensuring all trays were cleaned properly, as the cleaners didn't know where passengers had sat.

All crewmembers ascertained that they were. On the second day of our pairing we as a crew made sure that we were fit for duty. Unbeknownst to me at the time; our Flight Attendant was disguising and working through some illness. I later discovered (following our trip) that she informed the [other] Flight Attendant of back pain; weakness; headaches; and nausea. She did not make these conditions known to me or the First Officer and continued working throughout the two day pairing. Following our trip I personally came down with chest congestion and a cough. The day after my trip I was notified by the Flight Attendant that she tested positive for COVID-19. I asked if the FA contacted the company and told her to feel better. I was off duty; but felt obligated to inform my First Officer and other Flight Attendant. According to the FA; she saw a doctor before the trip because she was feeling ill; but she was misdiagnosed with a sinus infection. Yet; she still flew with the supposed sinus infection; which turned out to be COVID-19.Lack of communication and transparency from the FA about her preexisting health condition led to the compromised safety of passengers and fellow flight crew. If unfit for duty; do not show up for work and compromise the health of aircrew/passengers/partners by disregarding the safety protocols and applicable FAR's that outline crew-member responsibilities.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported becoming ill after working on a trip with a sick Flight Attendant who did not inform all crew members that she was feeling sick and then later tested positive for COVID-19.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant who worked despite being unwell, having symptoms like back pain, weakness, headaches, and nausea, which were later diagnosed as COVID-19. The Flight Attendant failed to inform the Pilot in Command (PIC) and the First Officer about her condition, leading to her working while sick. As a result, the PIC became ill with chest congestion and a cough after the trip. The Flight Attendant had been misdiagnosed with a sinus infection before the trip. The PIC emphasized the need for crew members to communicate any health issues and not work if unfit, to prevent compromising safety protocols and crew health.

He came very close to me and my jumpseat; and I quickly asked if he wouldn't mind taking a step back; and thanks. I asked him also to please wear his face/nose covering. He replied that he did not have one. I began to feel very uncomfortable as he was having trouble keeping his distance while also not having a face covering on. I told him if you can go get your face covering at your seat; we'd all really appreciate it and I'll get your waters and snacks ready in the meantime. He said again he did not have one. I told him that we will provide one for you no problem. So I had Flight Attendant (FA) A go and grab one for him and he slowly and reluctantly put it on. He started saying that it doesn't make sense that he was allowed to board without one. I specifically recalled him wearing one before and during taxiing out.He stood in the back galley and was now complying with wearing the mask and I gave him some waters and snacks. He asked for my name and badge number to file a complaint. I told him that this isn't anything personal or something to argue about; it's just our company's policy to wear a face covering and it's something that not only makes me feel comfortable but all the people around you. I also gave him my first name and the flight number. He started to tell me in an argumentative way that it is how I said for him to put his face mask on that was rude especially with asking him to take a step back when he wasn't wearing one at all. I told him that I had nicely asked him and now you're wearing one that we provided; thanks. He explained further that he thinks that I'm 'one of those people on the left.' I simply explained to him that I don't want to argue about this as this is simply just a policy that everyone on board must comply with; that's it! He tried to keep arguing with me and I replied that I'm not here to argue about this; or what I was asking you to do; I'm just grateful that you're now wearing your mask; so thank you. He kept insisting that the crew today is terrible and that he wants to file a complaint. He also kept mentioning that he wasn't wearing one during boarding. Something felt a little off about him; I kept insisting that this is our policy and that we appreciate his compliance. No warning was necessary because the guest complied with wearing the mask from the point when I provided one.The guest claimed he was not wearing a face mask when boarding; even though I recall seeing him wear one.

The attendant requested the passenger to step back and wear a mask, citing company policy. The passenger responded by stating he didn't have a mask and expressed discomfort. The attendant had another crew member fetch a mask, which the passenger reluctantly put on. The passenger then argued that the request was rude and claimed he wasn't wearing a mask during boarding, despite the attendant's recollection of him doing so. The passenger requested the attendant's details to file a complaint, accusing her of being partisan.

He started to get a little [bit] of an attitude and said something about our policy. At that point I found a way to end the conversation because it was going nowhere. Then I went and explained it to the A Flight Attendant.We both believed giving him a warning would cause a bigger scene and we only have about 40 minutes flight time left. So far no one has complained about him; but if someone does we will have to issue the warning at that point.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger resisted adhering to face mask policy. No further action was taken for fear of escalating the situation.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant noticed a passenger, identified as Passenger in XX2, not wearing a face mask during the flight. The attendant approached the passenger, who was asleep, and attempted to enforce the face mask policy. The passenger responded by explaining that he had recently undergone surgery on his nose for cancer and that wearing a mask caused him pain. Despite the attendant's apologies and attempts to explain the policy, the passenger became increasingly argumentative. Recognizing that the situation was escalating and could potentially lead to further conflict, the attendant decided to discontinue the conversation. The attendant then informed another flight attendant, A, about the situation. Together, they concluded that issuing a warning to the passenger might escalate the situation further, especially since there were only 40 minutes of flight time remaining.

The male passenger was talking on his phone; wearing his mask around his neck; when asked to put his mask he replied he was claustrophobic and could not wear his mask.  I informed him it was mandatory to wear the mask and if he was not able to comply with safety instructions that it would be addressed at that time not during the flight.  He cursed at me; at that time his female traveling companion told him to stop and to listen.  She said he would comply with crew member instructions.  I had to stop twice during the safety demonstration to tell him to put on mask and stop using his cell phone; he was [on] a phone call.FA D's jumpseat was directly in front of row YY and XX exit row. Upon FA taking his jumpseat for takeoff the passenger in seat XX1 was not wearing his mask; took off his shoes and had his duffle bag right at his feet.  FA D came to back to tell me what he was doing and that FA D was afraid to say anything to this passenger because he felt threatened by him and feared that this passenger would become violent with him.  At that point FA D called the Captain and told him everything that happen since this passenger came on board the flight.  FA D requested the Captain to remove this passenger from the fight.  However; the Captain came on the PA made an announcement to all the passengers that there was a passenger on board that was not complying with crew instructions and for the passenger to comply with airline instructions right away [or] that he would be going back to the gate.

I also stocked the cockpit with a 6 pack of water and continued to do my security checks. C Flight Attendant arrived a little later and we chatted catching up since we last worked together. Shortly thereafter; B Flight Attendant arrived. B Flight Attendant and I started chatting and catching up since we had not worked together since 2019. Toward the end of B Flight Attendant and my conversation with C Flight Attendant present; I stated; 'These are crazy times since COVID. C Flight Attendant and I have recently worked together. So that we can better protect each other and social distance as much as possible; B Flight Attendant and I can do the water service. You (B Flight Attendant) can serve from the back and I can serve from the front and that we can meet somewhere in the middle of the cabin. C Flight Attendant can pass out the snacks. We all can take turns making trash runs individually. You and I can also pass out the paperwork the same way. You can distribute paperwork starting from the back of the cabin and I will start from the front of the cabin and we will meet somewhere in the middle of the cabin.' We all agreed.C Flight Attendant and B Flight Attendant continued to chat and I continued setting up and arranging my workspace in the forward galley.  As I was kneeling checking my compartment in the forward bulkhead; the First Officer walked onto the aircraft.  As he was making his greeting of 'Hello; I'm FO [name];' I responded 'Hello; I'm (A Flight Attendant)' as I raised up to greet him. As I stood up; [the] FO and I were face to face and I was startled that he was not wearing a mask. I immediately asked while stepping back creating social distance; 'Where's your mask?' FO responded; 'Where's my mask?' I repeated; 'Yes; where is your mask. We all need to wear our mask to help prevent the spread of the Coronavirus and to keep each other and their families safe.' [The] FO reached into his pocket and pulled his face mask out of it. He then rolled his bags into the cockpit with his mask in his hand. I then pushed up the cockpit door as I completed my rev napkin and completed the security document.Shortly after [the] FO got settled in the cockpit; he came out back into the cabin; but wearing his mask this time. He then said; 'Do you feel safer now that I am wearing the mask?' I responded; 'Absolutely. Thank You.' He then walked further into the cabin where C Flight Attendant and B Flight Attendant were standing between the bulkhead and row X talking. [The] FO was standing with his back against the bulkhead on the Captain side of the cabin/leaning into the aisle and B Flight Attendant was in the center of the aisle between row 1 and 2; C Flight Attendant was standing in front of row X in front of the bulkhead leaning toward the aisle. The Operations agent came and informed me of the specials and that boarding would be starting [soon]. I then went to retrieve gloves from the bulkhead compartment when I noticed that B Flight Attendant was no longer wearing her mask. She had her mask in her right hand. FO did not have his mask on properly. FO's mask was dangling by one strap on his right ear hanging down the right side of his face. Both of their noses and mouths were completely exposed as they were engaging in conversations. I then stated; 'Guys; we are about to start boarding and we are crew and it is very important that we all wear our masks over our nose and mouths while we are on the aircraft for our safety as well as the passengers who will be here shortly.' B Flight Attendant just stared at me. No one attempted to put their masks on immediately. I then repeated; 'Can I have both of you put your masks on to help the efforts of reducing the spread of COVID?' B Flight Attendant rolled her eyes at me and put her mask on covering her nose and mouth and started to walk down the aisle. FO then put on his maskand started walking back the main entrance area where I was standing.I then initiated the high-low chime to initiate that boarding would be starting shortly. FO says; as he is looking in the mirror adjusting his mask; 'Does this thing make you feel safer?' I said; 'Definitely. The masks when worn properly and with social distancing and good hand hygiene slows the spread of COVID.' FO says sarcastically; 'What is COVID?' I responded;' Everyone in the U.S. knows what COVID is since we have been dealing with it since March/April.' FO says; 'Well; I have never heard of it.' I said; 'It is a worldwide Pandemic therefore; you and everyone else has heard of it and knows exactly what it is for certain. The CDC; NIH; WHO; and the company have set guidelines stating that we all must wear mask on the planes. This should be second nature for all of us since most states have a mask mandate for public places since March/April.' We started boarding. The Captain came on the aircraft. He introduced himself and asked how things were going. I said; 'Hi! I'm (A Flight Attendant). Everything is okay except; the FO came on the aircraft without a mask and he was condescending; sarcastic; responding to me. He said; 'I wasn't here for that. I'm sorry that happened.  With the exception to the mask situation is everything okay. I said; 'Yes.' He gave me the pre-flight briefing to pass to the other Flight Attendants. He went into the cockpit. Boarding continued.In between the lag in the boarding process; B Flight Attendant comes up front from her boarding position in the back. She then opens the cockpit door (that I have pushed up as a protection since the pilots are not masked on the flight deck) and enters the cockpit and closed the door behind her. I continued to stay in my boarding position and continued the boarding process.  After about 5-7 minutes B Flight Attendant came out of the cockpit and went back to her boarding position. We continued the boarding process. I had completed the Opening PA and secured the cabin. (C Flight Attendant) came up front to tell me that the overwing was briefed. Captain then comes out of the cockpit and asked C-FA and I if everything was okay. C-FA and I responded; 'Yes.'Captain then went the back galley and talked to (B Flight Attendant) for a few minutes. During this time; I started to feel that the conversations that (B Flight Attendant) had when she entered the cockpit and their current conversation; I am the subject of discussion. So; when the Captain came back to the front of the plane I motioned for him to join me in the jetbridge to give him my version of events of (B Flight Attendant) and FO being annoyed with me for asking them to wear their masks on the plane. Since the passengers were on the plane; Captain and I stepped into the jetbridge. I told the Captain that I had asked (B Flight Attendant) and FO to put on their mask in effort to prevent or slow the spread of COVID. I told him that B Flight Attendant rolled her eyes at me and FO responded very sarcastically and condescendingly antagonizing me with a lengthy conversation regarding the mask. I did not ask anything of them outside of established protocols and guidelines established by the company; the State; and the CDC. The masks are a necessary piece of PPE that is necessary to prevent or slow the spread of COVID.'The Captain then said; 'I just need to know if you are going to be comfortable working with your crew on the plane.' I was startled and confused. I said. 'I'm sorry; I am not understanding your line of questioning.' He said; 'I don't know if you are comfortable working in a small space that is not going to give you 6 feet of space between you and your crew.' I said; 'I am talking to you about the mask policy and you are talking about social distancing. Then it dawned on me that B Flight Attendant must have said something to him about our social distancing conversation. He then repeated; 'I don't know if you are comfortable working in a small space that is not going to give you 6 feet of space between you and your crew.' I then said; 'WHOA; don't put words in my mouth. I never said anything about 6 feet of distancing to you or anyone else. There is ABSOLUTELY no way you can do our jobs with 6 feet of separation that is absurd and totally unrealistic. The passengers with the middle empty seat doesn't even have 6 feet between them. The C Flight Attendant sitting on row X is not 6 feet from the X jumpseat. When you briefed me earlier you were far less than 6 feet from me and I had no issues with distance. At this very moment that we are talking you are far less than 6 feet from me and I am fine; therefore; I think you know the answer to your question. If you need me to verbally say it; then I am fine being less than 6 feet from my crew and passengers.' He then said; 'With everything that you have on it is hard to believe that.' I said; 'I am wearing my mask and gloves which the company has approved as acceptable PPE for COVID when working; therefore I do not understand why it's concerning to you as an indication that I am uncomfortable being less than 6 feet from the passengers and my crew. We all should be using reasonable social distancing; PPE; and best hygiene practices collectively to prevent or slow the spread of COVID. I am just asking that protocol is being followed regarding my crew and passengers wearing face masks.'He then asked; 'Well is it protocol to close the cockpit door during boarding? I said; 'I never closed the door. The door was ajar with the latch/lock extended to prevent closing because you all (Captain and FO) did not have on mask on the flight deck and I had to remain in my boarding position that would put me in grave risk of potential COVID exposure or contracting COVID. My masks and PPE that I am wearing protects you and your family. If you and FO are in the cockpit without mask; there is nothing to protect me and my family since I must stand there for 30 minutes or longer. I used the ajar door as a protective shield for me from a potential COVID infection.' He said; 'You did not ask me.' I said; 'Sir; we obviously are having miscommunication; because you did not tell me that it bothered you.' He said; 'We do not have to wear masks when we are in the cockpit and when you close the door I can't hear the FO do the checks.' I said; 'That's a first. Most of the pilots close to door to hear better in the cockpit; but if you don't want the door ajar; then I won't do that. Will you at least wear the mask when the cockpit door is open to help protect me and my family from potentially contracting COVID since a lot of us may be asymptomatic spreaders?' He said; 'So you are asking us to wear a mask in the flight deck even though that is not our protocol?' I said; 'Sir; I am wearing my PPE and the passengers are wearing their PPE to protect others including you; therefore; I am asking you to wear PPE anytime you are on the plane where COVID could be potentially spread to me and others.' He said; 'Let me get this right. You want us to wear mask in the cockpit even though that is not our protocol.' I said; 'Sir; I am asking you to reciprocate the protections that I am affording you and your family by wearing my PPE properly. I am just asking for you to wear the mask to protect me and my family. How is it that we require passengers to do what we as crew are not willing to do? I have to stand in my boarding position which would be gross negligence since I would be in the path of a potential COVID exposure with no protections if you and the FO do not wear the mask with the door open. No problem. I am not willing to expose myself and my family to that level of risk. That level of consequence should not be required or expected of me while doing my job. I will have to just stand on the outside of the aircraft in front of the entrance and greet the passengers who will be wearing masks during boarding and deplaning.'He then asked; 'If,,,,Flight Attendant reported having a disagreement with the Captain and First Officer regarding their compliance with wearing face masks.,"The incident occurred when Flight Attendant A encountered non-compliance with mask policies and sarcastic remarks from the First Officer (FO) regarding COVID protocols. A addressed the FO's lack of a mask and emphasized the importance of masks as PPE. During boarding, A noticed both the FO and another flight attendant, B, were not wearing their masks properly and requested they comply. The FO made sarcastic comments about COVID, leading to a confrontation. A later discussed her concerns with the Captain, who expressed worries about her comfort working with the crew. A explained that social distancing was impractical and stressed the need for masks to protect everyone. The Captain questioned the necessity of masks in the cockpit, prompting A to suggest that the crew should wear masks when the door was open for mutual protection. The situation highlighted the need for consistent compliance with safety protocols and respectful communication among crew members.",between attendant and crew

This communication breakdown led to a delay in providing an aisle chair for a connecting passenger, causing three passengers to remain on the aircraft longer than expected. The flight attendant expressed regret for the delay and suggested that ensuring access to jet bridge phone numbers could prevent future issues. To address the communication challenges, it was recommended that every flight be equipped with jet bridge phone numbers to facilitate timely communication with ground agents, thereby improving customer service and ensuring timely passenger deplaning.",between attendant and crew

Captain said their manual says they are permitted.Please clarify discrepancies.,,During boarding; FA1 and FA4 monitored  bulkhead for items on the floor.  The hover board was not there during checks.  On taxi out; during demonstration; the board was observed.  Cabin crew notified Captain.  FA's and Flight Crew checked manuals for acceptance.  In flight attendant manual; two sections were checked. Personal PED's and hazardous materials.  The first said not allowed.  The second said allowed with limitations.   Limitations had to do with the grams of lithium-ion batteries.  Could not find  reference to the acceptable grams.  Flight crew said their manuals said the amount in hover board was acceptable .Have a notification on boarding pass that says bulkhead so the agent can brief at gate and require a briefing by flight attendants  and notifying purser before aircraft door closure.

The passenger had a hoverboard in a box that was initially unnoticed during boarding but was observed during taxi-out. The FA reported this to the Captain, who permitted it if the lithium battery was under 50 grams, citing their manual. However, the FA referenced their manual, which prohibited PMDs (Personal Mobility Devices) as carry-on or checked baggage. The manual was found to have conflicting sections: one prohibiting PMDs and another allowing them with battery limitations, which were unclear regarding exact gram limits. The flight crew believed their manual permitted the hoverboard's battery. To resolve the issue, they proposed aligning FA and flight crew manuals to avoid confusion, adding boarding pass notifications for bulkhead passengers to brief at the gate, and enhancing the FA manual's specificity on PMD definitions under hazardous materials. The key cause was manual discrepancies, with proposed solutions to improve clarity and procedures.",between attendant and crew

They said something to me about it after my break along the lines that she was upset and combative. I was surprised; as I wore my mask (a KN95 on the ground and a solid multi-layer cloth one in the air) all times outside of the flight deck and in the flight deck if a Flight Attendant was present.  Additionally; the other First Officer did as well. The Captain wears glasses that fog easily with a mask on. He wore a mask on the ground; he did not airborne because it would greatly interfere with his duties both because he wouldn't be able to see and could not communicate. This was our 4th leg together and we had no issues with masks among ourselves or other flight attendants.  Additionally; both the Captain and other First Officer already had COVID which they had gotten from people they knew at home; not in the workplace. Before our next rest room break I got out a new unused N95 mask for the Flight Attendant that would be in the flight deck while I was in the bathroom. When I called back and ask for the break she ordered me that the pilot remaining in the flight deck should wear the crew oxygen mask.  I said that was not something that we did anymore-the practice stopped months ago because of COVID.   I offered her the N95 for extra protection because the Captain can't wear a mask and do his job.  She refused it.  Instead continuing to wear what appeared to be a single layer stretchy black cloth mask. Additionally the flight attendant blocking the cart was wearing a KN95 but the Lead FA did not send her into the flight deck. I found the flight attendant to not be willing to exercise self-help and any wearing of an N95 and apparent multiple complaints to be a distraction from my flight duties. This was not good for crew CRM. While the single pilot on the flight deck; I was distracted from monitoring the airplane by her distress and complaints.,,,,Air Carrier First Officer reported poor CRM with the Lead FA regarding the company face mask policy on the Flight Deck.,"The incident arose from a disagreement between the Lead Flight Attendant and another Flight Attendant regarding the company's face mask policy on the flight deck. The Lead Flight Attendant offered an N95 mask as an extra precaution, given the Captain's difficulty in wearing a mask while fulfilling his duties. This offer was refused, with the flight attendant continuing to wear a single-layer cloth mask. This refusal led to the flight attendant's distress and complaints, which distracted from crew coordination and resulted in a reported issue with CRM (Crew Resource Management). The Lead Flight Attendant's attempt to mitigate the situation by providing additional protection was met with resistance, highlighting a compliance concern with the established mask policy.",between attendant and crew

He further alleged that I knew about this prior to takeoff. I responded that I was not aware of any such issue; and would not have departed had I known. He said he had cell phone video and observed the aft FA (Flight Attendant) make a interphone call to the cockpit. Noting this was a serious safety issue. I concurred with him that if this occurred it was indeed a safety issue and that I would investigate and report as required; but I had not received an interphone call from the FA. He reiterated the cell phone video and stated his intent to submit it to [the company] and the FAA. He provided no further details; nor showed me the video; and departed. As background; the flight was operating about 5 hours late due to aircraft non-availability. Once we had an aircraft; we boarded and waited another 25 mins or so for a replacement FO (First Officer) as the original FO was now projected illegal. The new FO was a [distantly-based] new hire; but this had little if any impact on the flight. On taxi out we stopped for about 20 minutes in the west hard stand to receive a complete weather reroute from ATC; reentered the new route; got approval from dispatch to operate on the new route; changed runways and departures; briefed and accomplished flows and checklist. We had 4 minutes to make our [Departure Time]. I immediately made the 'FA prepare for Takeoff PA'; cleared to line up and wait by ATC; cycled the seat belt chime to alert FAs we were taking the runway; sat for 15-20 seconds and were cleared for takeoff. Uneventful flight to ZZZ till passenger approached me (FO was already gone) at gate in ZZZ. All of this delay information just indicates that passengers; especially a small child; might well have needed to use the lavatory. So I did query the Flt Attendants about this incident. The aft FA did make an interphone call to the #1 FA; following his chain of command; to advise that a father had taken his son into the restroom. The #1 FA told me he did not contact us on the Flt Deck because we had 'already started rolling for takeoff' and he was concerned about violating the sterile cockpit in a critical phase of flight. He made a quick decision that overall safety was better served by not contacting us. Clearly taking off with anyone in the lavatory is unsafe and against [company] SOPs. Unclear to me in this event is exactly when the father and child entered the lavatory. If during the hold short or line up and wait (15-20 secs) phase; a call could be appropriate to the cockpit to alert us of the situation. We could decline the takeoff clearance and clear the runway as needed. If in fact we were accelerating (rolling?) for takeoff; the passengers' safety may be more compromised by the rapid deceleration of a rejected takeoff. The FA's situational awareness is limited to our departure PA; and taking the runway chime followed by aircraft movement and engine noise. This limited input could affect their decision making process as to where we are in the takeoff maneuver.Secondly; I'm concerned about communication. I brief the #1 FA on every flight; I believe this to be important since we now fly with many different crews; from many different bases; frequently different on every leg. I did so on this flight to relay details of the flight and to open up communication. Still no one called to advise us of this event during the entire flight. I only learned about it from the concerned passenger at the arrival gate. Kind of blindsided. Not even the father in the lavatory said anything. Of note there were 10 uniformed crew members on the flight who said nothing when departing; though they may not have been in a position to observe anything. Bottom line is passenger safety is paramount; I believeunless we're on high speed takeoff roll; we could have handled a reject safely if notified. Perhaps a more assertive approach by the FA would have prevented this event from progressing to a takeoff with passengers not in their seats.,,,,A321 Captain reported being informed after landing of passenger using lavatory during previous takeoff roll.,"A passenger reported to the flight captain that a father and small boy were in the lavatory during takeoff. The passenger provided a cell phone video showing an interphone call made by a flight attendant to another crew member, who then did not contact the cockpit to avoid violating sterile cockpit rules during a critical phase. The flight experienced multiple delays, including aircraft unavailability and weather reroutes, leading to a near-miss of the departure time. The flight attendant involved made an interphone call but did not inform the cockpit, leaving the captain unaware of the situation until post-landing. The captain expressed safety concerns, emphasizing the importance of timely communication during takeoffs to allow for safe aborted takeoffs if necessary. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication protocols, especially with diverse crews, to prevent similar occurrences and ensure passenger safety.",between attendant and crew

This briefing; initiated since FA2 and FA3 are also do not feel safe; neither comfortable with FA4 since we were unclear that she is being lazy or do not know her duties.  I am attempted to set the tone for this flight.  FA4 has never performed a pre-flight check; but we did it.  I have asked FA4 to perform 15 mins walk-thru.  Later FA4 complains FA1 (myself) is too strict; she does not think she should take it seriously.  But FA2 advised her to take it seriously but do not take it personally.  Never closed overhead bin after I made an announcement of 'Boarding complete; flight attendant secure cabin for departure.'  Those attitudes become a burden on FA3 during boarding.  The situation was getting close to door closure; regarding exit row briefing; it must be conducted before door closure.  I had to call FA2 to do the exit row briefing and OHB closure to do boarding duties.  FA4 has not performed for compliance check during the flight when the seatbelt sign is illuminated but performed by us as an FA1; FA2; FA3.  FA4 does not answer customer call light even though I told her to get one of them.,,,,FA1 reported that FA4 could not perform duties without additional direction.,"The incident involved a conflict between two flight attendants (FA1 and FA4) during a pre-flight briefing and subsequent flight duties. FA1 conducted the briefing, which included reviewing in-flight procedures and addressing safety protocols. During the briefing, FA1 noticed that FA2 and FA3 were uncomfortable with FA4's performance, as her attitude and lack of initiative raised concerns about her ability to fulfill her duties without additional direction. FA1 attempted to set a professional tone for the flight but encountered resistance when FA4 failed to comply with directives, such as conducting a pre-flight check, closing overhead bins, and responding to customer call lights. FA1 reported that FA4's inability to perform her duties without direct supervision created a burden on the cabin crew, ultimately requiring other flight attendants to compensate for her lack of compliance. The situation was resolved when FA2 assumed additional responsibilities during boarding and the flight. No specific solution was proposed in the context provided.",between attendant and crew

She said; 'I know this airplane.'  However; there are a few issues noted.  One; no pre-flight check has accomplished but sat down the last row and using a personal cellphone.  FAR 121.309 violation.  Remind herself to do it.  I checked instead.  Second; during all call; she did not know how to use the interphone. Had to ask FA2 to verify with FA4; the customer talked to me it was a concern if she knows what she is doing when I walked-thru the aisle during flight.  Third; when a customer had an issue with FA4 during boarding; FA4 told us the customer said to her 'Damn ass;' we solved a problem with MOD and the agent on the ground to make sure FA4 is ok.  However; after this event; FA4 was on her cellphone; texting on her jump seat while still boarding when I approached her.  Even though I told her not to do so but she continued.  Fourth; during the flight; no 15mins walk-thru; compliance checked when the seatbelt sign is illuminated; no response to customers call light. Those are accomplished but FA1; FA2; FA3 were the only crew have performed the in flight duty. Lastly; this is going to be other report that she was in sleep on the jump seat during the flight; complained about how tired she is.  Reported by FA2; FA3 was offering coffee or something to help; but she refused since she does not drink coffee.  Then shut the curtain.  The curtain opened by FA2 to accommodate other customers.  The last leg; I initiated crew briefing for the special information for our customers; flight-time; a reminder of pre-flight check emergency equipment check; in flight duties; compliance check; etc. FA4 has responded to FA2 FA1 is too strict.  When FA4 was based in New York; those never cared and she told FA2 that she does not need to take it seriously.  FA2; FA3 reported to me that this is not good.  We all do not feel safe to fly with her.  FA4 has also verbalized the eccentric phrase that she wants to create disease to kill people who ruin the environment.

These included non-compliance with pre-flight checks as per FAR 121.309, failure to use the interphone correctly, texting on her phone during boarding despite being instructed otherwise, and not responding to call lights during the flight. Additionally, FA4 was observed sleeping on her jump seat and expressed hostile remarks. FA1, along with FA2 and FA3, felt unsafe working with FA4 and reported their concerns to management.

After speaking with the PAX (Passenger) she informed me that she had a highly contagious disease. After speaking with her; She explained that her illness wasn't airborne but someone could contract it if they touched anything she'd touched. I asked her for her name. Although; it was turbulent and we were on final descent; I contacted the cockpit they were informed of what was going on. I was told he couldn't talk at that time but did I need me Paramedics to meet us at the gate. I asked him to have a Supervisor meet the plane. The PAX was not in distress and showed no signs of needing immediate medical attention; therefore I didn't call for medical assistance. Once at the gate pure chaos erupted. Ops quickly opened the door allowed me to get off the plane then close and locked the jet bridge door which prohibited anyone from deplaning. I was trying to explain what was going on; meanwhile the Captain was trying to get into the jet bridge. I had to open the the door for him. Then I was told to make an announcement telling the PAX not to deplane. I checked on the UM (Unaccompanied Minor) and make sure he understood that he was okay. There were several Supervisors present. I was simultaneously speaking to them and Inflight. We had to wait for clearance to allow PAX off the plane. Together with Ops and Supervisors gathered all the facts so that they could inform the UM's parent's of the possible exposure. I was trying to keep the PAX that was in that same row with the ill PAX and the UM from deplaning as requested by the Supervisors. Pax were cleared to deplane; Supervisor took care of the UM and the PAX in that row deplaned with me getting her information. After everyone deplaned; I helped the ill PAX off the aircraft. I returned to the plane and cleaned the row with our onboard disinfectant. After that; I was talking to the Inflight SUP; trying to help a crew change; speaking with the Captain; updating my crew; and telling the outbound crew they could come down the jet way and board the aircraft. I did not get all the ill PAX information to put in my IR.Once we landed the pilots could have called us back and clarify what was going on. I feel if that would have happened; ground ops would not have went into lock down. Collectively we could have came up with a plan. Everyone plays a vital role but sometimes if we are not flying the plane we are made to feel less than for lack of a better word. I could only communicate the information I was given . We were in final descent but once we landed I did not feel comfortable contacting the cockpit. Once we landed the Captain never tried to contact us to clarify what was going on; which created a problem once we got to the gate and he was locked in. It was only at that time that he wanted know what was going on.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant in Charge reported a communications breakdown between Flight Attendant and flight crew shortly after being notified of a passenger with a 'highly contagious disease'.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between a flight attendant and the flight crew of a B737 aircraft, triggered by the presence of a passenger with a highly contagious disease. The flight attendant was informed by another crew member about the passenger, who had pre-boarded and requested that her seat be cleaned with Clorox after deplaning. Upon speaking with the passenger, the flight attendant learned that the individual had a contagious illness, which could be transmitted through contact but was not airborne. Despite the turbulence and being on final descent, the flight attendant contacted the cockpit, informing them of the situation. The cockpit, occupied by the captain, was unable to communicate at that time but was advised to have a supervisor meet the plane at the gate. The passenger was not in distress and did not require immediate medical attention, so the flight attendant did not call for emergency services. Upon landing, chaos erupted at the gate. Operations staff opened the door, allowing the flight attendant to deplane, but then locked the jet bridge, preventing other passengers from exiting. The captain attempted to enter the jet bridge, and the flight attendant was forced to open the door for him. The flight attendant was instructed to make an announcement asking passengers to remain on the plane, while supervisors gathered to collect information and inform the parents of an unaccompanied minor (UM) about potential exposure. The flight attendant worked to prevent the UM and other passengers in the affected row from deplaning, as requested by supervisors. Once cleared, passengers, including the UM, were allowed to exit, with the flight attendant collecting the ill passenger's information. After everyone had deplaned, the flight attendant assisted the ill passenger off the aircraft, cleaned the affected row with onboard disinfectant, and continued her duties, including coordinating with the inflight supervisor, the captain, and the outbound crew. The incident highlighted a breakdown in communication post-landing, as the captain did not contact the cabin crew to clarify the situation, leading to confusion and the subsequent lockdown. The flight attendant expressed frustration with the lack of communication and the resulting delays, suggesting that a coordinated approach could have been achieved if the captain had communicated with the cabin crew after landing. The proposed solution was for the captain to contact the cabin crew post-landing to avoid the lockdown and develop a unified plan. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of clear communication and collaboration among all crew members, regardless of their role.",between attendant and crew

The Captain was already there; we said hello; [and] I did my walk around then started my preflight duties. As we were boarding; we were having the standard (where are you from) conversation. Captain told me he lives out of base and is relatively new to ZZZ. He then said he was actually thinking about changing bases soon because he can't take the attitudes of ZZZ First Officer's. Personally; I have been a ZZZ First Officer for 5 years and have never heard of a problem. Being concerned; I asked what's been going on. He never really gave me an example; but he basically said that these First Officers have a problem with challenging the Captain. Then he said that he is sure that we won't have that issue on this trip because I don't seem like that type of guy. Then he continued and told me that if I do want to play the game of who knows more; that he promises that it won't end well for me. I assured him that I don't play those games and I only speak up if it's a safety issue or I feel it necessary. And that was about the extent of my briefing from the Captain. I thought it was odd that at this day and age; my briefing was basically 'don't challenge the Captain'. I then told him that he can't hurt my feelings and to please speak up if he sees me making a mistake.At this time; Maintenance comes into the flight deck to tell us a tire that was questionable was well within their limits and that we were good to go. Maintenance questioned what guidance we had and we explained our guidance is much different than theirs; usually more conservative. I gave the mechanic the example of the hydraulic fluid quantities and their 'normal fill' range. The book states if it is at all outside of those limits; even for thermal expansion; that we are required to call Maintenance. The Captain then spoke up and said that wasn't true as they've added a note saying that as long as we don't have any ECAMs that we don't have to call Maintenance. I was surprised he said that and asked when it changed. He said it changed a long time ago; probably 6 months ago. I said that I must have missed the change and we moved on. During the taxi; we had a crosswind that was technically a 1 knot tailwind. I said ok no problem; TOGA take off and I'll go to the TPS and work the number. Captain told me not to use the TPS but to just request a new TPS using 'request T.O. Data' and put the tailwind in there. I said that doesn't work. You can compute the tailwind penalty manually or call and have a new TPS sent with the tailwind penalty added. He said 'oh really; well you're the only First Officer that seems to think that'. He then continued and told me that about 30 of his last First Officer's requested a new TPS with the tailwind. I said that I found that odd because they make it every clear in training that you cannot do this. I asked if I could just do this manually for now and we could talk about the tailwind and the TPS during our flight to ZZZ1. He agreed. As I was heads down doing the penalty; the Captain was swerving down the taxiway because he was also heads down doing the same thing. I said I'll take care of this so you can taxi. He said no it's ok; I'm good at taxiing. So a short time later; I said ok we have a TOGA take off and our penalty is 970 LBS. off MTOW. He said; not its 1;050 [LBS]. I said ok maybe I looked at it wrong. I looked again and it was in fact 970 lbs. He looked again and agreed as he saw his mistake. We were legal to take off. Once we were on our way and not busy with ZZZ; I looked up the note about the normal fill for the hydraulics. I read the note and it still says we are required to call Maintenance. I showed the Captain. He read it and was surprised that it said what it said and that he must have missed the last sentence. We moved on and I said let's look at the TPS. I said that; like the hydraulic issue; I'm looking this up for my own personal knowledge. Things change all the time and who knows; maybe [Company] pushed the button that allows us to grab a new TPS with a tailwind. So I said I'll request a new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind and see what it says. He said; we are in flight; you can't request a new TPS because we are in flight. I said sure you can and pushed the button and spit it out. I showed him the new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind compared to our original TPS and both were identical. The Captain was in the TPS flow chart in the QRH and was in disbelief that it didn't say that you could request a new TPS with a tailwind. He then said 'damn it if I'm going to lose a beer over this'. At this point; I stopped him and said the he wasn't going to lose a beer because we aren't playing a game of who knows what. There have been a ton of changes and if something as important as when to call Maintenance or how to know if we're legal for takeoff; I want to know. That was it. At this point I realized that tension was building. The Captain was irritated that I was challenging him. I decided at this point that I wasn't going to speak up unless I absolutely had to. Now one thing I didn't mention was that the Captain briefed the flight attendants to stay seated for 1 hr and 30 minutes after takeoff as a precaution because of what was left of the hurricane. We were routed around to the north of it but he still kept them down. I thought that was excessive. The ride was smooth. I didn't say anything. Nor did I say a thing when we had to deviate around cells. He would do an all call and tell everyone to take their seats. We were deviating a long way around these cells and I had absolutely no doubt that it would be a smooth ride. We even had reports from other aircraft that the ride was smooth. The other thing I felt was odd; was that less than one minute after he called the flight attendants; he was surprised that they were still dealing with their carts and not already in their seats. I honestly don't think he has any idea what the flight attendants have to do to clean up and sit down. The flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 was mostly smooth. We have specific guidance in regards to the ride quality when it comes to flight attendants and passengers.Either way we had an uneventful flight to ZZZ1 and we had good conversation. The next morning we were getting ready for our leg back to ZZZ. We were ready for departure but I believe we had to wait for traffic behind us. The Captain put the delay for pay purposes into ACARS. I was just making small talk and said I heard there was a potentially easier way of doing it that might save him time. This set him off. The Captain kept saying; almost yelling 'it's amazing when you upgrade everyone tries to prove you wrong. Just you wait; it's amazing. Everyone just tries to prove you wrong.' This little rant went on for an uncomfortable amount of time. I finally stopped him and said that is absolutely not what I'm trying to do and that I'm sorry that I somehow came off that way. I said that there have been so many big changes that it's very difficult to keep up and so easy to miss. I told him how just last month I was told that I was doing a checklist incorrectly. We looked it up and sure enough they were correct. I told him there were no hard feelings and I was glad it was brought to my attention. That was the end of that conversation.  I want to be clear the reason I wrote such detail about the events leading up to the diversion is because I think it's important and can better understand how we ended up in ZZZ2. It's my leg to ZZZ from ZZZ1. We are in a full 320. We have been airborne for less than 20 minutes. The Captain is eating his kung pow kitty as the Flight Attendant calls. She said she turned the oven on and about 1 minute later smoke started coming out. Captain asked if she turned it off and she said she did. He instructed her not to open the oven and that we are diverting. He hangs up with her; looks at me and said smoke in the cabin; we're going down now! Before I could say a word he grabs the mic and [advises ATC] and said we needed to get on the ground immediately. He then dons his O2 mask even though there wasn't even a hint of smoke or even a smell in the flight deck. Because his was on; I grabbed mine. After about 2 minutes; the Captain realized he couldn't communicate very well and he takes it off; as do I. Now I can't remember if we knew on initial contact that the oven was no longer smoking or if it was just a few minutes later. Either way; the Captain and I knew that there were dinner rolls in the oven; it started smoking 1 minute after she turned it on and that it stopped smoking as soon as she turned the oven off.I could not believe we were diverting....for toast. The Captain was busy running the smoke in the cabin checklist and I was flying the plane and talking to ATC. I strongly considered talking to the Captain and asking if we should possibly reconsider the diversion since it doesn't seem to be a safety of flight issue. Considering the way he has responded to any type of questioning; and the fact that he was currently deep in the yellow and headed for the red; if I questioned his judgement; it would have put him through the roof and that would have been very unsafe in any phase of flight; especially a diversion. I decided the safest course was to just go along with his diversion and not question him. During the diversion; he must have fired off a text to Dispatch saying we needed to divert. I don't know what his message said. Initially I suggested we turn back towards ZZZ1. So we did. I then realized we were far too heavy for the short runway. I pulled up ZZZ3 and it was too far for the Captain. At this time Dispatch responds and said to divert to ZZZ2. I plug it in and it was 40 miles to the East. I said Dispatch said to go to ZZZ2. He said that's where he wants to go also. I told ATC and we started to head that way. I slowed the plane down to give us time; changed destination and set up for the ILS. I did the landing distance for our weight and it said around 8;000 feet; we had 13;200 feet. I briefed the Captain and told him I was doing flaps full with manual auto brakes. Since we had such a long runway I was going to stay off the brakes until under 100 kts to keep them from getting too hot. I told him I already spoke with ATC and said we'd either make a right turn off or back taxi. He cut me off and said we were going to be stopping on the runway and having the trucks look us over with their equipment and look for any hot spots and to also check our brake temps. I had a nice touchdown and used the brakes as I briefed. We came to a stop and watched the trucks surround us. As we sit there we put the brake fans on; the temps never got over 220. Minutes go by and I said I'll use this time to call Tower and ask exactly where we are parking. I got snapped at by the Captain once again. He said I needed to calm down and to stop interfering with their emergency procedures. A short time later; Tower called us asking if we were ready to taxi yet. Captain responded that after the fire trucks have looked us over and checked our brake temps that we'd then be able to taxi. Tower said he were completely fine. Again; our brake temps were never above 220. Captain tells Tower we are ready to taxi and we do. There were ramp personnel waiting for us and they parked us on the ramp just before where they park the RJ's so we don't block them. Air stairs are brought to our plane and the fire fighters confirm there is no fire and they leave. At this point we haven't deplaned. Captain looked to me and said he said he was done flying and that it would be unsafe for us to continue due to the nature of the high stress emergency. I said that I think we should consider just getting fuel and continuing. Of course we needed an overweight inspection. He said we were done. So now we needed to get the passengers to the terminal.

Disagreements arose regarding procedures, such as requesting a new TPS in flight, leading to growing tension. During the return leg, smoke from the oven, caused by burning dinner rolls, prompted the Captain to divert to ZZZ2. Despite the First Officer's consideration of continuing, the Captain, under stress, opted for an overweight inspection and refused to proceed further. This resulted in a delay, with passengers disembarking and the aircraft being parked for the night.",between attendant and crew

One; if the crew never left the gate when they encountered a power distribution irregularity when switching from ground to APU power. Two; if Line Control had a Jetway Operator standing by at the gate. And three; if there was a better and clearer communication between the maintenance crew.I received a gate call on the radio; that Aircraft X was coming back to the gate; due to a 'Warn Elec' message on EICAS. I was informed by Line Control that Aircraft X was returning to the gate and was asked if I needed the jetway to be pulled up. I replied 'Yes I will need the jetway pulled up'. Myself and two mechanics that were assigned to Aircraft X; headed out to the gate. As we approached the gate; the ground crew were getting ready to greet the aircraft; no Jetway Operator. At this time I made a second request to Line Control; for a Jetway Operator. The aircraft arrives; the ground crew guide the plane in. One Mechanic jumps on the headset; the other climbs in to the E compartment to reset circuit breakers.I was thumbing through the iPad; looking for possible causes in the AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) and FIM (Fault Isolation Manual) procedures. Maintenance was ready to go. Still no Jetway. At this time I decided not to wait any longer and go through the hatch of the plane and get onboard. I pointed upstairs to the Mechanic on the headset. I got his attention a second time and mouthed 'upstairs' and pointed upwards again. He nodded. As I am climbing in the E compartment; I got the other Mechanic's attention. He had told me that he reset circuit breakers and that I should see if the message cleared. I agreed.I banged on the hatch before opening it; then proceeded to crack it open. I saw light; looked clear to open. Heard a yell; then a foot come through; hitting me on the head; face; then right shoulder. I reacted by catching a foot with a black shoe and proceeded to hoist the foot to safety; by placing it in the galley on solid ground. I got out and I saw an elderly gentleman; a Flight Attendant; sobbing from pain sitting down. At this point I headed into the cockpit and I started pushing buttons to clear the message. No help. The First Officer and the Observer were explaining the problem they encountered before leaving the gate initially. The Captain was more concerned with the Flight Attendant; than getting this plane out. He took his time and explained to the passengers in great detail of the happenings that occurred. He should have just assured the passengers that matters would be solved quickly and swiftly; instead of shining the light on us maintenance. He was very rude and never once did anyone ask me if I was okay.Now; people are starting to show up. Port Authority police; some safety members from our maintenance department; one other mechanic. Through this bad ordeal; I am disappointed as to treatment that I was subjected to by the Port Authority police; the Captain and one female flight attendant; who felt that her opinion mattered more than the professionalism required to maintain in front of our customers. It never ceases to amaze me on how insignificant we as mechanics are made to feel by other departments here at [Company]. I thought we were all on the same team!,,,,Mechanic reported that a Flight Attendant was injured when he accidentally stepped through an open floor hatch.,"The incident occurred when a maintenance crew responded to a 'Warn Elec' message on an aircraft, leading them to attempt resetting circuit breakers. Due to a delay in obtaining a jetway operator, the maintenance team proceeded without one, resulting in a mechanic entering the aircraft through an open hatch. During this process, a flight attendant accidentally stepped through the hatch, causing injuries to both the flight attendant and the mechanic. The Captain's management of the situation and subsequent interaction with the maintenance crew were perceived as disrespectful, highlighting a need for improved interdepartmental communication and support systems. Proposed solutions include ensuring a jetway operator is available and enhancing communication protocols to prevent such incidents. The outcome underscores the importance of teamwork and respect in addressing technical issues efficiently.",between attendant and crew

I walked out and a mother said her toddler had to use the restroom and couldn't wait. I told the woman that I needed to contact the Captain and see if it was possible to let her use the facility before departure. I walked back to the aft inter phone and called the cockpit. The Captain said we would pull off to the side and she would have about 2-3 minutes to use the lavatory. I walked back out into the cabin and relayed the information to her and said to wait until the plane stopped and to make it as quick as possible. The aircraft turned and when we stopped the woman handed the toddler to her husband and they headed to the back lavatory. As the father and toddler entered the lavatory there was a single high-low chime. I headed back to the aft inter phone as the [Flight Attendant] A cleared us for departure. I called the Captain to remind him that we had a passenger and toddler in the lavatory and he responded 'we are going; tell them to hang on'. I knocked on the lavatory door and told the passengers to hang on; that we were taking off and to please stay in there until I said it was safe to come out (keep in mind that there were no empty seats towards the back and they were about 15 rows from their seat). It is very bumpy for the first 5-10 minutes in LAS this time of year and I didn't want them up for initial ascent either. We took off and around the 10;000 ft. ding I escorted the gentleman and toddler back to their seats. The Captain called back via the inter phone and apologized and said something to the effect of 'we were supposed to be second for departure but they moved us up'.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that Captain elected to take off with a gentleman and toddler in the lavatory.,"The incident occurred during a flight's initial stages at LAS airport, where a mother requested her toddler use the restroom before departure. The flight attendant informed the Captain, who agreed to allow the passenger to use the lavatory, giving them approximately 2-3 minutes. After the passengers entered the lavatory, the Captain decided to expedite departure, despite the flight attendant's reminder that the passengers were still inside. The aircraft took off, and around 10,000 feet, the flight attendant escorted the gentleman and toddler back to their seats. The Captain later apologized, explaining that the flight was moved up in the departure order. The flight attendant ensured the passengers' safety during the process.",between attendant and crew

Saturdays are busier than normal but no effort to adjust that today.  Then management assigns domestic on what they thought was an open desk [XX] but that desk was open and they make that domestic dispatcher who showed at XA00 to move off the desk they assigned in error to desk [XX] one and half hours after being here; in that time of moving desk to desk [YY] they received several calls (please note that releases have that desk number on it) so the one remaining international desk [ZZ] has to now answer and transfer the calls to correct desk; while working their new workload which is in beginning of shift and they are also working to remain in control of desk. The Domestic Dispatcher is now rushing to move and reset up and transfer flights between desks; and of course there are several calls and now all desks in international which where reduced by two are forced to help the lone domestic dispatcher with these issues; in addition.  Now that this Dispatcher moved all but one flight was moved that was caught by incoming Dispatcher and moved to the original desk that had it on the domestic side since new Dispatcher was also on a call and still trying to set up their new desk.  The phones kept ringing on wrong desk and the lone Domestic Dispatcher asked for help not knowing that two of the International Dispatchers where already on phone with the Domestic Dispatchers other issues.  I asked the International Dispatcher next to me to get the Chief to lend assistance but they where in the bridge morning meeting discussing the weather and daily assignments.  The International Dispatcher came back to report that Chief was unavailable; and I suggested that the Chief needs to leave that meeting and help domestic dispatcher for they are swamped and bringing down the entire Caribbean team; so the other dispatcher went to Chief and insisted on getting help for domestic dispatch and fortunately there was a Chief in training who came down to answer phones and lend a hand.  The phone calls I took where Flight ABCD time off gate was generated in error and needed to be removed; Flight DAEE was in ZZZ going to ZZZ1 and they where given a ground delay and ATC re-route so then I had to get reroute ensure compliance build that route and verify that we had petrol to accomplish this: I got so in detailed with this issues I did not get time out and I had to ask International Dispatcher to remove that time.  While working on weather briefing and re-route another of the Domestic lines where ringing and all International Dispatchers where on phone so I grabbed the call and placed them on hold to finish re-route but that person hung up and then called.  I advised the captain of Flight DAEE that I would finish re-route after I briefed on weather and send them an ACARS with route and burns; since the Domestic Dispatcher was at this point under water and not coming up.  The Captain said that would be fine and I built his new route while I answered another one of the Domestic Dispatchers phone lines.  This was a flight attendant who once I answered she said they had a medical emergency and needed Medlink!  I asked for flight number while I was still engaged in the re-route for the Domestic Dispatch (placing all my international desk and its duties on lower priority).  The Flight Attendant (FA) was not using proper radio telephone procedure; nor had any patience; to connect to Medlink we need basic info flight number; age; gender; problem or issue but the FA when placed on hold thought they where disconnected and called back but to further aspirate the issue they called the original desk domestic side of room and needed to be transferred to international side of room.  So this one flight and one flight attendant had to be spoken to sternly just to remain on line with Medlink.  Now once Medlink got on lineagain the FA did not provide information had to be extracted by Medlink and that conversation was very difficult because the FA world speak pause and speak not allowing Medlink to speak or speaking over Medlink with the constant live mic one of the mics stuck open and there was a constant hiss in back ground and flight attendant kept telling doctor to speak louder and the doctor was practically yelling; finally the FA said that they could not hear so I ACARS crew to have PIC call in and speak to Medlink; since the doctor on board was saying they needed to land now; the Domestic Dispatcher got that call and remained on line with the Medlink and did divert the flight but this poor planning of management and multiple error caused problems for a international section that was already task saturated due to managements closing of several desk and distributing that international workload.Several failures:  First Management not understanding that it is not the number of flights but the quality of work and the management team has closed desk that was originally planned open based on published schedule.  Second; Management not familiar with work on quad and placed a Domestic Dispatcher on a weekend International desk; third; the decision to move was not well thought or executed and if it was not for another dispatcher an airborne flight would have been left unattended; Forth; placing a domestic dispatcher in an area by themselves with no support of other domestic dispatchers working similar area and familiar with weather; GDP; and ATC initiatives; fifth; only having one chief who was also task saturated; sixth; not having properly training flight attendants on proper radio telephone etiquette and protocol. Stop closing desk; and Staff properly (follow workload committee models numbers and not a number that is not truly representative of the actual work.  Have sector managers that come from ranks of dispatch and fully understand issues on floor or at least have them trained by dispatch instructors who have worked the floor.  Place like dispatchers together i.e. domestic working NE or ZZZ1 or SE together so highest quality of information is properly disseminated to flight crews without taking extra time and further task saturating the other dispatchers and areas.  Have an International Chief and Domestic Chief (or at least two Chiefs; who are current and qualified to better aid floor dispatchers).  Properly train all flight attendants for proper radio telephone etiquette and protocol.,,,,Dispatcher reported staffing issues resulting in being inundated with various tasks and moving from the desk to desk in order try to maintain operational control and communications with their flights.,"The incident arose from a combination of poor management decisions and miscommunication within the dispatch team, leading to a highly task-saturated workload and operational breakdown. The root cause included the reduction of international desks without adjusting the workload, assigning a domestic dispatcher to an international desk during peak hours, and insufficient staffing planning. These decisions overwhelmed the remaining dispatchers, who were forced to handle an influx of calls and re-routing of flights while managing their own workload. Additionally, a flight attendant's lack of proper radio telephone protocol compounded the issue during a medical emergency, requiring the intervention of a Chief in training to assist the overwhelmed domestic dispatcher. The result was a near-disruption of operations, with the flight being diverted due to the poor planning and lack of support. The dispatcher highlighted several systemic failures, including inadequate staffing models, lack of trained leadership, and insufficient training for flight attendants. Proposed solutions included restoring proper staffing levels, having dedicated international and domestic chiefs, and improving training for both dispatchers and flight attendants to prevent similar incidents.",between attendant and crew

Bottom line is the Captain never said 'prepare for departure.'Captain must say prepare for departure...if he doesn't we might think that chime was just a call light or something of that nature.,,,,Flight attendant reported that the Captain did not notify the cabin crew before takeoff; resulting in a departure with flight attendants standing in the galley.,"The incident was triggered by the Captain's failure to issue the standard ""prepare for departure"" command before takeoff. Upon hearing a chime, the flight crew, including the flight attendant, assumed it might be a routine call light. Without the Captain's command, they stood in the galley during takeoff. The carts were not secured, requiring the crew to hold them in place to prevent movement. This situation posed a safety risk, as the crew was not properly positioned for takeoff, potentially hindering their ability to respond to emergencies.

I updated my flight and looked at crew portal where I saw that I had been placed on a trip to ZZZ1 that was supposed to leave a bit later. The door was shut and taxiout started. I started the safety video and my phone rang from crew scheduling. I answered the call; thinking that I needed to; since there was confusion about the working crew and the ZZZ trip listed. Crew scheduling told me to go directly to the gate for the ZZZ trip and I informed them our pre-board had been told by the agent we were going. They told me they had no idea that we were taking the ZZZ1 trip. After hanging up; the video was still playing for safety and I knew that I probably should not have answered the phone.I know not to answer my phone on board the aircraft.,,,,Flight attendant reported answering a phone call from crew scheduling during taxi; resulting in a policy violation.,"The incident occurred due to confusion regarding crew assignments. A flight attendant was called to assist with pre-boarding a flight to ZZZ and was informed by the gate agent that they would board as the incoming crew was delayed. After boarding, the pilot announced they were departing, and the attendant noticed a discrepancy in their assigned trip on the crew portal. During taxi, the attendant's phone rang from crew scheduling, prompting them to answer despite knowing they shouldn't use their phone on the aircraft. This led to a policy violation. The result was a reprimand for the flight attendant, who received additional training on communication protocols.

The lead FA had instructed another FA to inform the crew that the First Officer was an FFDO after the aircraft door had closed. However, due to a hectic pre-takeoff taxi process, where passengers repeatedly needed to be reminded to sit down and fasten their seatbelts, the information was inadvertently forgotten. The lead FA proposed a potential solution: implementing a system in the computer to denote FFDOs with a triangle symbol, which could help ensure the information was readily accessible during busy boarding or pre-takeoff procedures.

The crew was; at that moment not aware of any inoperative chiller on the aircraft. During the briefing with the Captain; and after checking the list of maintenance issues in my link; there was no mention about an inoperative chiller. The two carrier boxes posed a significant tripping hazard to our customers boarding; but the catering representative refused to remove the carrier boxes; stating that the flight attendants should take them on board. The carrier boxed where too heavy to lift; and it is my understanding that we should not carry heave carrier boxes full of dangerous goods through an aircraft with customers on board. An In-flight Supervisor was in the area and was unhelpful in resolving this dangerous situation. While I was trying to have these carrier boxes with dry ice removed; this Supervisor displayed aggressive behavior and stating if I was refusing the dry ice and taking a delay. He was unwilling to listen or understand the problem with having two carrier boxes full of dry ice being placed in front of the boarding door while customers were boarding. At this point I was informed by the Captain that chiller number 7 in the aft galley had an issue and the fuse was pulled. No one informed the crew about this.

I had my MFD on the status page before push and all doors showed green. We did before start flows and before start checklist. We were cleared to push and also to cleared to start engines shortly thereafter. I reached over and started engine one. The number one engine was fully online and had stabilized when we received a master caution. The EICAS message was saying that the front door on the FO (First Officer) side was ajar. By this time we had completed the push and the ground crew was working on getting the airplane ready for taxi. The Captain called back to the flight attendants to check on the door and maybe try to recycle it. We sat there as we heard the Flight Attendant try to get the door shut. After a few seconds of messing with the door; I heard a loud hiss and the airplane started shaking. At that point we had determined that the slide had been deployed. The Flight Attendant then called to let us know what had happened. He tried opening the door and then closing it again. This was an honest mistake and had no malicious intent. It was an abnormal situation in a high pressure environment.The cause could've been a quick misinterpretation of wording between the crew. The FA (Flight Attendant) was told to recycle the door and I've heard that wording can be misinterpreted throughout the whole [company] fleet.Change the wording in the in-flight manual for the words 'recycling doors.' I've heard it can mean something different in all the airplanes and I guess maybe it was taken one way or [another] the night of the incident.,,After push back in ZZZ on Aircraft X; we had an accidental slide deployment. Prior to push back; I verified the doors were green and told the ramp crew we were cleared to push. As we started the number 1 engine; once it came online we received a 'DOOR SERVICE FWD OPEN' warning message. I called back to the flight attendants and the number one answered. I had interrupted the safety demo that he was already doing. There must have been a perceived miscommunication as the next thing I knew there was a slide deployment. Thankfully no one was hurt when this honest mistake occurred and there was no willful intent by any crew member to deploy the slide.I believe the cause was miscommunication on the interphone between the CA (Captain) and the number one FA (Flight Attendant.) A contributing factor was the delayed flight and a rushed turn at the outstation.In the future I intend to treat any door issue similar to this event with a better initial reaction. First words to the FA will be to ensure the door is disarmed while following procedures more specifically.,,ERJ-175 flight crew reported an inadvertent emergency slide deployment after pushback.,"The incident involved an ERJ-175 flight crew and a flight attendant during departure from ZZZ. After starting the first engine, a warning indicated a forward door was ajar. The flight crew communicated with the attendant to check and recycle the door. During this, the emergency slide deployed, an inadvertent deployment with no injuries. The cause was attributed to a miscommunication regarding the term ""recycle,"" leading to confusion. Contributing factors included a delayed flight and rushed procedures.

When I came around to take his order; he; confusingly reading the menu; asked for items we didn't have on the menu. He then orders a Jack and Coke. I checked his ID to make sure he was of age and said no problem. As I was taking the next rows order; he interrupts me asking where to buy the snacks. I explained to him we'd be around shortly with pretzels as our snack option. As I went back to taking orders; he interrupts me again asking if he could use the lavatory. I explained to him the seatbelt sign was on and I was not able to give him permission as long as the seatbelt sign was illuminated. At this point; I finished taking orders and waited behind the B Flight Attendant as she finished taking her last row of orders. Passenger apparently got up right after I informed him the seatbelt sign was on because I felt a hard tap on my shoulder of him explaining he had to use the bathroom. I told him politely that we both needed to wait until she was done taking her last order. At this point; I informed the B of unusually behavior from him. As I was pouring drinks and the B was putting pretzels in the snack basket; the passenger came bolting out of the lavatory; leaving the door wide open. As I went to close the door; the B and I both realized he smelled strongly of marijuana. I walked into the lavatory and smelled an even greater odor of marijuana. There is no doubt in my mind at this point; that the passenger was smoking weed in the bathroom. We went up to talk to the A; called the Captain and all decided that we needed police assistance upon landing. We also decided to monitor the passenger. Passenger appeared paranoid and edgy as he watched us call the Captain and watched each of us every time we walked by. Upon landing; police met him and questioned him. He admitted to using a vape pen but said it was not marijuana. He said he could not find said vape pen. Ultimately he had to be let go for no evidence. As passenger was walking away; he [waved] good bye to police and the vape pen fell out of his pants. He was taken into custody and I wrote a police report. The vape pen was tested positive for marijuana. Passenger also admitted to smoking in the cabin during his interrogation.,,Flight attendants reported misconduct by a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight.,"The incident involved a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight, leading to a conflict with the flight attendants. The flight attendants noticed a strong smell of marijuana when the passenger exited the aft lavatory and observed smoke inside the lavatory. The passenger appeared paranoid and initially lied to the police about his actions. The flight attendants called the captain, and upon landing, police were summoned. During questioning, the passenger denied using marijuana but later admitted to smoking in the cabin and lavatory after a vape pen, which tested positive for THC, was found in his possession. The passenger was detained, and the flight attendants reported the incident to the authorities. The flight attendant experienced throat irritation and a headache, possibly due to the effects of THC exposure. The police confirmed the vape pen contained THC, leading to the passenger's confession and detention.",between attendant and crew

To me it appeared to be a hover board. I did question the Ops Agent; asked him if he looked it up; he said yes. He also told me TSA let them come through with it. I then asked him if he could show me. He then took the device and sent it down for cargo. I went to the Captain to bring it to her attention. I then started to look it up in my manual. I could not find verbiage regarding this particular device. Understanding it was a mobility device. Where it concerns me is Ops was not able to verify the type of battery in the device.,,Female passenger preboarded the aircraft using an assistive device that appeared to be a hoverboard with a handle. The A Flight Attendant (FA) inquired about the type of battery powering the device and the passenger didn't give a conclusive answer. She responded that in ZZZ; the ground staff consistently checked the device as checked baggage and in ZZZ1; they allowed her to stow the device in the wheelchair compartment; which was what I desired to do for her. The A FA and I communicated this to the Operations Agent; who curtly replied that TSA allowed it through and that he had tagged it to be checked. He never communicated with us that he had confirmed the type of battery inside the device and he verified that it was safe for travel in the cargo hold of the aircraft. If he had indeed safely verified he had checked the device thoroughly; he should have been able to answer the question about the type of battery powering the device and communicated that information with both the flight deck crew and the Flight Attendants. It is my belief that a potential safety violation occurred here; and if not; then the Operations Agent needed to communicate the information to the crew in a manner that allowed us to be sure that the device in question was carried safely. We departed ZZZ with that device in the cargo hold; unsure what type of battery was down there.,,Two air carrier Flight Attendants reported communication breakdown with Operations Agent regarding transport of battery powered 'Segway'.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between a flight attendant (FA) and ground personnel regarding the transport of a battery-powered Segway by a passenger. The passenger had boarded the aircraft using the Segway, which the FA perceived as a hoverboard. The FA questioned the Operations Agent (Ops Agent) about the type of battery in the device, as it was unclear and potentially concerning for safety reasons. The Ops Agent stated that TSA had approved the device and that it had been tagged as checked baggage. However, the Ops Agent did not confirm the type of battery or communicate this information to the flight deck crew and cabin staff, leaving the crew uncertain about the safety of the device in the cargo hold. The flight attendant attempted to verify the device's classification in the manual but found no relevant information. The incident concluded with the device loaded in the cargo hold, and the crew remained unsure about its safety. The FA expressed concerns about a potential safety violation or a failure in communication. No specific solution was proposed in the context.",between attendant and crew

On the past five flights; Captains have insisted upon leaving the seat belt sign on for the entire flight. Some are so brazen they make an announcement prior to take-off advising the sign will be left on for the entire flight! Keep in mind; flying times range between 6.5 to 9.5 hours. On past flights; I have attempted to employ/educate using CRM strategies with some Captains in order to understand their reasoning behind their actions of keeping the sign on. Most express concerns about liability related to passenger injury due to unexpected severe turbulence. Others state they are doing flight attendants a favor by not cycling the sign off during late night flights - minimizing need for compliance checks. I'm deeply concerned the negative safety culture this type of behavior is creating -- a dangerous risk for passengers and crew. It encourages passengers to disobey the sign while fostering complacency among flight attendants. For example; during my last flight; FAs stopped enforcing the requirement for passengers to be buckled due to the sign being constantly on and lack of turbulence. Their reasoning (understandable); belts were unnecessary due to the smooth ride. At one point; I counted at least 15 passengers in the aisle while the sign was on. This occurred about seven hours into the flight; following the breakfast service. Clearly a violation of 121.311 and portions of 121.571. I witnessed this more often on long range flights.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant expressed concern in regard to the overuse of the seat belt.,"The incident involves concerns raised by a flight attendant regarding the excessive use of the seat belt sign by flight deck crews, particularly captains, on multiple flights. The flight attendant reported that captains frequently left the seat belt sign on for the entire duration of flights, which ranged between 6.5 to 9.5 hours. Some captains even made pre-flight announcements about this practice. The flight attendant attempted to address this issue with the captains using CRM strategies, but the captains cited concerns about liability in case of severe turbulence and claimed they were minimizing compliance checks for flight attendants during late-night flights as reasons for their actions. The flight attendant expressed deep concern over the negative safety culture this behavior was fostering, as it encouraged passengers to ignore the seat belt sign and created complacency among flight attendants. During one flight, the flight attendant observed at least 15 passengers in the aisle while the seat belt sign was on, approximately seven hours into the flight, following breakfast service. This situation violated Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 121.311 and portions of 121.571. The flight attendant noted that this behavior occurred more frequently on long-range flights. No specific solution was proposed in the context of the incident, but the flight attendant emphasized the need for addressing the safety risks associated with the misuse of the seat belt sign.",between attendant and crew

In training we are told to open the lavatory; visually inspect; close the lavatory; and then lock it. The flight operations manual section states that the flight attendants will ensure the surrounding area is secure including all lavatories. B777 pilots are being verbally told to lock the lavatories doors open; language which is not in the flight operations manual. This concerns me as it is contradicting to what our security section/training calls for. Most of the time during pilot/Purser briefing I am acknowledged and the pilots comply with the proper security procedures. While working [a recent flight] I briefed the Captain as to what is required by our training. He refused to acknowledge the procedures outlined in our manual and I was forced to leave the lavatory doors open during cockpit entry/exit. This action compromised the integrity of security and left the cockpit vulnerable; however; because he was the Pilot in Command I was forced to comply.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported some pilots are requiring cockpit entry/exit procedures that are contrary to Flight Attendant training.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding cockpit entry/exit procedures. The flight attendant adhered to training and manual protocols, which require lavatory doors to be locked during cockpit access. However, some pilots have verbally instructed the flight attendants to keep the lavatory doors open, a practice not aligned with established procedures. During a recent flight, the flight attendant briefed the captain on the required security measures, but the captain refused to acknowledge them, forcing the flight attendant to leave the lavatory doors open. This compromise in security left the cockpit vulnerable. The flight attendant expressed concern over the inconsistency between training and pilot directives, which could potentially undermine safety protocols.",between attendant and crew

At the same time the Number 2 FA picked up the inter-phone and began speaking. The Number 3 FA was a little bit frantic and vague in his communication. I attempted to get more information from him but he had hung up his inter-phone. About 30 seconds later; I called back to the Number 3 FA. He answered and I asked him to calm down and tell me what happened. He said the #1FA had hit his head on a 'tray table.' I asked if he was ok and did he need any medical assistance. He said the Number 1 FA was ok and no medical assistance was required. The remainder of the flight was without further issue. After parking the aircraft at ZZZ; I went back to the forward cabin to ask the Number 1 FA what happened. He had a small ice pack on his head. He removed it and had a light reddish bruise where he had obviously hit his head. I asked him to describe to me what happened. He said he was sitting in the FA jump seat; facing aft. When he stood up; he hit his head on the side of a metal tray which extends from the storage area just aft of the FA jump seat. I then asked him if he felt ok or needed medical assistance. He said he had a little bit of a 'headache' but otherwise felt ok. He said he felt ok to work the return leg to ZZZ1. He did request that when we arrived back to ZZZ1 that a supervisor meet us at the gate. I agreed that I would notify ZZZ1 Operations when we were in range. There was no turbulence or other weather related events. There were no external factors contributing to this injury. All normal procedures were being followed. All cabin crew members continue to be aware of their surrounding work environment and continue to exercise diligence. Flight attendants are trained how to handle medical situations in the cabin area and how to effectively communicate this to the flight deck. The Number 3 FA could have done a better job remaining calm; analyzing the non-life threatening situation and communicating this to the flight deck.,,,,B737-800 Captain reported poor communication with Flight Attendant relating to a Flight Attendant's injury.,"The incident occurred during the descent of a B737-800 aircraft into ZZZ, approximately 20 minutes before landing. The Number 1 Flight Attendant (FA) sustained a minor injury when his head struck a metal tray in the cabin while standing in the forward cabin. The Number 3 FA reported the injury to the flight deck via interphone, initially appearing frantic and vague. The Number 2 FA also attempted to communicate the situation. The captain, after calming the Number 3 FA, learned that the Number 1 FA was conscious, had a small bruise, and declined medical assistance. The Number 1 FA reported a minor headache but felt capable of continuing the flight. The flight landed without further issues, and the Number 1 FA requested a supervisor to meet the aircraft upon arrival at ZZZ1.

As we were ready to close the cockpit door; the A F/A (Flight Attendant) stated that we had 139 + 1 infant. I conferred with the [Gate] Agent; and confirmed with our F/A's that the infant was in fact in a lap and not in a seat. After a discussion on the radio; the [Gate] Agent confirmed that we did in fact have 139 + 1; as one boarding pass had not been scanned; even though that passenger had boarded. She sent us Version 2 of the Takeoff Data with the updated count; we re-accomplished the Before Push Checklist; and the flight proceeded normally.GENERAL SAFETY CONCERN: This isn't the first time I've had this situation occur. It's easiest to catch on full or nearly full flights with a senior 'C' F/A who still counts the number of empty seats before pushback. Various things can set up the situation where this error can occur; a boarding pass that isn't scanned will do it; or an [Gate] Agent who assumes that the thru count is correct without verifying can cause it as well. I've seen that too; the deplaning F/A's got a thru-count; but the [Gate] Agent never asked for it; and the oncoming F/A's were never asked or told what it was. The [Gate] Agent blindly assumed that the count was right; and she was wrong. (That error got caught because it occurred before the final passenger count was abolished.) With current procedures; if the thru-count is off and the subsequent flight isn't full; NOTHING will catch this sort of error after it gets made. 'What's the thru-count supposed to be? 28. Yeah; we have 28.' (No; you have 29; because the 4th Rider; in a seat; is staying on even though the operational information system thinks she's getting off here; but you didn't catch it because another passenger was using the lav when you counted and you weren't aware of it. Or because you got distracted during the count; and it was like 27 or 28 or something; and it's easier to say 'yeah; we have 28' than to go back and count again.) These errors happen ALL THE TIME; but now we are generally oblivious to them; whereas before the procedure change; 'count's off; have to count again' was common. Sometimes the F/A's count before push was simply off and the recount straightened everything out; but other times there was a real discrepancy between the number of people that the computer had on the aircraft; and the true number. The ramifications of errors like this are two-fold. First; the aircraft is operated with an inaccurate ZFW (Zero Fuel Weight) and Takeoff Gross Weight. This means that the aircraft is operated in a non-compliant manner with certainty; even though the actual impact of a 200 or even 400 pound error is essentially nil. Second; however; in the event of an aircraft accident; having an accurate count of Souls On Board can be absolutely vital; and an inaccurate count may be the difference between leaving someone on the aircraft who could be rescued; or sending a firefighter into an aircraft in search of an individual who was never there in the first place. In other words; an accurate count makes no difference whatsoever; until that one day when it is of life and death importance. It frankly astounds me that; at the same time that we obsess over 97 bags versus 98 bags (at 50 pounds each); with elaborate checks and verification between the ramp agents and the [Gate] Agent; we willingly forgo the best and only verification of what the computer says about our number of passengers (at 200 pounds each). How the FAA can require no counting of people actually onboard the aircraft at the same time they require exact accountability of bags; is beyond me. An extra passenger; as we had today; is four times as consequential in terms of aircraft weight as an extra bag; and infinitely more important as a soul to be rescued and accounted for in the event of an accident.The FAA should require Company to return to the previous practice of counting the actual number of people who are physically onboard the aircraft prior to pushing back from the gate. Yes; those counts take time; and when a Flight Attendant miscounts; it takes time to resolve the error. But; isn't an accurate count of the number of lives in our care worth it?,,,,B737 Captain reported an inaccurate passenger count prior to departure.,"An incident occurred involving a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding an inaccurate passenger count prior to departure. The flight captain noticed a discrepancy in the ""Souls On Board"" count, initially reporting 144 souls (138 passengers, 1 infant, and 5 crew) based on the Weight and Balance report. The flight attendant, however, stated there were 139 passengers plus an infant. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the infant was in a lap, not a seat. The flight crew consulted with the gate agent and verified the counts. A boarding pass had not been scanned, leading to the error. The gate agent confirmed the count and provided an updated Takeoff Data version, prompting a recalculation of the Before Push Checklist. The flight proceeded normally after the resolution. The flight captain highlighted that such discrepancies often occur due to unverified boarding passes or gate agents assuming counts are accurate without confirmation. They emphasized the critical importance of accurate passenger counts for aircraft weight calculations and emergency response, proposing that the FAA require a return to physically counting passengers before departure, despite the time it may take. This practice, the captain argued, ensures the safety and accurate accounting of lives on board.",between attendant and crew

It was not until [we] looked out the service window; that they were able to notice the street lights coming into view. That was when the landing gear was [extending]. Both FA's (Flight Attendants) rushed through the cabin to try to assist passengers and secure the cabin. As FWD FA walked back to the galley; the momentum pushed her into a jog and she yelled at the AFT FA; 'Get down.' [AFT FA] was able to make it to her jump seat safely and secure herself. This momentum caused [another FA] to run into the flight deck door; hit her head and bounced off. Due to the stress of the situation; neither flight attendants were fully able to secure the cabin or galley before landing. FO (First Officer) said that he did do the chime but there was a system malfunction. Captain wrote up the plane after jet bridge was extended.,,,,CRJ900 Flight Attendant reported that the cabin crew was not alerted to final descent.,"The incident occurred on a CRJ900 flight when the final descent chime, intended to alert the cabin crew, malfunctioned and did not sound. As a result, the flight attendants were not promptly informed of the aircraft's preparation for landing. Approximately 20 minutes before landing, the initial descent announcement was made, and the flight attendants began securing the galley and performing last-minute tasks. However, the absence of the final descent chime caused them to remain unaware of the impending landing until they noticed street lights outside the aircraft, indicating that the landing gear was being extended. In response, the flight attendants rushed to secure the cabin and assist passengers. During this rush, the forward flight attendant was pushed into a jog and yelled for the aft attendant to ""Get down."" The aft attendant safely reached her jump seat, while another flight attendant collided with the flight deck door, sustaining a head injury. Due to the sudden and stressful situation, neither attendant was able to fully secure the cabin or galley before landing.

Captain insisted they could still fly without it. His alternate protocol was to open the flight deck door during takeoff and landing. Flight Attendant X was very uncomfortable with this and was saying it is against what her manual says. She was peer pressured and guilted by the Captain into operating all four flights with the flight deck door open. The company has taken on more contracts than they can handle with their fleet and amount of crew members. Aircraft have fallen into disrepair; and those who complain about it are punished; those who operate flights illegally get more money in their pockets. This Captain is notorious for flying any aircraft and allowing crew scheduling to manipulate his hours so that he can work more than what is legal for a big chunk of money. I contacted manager of inflight; Chief Pilot; Director of Operations; and Director of Safety prior to flying this morning. I showed them that the manual says 'an aircraft cannot depart if the interphone system between flight deck and cabin is inoperative.' I contacted another Captain who showed me that even on the MEL list; at least 50 percent of cabin interphones must be able to reach flight deck. None of ours did. I only received a reply from our Director of Operations saying that 'In certain circumstances it can be done.' He then stated he did not find it safe for a Captain to take off and land with the flight deck door open. However this Captain will never receive any questioning about his protocol because the company is just relieved the flights operated.,,,,Flight Attendant reported aircraft interphone was inoperative and the Captain continued the operation with flight deck door open.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and a Flight Captain regarding the operation of a flight with an inoperative interphone system. The Flight Attendant reported that the interphone system, which is a critical communication link between the flight deck and cabin, was not functioning. According to the aircraft manual, the aircraft should not depart if the interphone system is inoperative. However, the Captain insisted that the flight could proceed by opening the flight deck door during takeoff and landing as an alternative protocol. The Flight Attendant expressed discomfort with this approach, as it contradicted the manual, but was reportedly pressured and guilted by the Captain into complying with the protocol for four consecutive flights. The incident highlights issues within the company, including overloading its fleet and crew capacity, aircraft disrepair, and a culture where those who raise concerns about safety are punished, while those who operate flights illegally are rewarded financially. The Flight Attendant had previously raised concerns with multiple senior management personnel, including the Director of Operations, who acknowledged the potential safety risk but did not take definitive action to prevent the flight. The Captain, known for maximizing his flying hours and earnings, was not held accountable for his protocol, despite the risks involved. In summary, the incident reflects systemic management and safety concerns within the organization, including disregard for safety protocols, crew well-being, and regulatory compliance. A potential solution proposed was to review the manual's requirements, assess the Captain's flight hours, and investigate the interphone system's compliance with the MEL (Minimum Equipment List).",between attendant and crew

The Captain informed us that 'No-we aren't getting paid a penny to sit here!' We finally were able to leave the gate. Upon taxiing out; we were notified that we would not be departing for some time. We parked and the engines were shut down at some point. The passengers moved about the cabin to the lavatories during this delay. Approximately one hour later; the engines came back on and we heard the announcement 'Prepare for takeoff.' We made an announcement for passengers to return to their seats and bring their seatbacks and tray tables forward; as well as to stow laptops.While conducting our compliance check; I noticed that we were turning onto the runway and beginning to accelerate. The Number 4 Flight Attendant and I struggled to get to our jumpseats as the airplane was taking off. Following take off; there was a substantial amount of turbulence during the climb out. I called the Number 1 Flight Attendant and asked if they had heard a chime before takeoff. They had NOT; and indicated they had been scrambling to get to their jumpseats in time; as well. The Captain finally called to indicate it was probably safe to get up. I called him back to tell him that we were all in the aisle during takeoff; and that we did not hear a takeoff chime. He immediately defended himself; saying 'YES WE DID; we said prepare and chimed;' to which I replied 'Regardless; four of us did NOT hear the chime; and we were in the aisle during takeoff.' He told me that we would 'have a discussion on the ground.'Upon landing the Captain made no comment to us; and when the Number 4 Flight Attendant asked if we were going to discuss what had happened in the crew van; the Captain answered with a loud 'NO!' Pilots should always verify if the cabin is ready for takeoff following a significant delay and sit on the tarmac. A pilot briefing should always be conducted; even if flight is delayed.,,,,B737-800 Flight Attendant reported not receiving the proper pre-takeoff warning from the cockpit.,"The incident involved a B737-800 flight where the cabin crew reported not receiving the proper pre-takeoff warning from the cockpit. The flight attendant, working a delayed flight, noticed that the cabin crew did not hear the takeoff chime despite the Captain claiming it was heard. This omission led to confusion and safety concerns during takeoff, as the cabin crew was still in the aisle when the aircraft began accelerating. The Captain defended his actions, but no resolution was reached post-landing. The flight attendant suggested that pilots should verify cabin readiness after delays and conduct briefings to prevent such issues.",between attendant and crew

So; I wrote up aft cargo door L/H blowout panel and FWD LAV upper track guide screw which was broken in half. Maintenance arrived and began to thoughtfully address the issues. I was informed by a Line Mechanic that the blow out panel was missing 3 of 4 fasteners and they were checking on if they had another panel in stock. Shortly after that; a Maintenance Foreman or Supervisor showed up and said we're all good; everything is being signed off. I didn't see the new part arrive; so I asked the Foreman if they had brought and installed a new panel. He said; 'Yes; we installed the new panel and you're good to go.' When I later spoke with the Line Mechanic who actually did the work; he said they had not installed a new part; but had just taped in the old one. So; I found the Foreman and explained to him what was wrong with the old panel (3 missing fasteners) and that reinstalling it wasn't solving the problem. At that point; his story changed and he said they had found the fasteners in the cargo bay and reinstalled them into the panel before taping it up; so once again we are good to go! Then; he left. The remaining line mechanics were completing the paper work for the LAV door repair when I told the one who had done the work in the cargo how fortunate it was that they had found the 3 missing panel fasteners to which he looked befuddled and told me they hadn't found or installed any new fasteners; just taped in the old panel. He said that was why he refused to do the sign off on that job... so the Foreman signed it off. I called Maintenance Control and asked for Maintenance to reinspect the panel and was told they would do so and then 'rub your belly'. When Maintenance arrived to reinspect the panel; I was present when he removed the tape and panel which was still missing 3 of its 4 required ball-bearing fasteners. A new panel was ordered and another write-up was requested; which I did. During the delay; passengers were receiving regular updates and provided a water service. I had also tried to arrange regress to those who wanted off to reset the ground delay clock; but the Station refused to allow only a few off - it had to be all or nothing. When the new panel was ordered I deplaned all of the passengers. The part arrived and was installed fairly quickly; so we re-boarded and were preparing to depart when someone attempted to use the forward LAV and the door fell off its upper track again. We found the upper track screw on the floor and it was the exact same dirty one that was broke in half prior to the first repair. For some unknown reason; the broken screw (bolt) was reinstalled on the LAV door; so I wrote it up again. Maintenance came out and determined a new part or whole new door would be required which they said would take at least an hour; so we deplaned all of the passengers a second time. After the new LAV door was installed; it did not fit well and was scraping metal on metal across the top of the door; making the door hard to open and close; so I asked them to adjust it. They tried; but in the end; said it was as good as it was going to get. The door did open and close just not easily which in my opinion; will probably lead to another upper track screw failure; but it was signed off; so we boarded and finally completed the flight after a 4 hour and 16 minute delay. There is no doubt in my mind that the Maintenance Foreman lied directly to my face multiple times regarding maintenance that was supposedly performed; that is not acceptable. It was an unsafe act that could have been the first link in the chain of an accident/incident had I not intervened. By trying to save an hour delay; he caused a 4+ hour delay. I was told that this push; push; push; go; go; go; get it out by whatever means possible pressure was common place for that Foreman. I am concerned that his concept of risk management allowed him to reinstall a known defective piece of safety equipment (the pressurization blowout panel); sign it off; and lie about it to the Captain. Do maintenance correct the first time. Don't falsify maintenance signoffs and don't lie to crew members about the condition of their aircraft.,,,,CRJ-900 Captain reported the aircraft was refused because the corrective action taken and explanation by Maintenance was unacceptable.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and Maintenance personnel regarding the resolution of aircraft maintenance issues on a CRJ-900 aircraft. The Flight Attendant reported two problems during boarding: a protruding aft cargo L/H blowout panel and a broken upper track guide screw on the forward lav door. Maintenance was summoned, and a Line Mechanic noted that the blowout panel was missing three of four fasteners. A Foreman arrived and assured the Flight Attendant that the issues had been resolved, claiming a new panel had been installed and signed off. However, the Flight Attendant later discovered that the old panel had only been taped in place without the missing fasteners. The Foreman's story changed, claiming the fasteners had been found and reinstalled, but this was contradicted by the Line Mechanic, who admitted no new fasteners had been installed. The Flight Attendant raised concerns, leading to a reinspection by Maintenance, which confirmed the panel was still missing fasteners. A new panel was ordered, and passengers were deplaned and reboarded multiple times due to delays. Despite the replacement, the forward lav door again failed during the flight, with the broken screw reinstalled. Maintenance ultimately installed a new door, but it did not fit properly, causing metal-on-metal contact and difficulty in operation. The Flight Attendant expressed strong concerns about the Foreman's dishonesty and unsafe practices, which could have led to a potential accident. The incident resulted in a 4-hour and 16-minute delay. The Flight Attendant emphasized the need for accurate maintenance signoffs, honesty, and thoroughness to prevent such incidents in the future. The aircraft was eventually cleared for flight after the issues were addressed.",between attendant and crew

After arrival and shutdown at ZZZZ, the flight crew, including the designated operator (the flight attendant) and an observer (the captain), went to the courier area to disarm the entry doors. During the process, the captain noticed the L1 door arming panel handle was already in the disarmed position (green). The flight attendant attempted to arm the door by positioning the handle to armed (red), but the captain intervened, instructing her to return it to the disarmed position. The flight attendant then verified the girt bar flags were out of view. The right side door was also found disarmed, and the captain confirmed both doors were disarmed, announcing ""doors clear."" No further incident occurred after the flight attendant cracked open the L1 door. The cause of the incident was attributed to last-minute departure route changes just prior to departure, which led the flight attendant to not arm the doors and the captain to overlook the manual memo message regarding the doors. The crew agreed that fatigue and distractions could have contributed to the situation. The proposed solution was to ensure a more thorough review of EICAS messages to prevent similar incidents.",between attendant and crew

The gate agents stated that I could not go down to the plane because the security search was being done. I then asked when did that start and the 3 gate agents looked at me as if I was speaking in a foreign language. At XX:18 the gate agent let down my First Officer and said I still could not go down while the security search was being conducted so I then called crew scheduling to notify them as to what is going on. After hanging up the phone one of the gate agents then says to me not every aircraft get a security search. I tell her I'm very well aware that first flights of the day as well as aircrafts that were in a non-secure area receive security searches. I work this same flight serval times a month and no one has ever told me I could not be on the plane while a security search was being done. They then call someone on the phone and a fourth person comes over. They walk me down the jet bridge to 'check' and see if the security search was finished and it is now XX:25; I'm still being denied access to the aircraft. I see the time and state we will not be boarding on time. The male says excuse me and I repeated we will not be boarding on time. He says boarding is 25 mins prior to departure so I tell him my report time is XX:15 not XX:25 I have first flight of the day duties that I need to do and have a report time for a reason. You have denied me access to the aircraft at the time I was supposed to be so we will not be boarding until I'm ready and that's when I was granted access to the plane. As I'm conducting my pre-flight Captain comes and asked me if I was ready and I said no! I literally just got on the plane they are not going to rush me. When I walk back to the front of the plane there are several more people standing on the jet bridge as if they were trying to intimidate me. After the [allotted time] was up for me to charge the floor path lighting I told them I was ready. After the gate agent hands me the paper work she asked could she pull the jet bridge and I tell her no. I make my announcements and conduct the cabin count. When I return to the front to give the Captain the count; there is a slew of gate agents on the jet bridge staring me down.If not being allowed access to the aircraft during a security search is indeed procedure; it needs to be followed daily and not just a random day out of the blue. It should also be applied to all crew members. What is the difference between the pilot and I?

The flight attendant questioned the procedure, as they were unfamiliar with being restricted from boarding during the search. After several attempts to resolve the issue, including contacting crew scheduling and being transferred to a fourth person, the flight attendant was eventually granted access to the aircraft after a 10-minute delay. The delay caused the boarding process to be pushed back, and the flight attendant expressed concerns about the inconsistency in applying the security procedure to crew members. The incident was resolved when the flight attendant was finally allowed on the plane, completing their pre-flight preparations and boarding duties. The flight attendant suggested that if such procedures are standard, they should be consistently applied to all crew members.",between attendant and crew

He asked me to close the cockpit door. As I was trying to close the cockpit door with no success; I continued to try 2 more times; when the Captain shouted angrily! 'Don't slam the damn door.' He repeated it several times; while slamming his hand on the Yoke! 'Don't you ever slam that door again; I'm sick of flight attendants slamming this door.' This was clearly a loss of temper heard by other crewmembers. I stood in fright and shock. After a moment; I told him his outburst was unacceptable and unprofessional for my attempts to close the door. It was then that First Officer explained how the door could be closed. He realized that the door closing mechanism switch (red toggle switch) was not engaged and was preventing me from shutting the door. The door was finally closed; and we departed. There are other events that gave me serious concerns about Captain [name removed].During the flight; the Captain asked for a bathroom break. I was terrified of being alone with him; so I asked another Flight Attendant to stay with me while I stood by the cart barricade.

When he was finished using the lavatory; Flight Attendant [name removed] and myself noticed Captain fumbling with the keypad on the cockpit door; after several attempts; we were concerned.

The Captain became visibly angry, repeatedly shouting at the Flight Attendant not to slam the door, which was witnessed by other crew members. After the Flight Attendant expressed concerns about the Captain's outburst, the First Officer intervened and explained that the door closing mechanism switch was not engaged, preventing the door from closing. The issue was resolved after the door was successfully closed. During the flight, the Captain requested a bathroom break, and the Flight Attendant expressed fear of being alone with him, asking another Flight Attendant to stay nearby. The Captain reportedly attempted to intimidate the Flight Attendant after using the restroom and appeared confused while trying to input the cockpit door code.

Captain failed to warn us of documented turbulence enroute [to] Oakland; failed to keep us seated throughout the flight; and Captain failed to keep us as safe as reasonably possible while performing our inflight responsibilities.Turbulence was both moderate and severe and lasted from the time we began drink service which we were unable to finish past one tray to the time we landed. It is inconceivable how the duration and severity of turbulence would not have been known to the Captain prior to flight. This is a heavily traveled route by both commercial and non-commercial air traffic and it is my understanding that turbulence of this nature should be included in the turbulence plots and weather briefings the Captain is required to obtain and share with his crew prior to departure.Secondly; were there no PIREPs indicating how severe and lengthy the frequency of turbulence was that evening? This is not the only time this has happened. In fact it occurs at [airline] every day practically. Captains in general almost never brief us on weather and when we ask if it will be okay to get up at 10;000 feet to begin service on short flights we are usually told yes. Then; we are bumped and rocked all over the place and never told to sit down until we are in the bad turbulence or the turbulence event has already occurred. We are not being given the weather briefings we deserve prior to flight and Captains are repeatedly not briefing us at all thus compromising our safety.In this particular instance; I woke up this morning with an aching back from the twisting and turning and jarring of my body during the turbulence. The Captain only communicated with us once the event was in full occurrence telling us to take our seats and to remain seated. We were not able to conduct any service beyond the one tray of drinks we in the back were able to distribute. The galley was a mess with spilled drinks everywhere and we were being thrown violently as we attempted to secure the galley.We were unable to collect garbage or secure the cabin for arrival due to the severity and duration of this event. Customers who purchased cocktails from me were never refunded their money because there was no way to do so safely. I ask why it is that the PIREPs of severe turbulence were not communicated to us by the Captain (as is all too often the norm); and why no preflight briefing was conducted by the Captain (also the norm at [airline]) . I also ask why it is we are required to serve drinks on very short flights and how that is considered safe. Some of our flights are barely 50 or 55 minutes block to block. We can't get up until 10;000 feet and must 1. Take drink orders 2. Pour the drinks 3. Balance trays with drinks on them and distribute them; then offer a snack service; conduct trash cleanup; offer seconds on drinks; again do a round of trash; and in addition restock the galleys on many flights. How is this safe?If you do the math the actual time we have to do all this is approximately 20 to 25 minutes and we are not allowed to simply do a water service. It appears safety of flight attendants is not a concern at [airline] as demonstrated by the overall lack of concern and failure of cockpit crews to brief us on matters paramount to our safety and managements disinterest in hearing how unsafe doing a full beverage service is on our shortest flights. When will you; the FAA; step up to the plate and hold our pilots responsible when they do not brief us even when there is an abundance of information available to us and when will you hold Management responsible for their unwillingness to deviate from unsafe practices?,,,,Flight Attendant reported not being informed in a timely manner or at crew briefing about turbulence reported along the flight path.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and the flight crew (Party2) regarding safety practices and communication during a flight. The flight attendant reported that the captain failed to conduct a pre-flight weather briefing or general briefing, did not warn the crew about documented turbulence along the route to Oakland, and allowed the flight attendants to move about the cabin despite severe turbulence. The turbulence, which lasted from the start of drink service to landing, was described as both moderate and severe, with the flight attendant experiencing physical strain and being unable to complete their duties safely. The flight attendant also criticized the lack of timely communication from the captain and questioned the safety practices, such as requiring full beverage service on short flights, which they argued compromised their safety. The flight attendant raised concerns about the captain's failure to brief the crew on known turbulence, the absence of pre-flight briefings, and the systemic issues within the airline, including the lack of action from management and the FAA to address these practices. The flight attendant requested that the FAA hold the captain and management accountable for these unsafe practices and ensure safer working conditions for flight attendants. In summary, the incident stemmed from a failure to provide timely and adequate safety briefings, leading to a hazardous work environment for the flight attendant and highlighting broader safety concerns within the airline.",between attendant and crew

My working position on the aircraft required me to work the top of the meal cart and then spin to assist with the bar cart drinks. When I got far enough down the aircraft with the meals; I left Flight Attendant Y to finish distributing the meals and I then walked up the aisle to assist Flight Attendant X with the bar cart and drinks. I did not even have a chance to get my hands on the bar cart when he carelessly and quickly pushed it down the aisle towards me and struck an arm rest spilling both coffee and tea carafes all over one passenger. Flight Attendant X's hands never left the bar cart. I lunged to try to catch the carafes as they fell; but was unable to help. I immediately apologized to the passenger several times; all while trying to hold the hot soaked part of his sweater on his shoulder away from his skin; trying to pick up the carafes while Flight Attendant X is still shoving the cart onto me. I got up and thought he was assisting the passenger further but no he did not. He continued to push the cart down the aisle and continue service. I twisted my left knee when lunging for the hot carafes. I still thought that Flight Attendant X was attending to the passenger while I was pinned on the other side of the cart. I told him that he needed to slow down three times because he hurt me and the passenger. While in pain; I continued with the service. I had done my best to squat down to the bottom bin and grab a beer for a passenger; just before I stood up Flight Attendant X pushed the cart forward and I struck my forehead and nose on the tray on the cart. He sarcastically stated; 'Oh there you are!' I don't understand why he would push the cart forward when he saw me there. He saw me reach for the beer. I have a bruise on my nose and it hurts when I wear my prescription glasses. Flight Attendant X was aggressive verbally with the passengers and the entire crew but specifically honed in on myself and purser; Flight Attendant Z. We were the only women working the flight. He consistently undermined Flight Attendant Z by disobeying her authority. We had turbulence and Flight Attendant Z; after checking with the pilots on the situation; decided that it was not safe to bring the carts into the aisle. Flight Attendant X specifically ignored Flight Attendant Z's orders and took the cart into the aisle to serve while the remaining flight attendants used pick up pans to distribute drinks.  Flight Attendant X caused an unsafe; and uncomfortable work environment. How am I to react when I learned that he had stated to Flight Attendant A that he was going to 'xx Me Up!'

I have never worked in an environment where I have feared for my safety.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being in an unsafe situation and injured by another Flight Attendant's actions.,"The incident involved two flight attendants, Party1 (Flight Attendant X) and Party2 (Flight Attendant Y). Flight Attendant X was described as acting unprofessionally, recklessly, and aggressively while handling the bar cart. During service, X carelessly pushed the bar cart down the aisle, striking an armrest and spilling hot beverages on a passenger. Flight Attendant Y attempted to assist but was injured when she lunged to catch the falling carafes, twisting her left knee. Despite Y's injuries, she continued to apologize to the affected passenger and attempt to clean the spill. Y also reported being struck in the forehead and nose by the bar cart when X pushed it forward as she was trying to assist another passenger. Flight Attendant X was noted to have disregarded safety protocols, including ignoring Flight Attendant Z's orders to avoid bringing carts into the aisle during turbulence. Instead, X continued to push the cart into the aisle while other flight attendants used pickup pans. Additionally, X was described as verbally aggressive with passengers and the crew, specifically targeting Y and Flight Attendant Z, and undermining Z's authority. The situation created an unsafe and uncomfortable work environment. Flight Attendant Y reported feeling unsafe and feared for her safety after X made a threatening statement, stating he would ""xxx her up,"" which left her feeling afraid and unsure of how to proceed. The result of the incident was a hostile work environment, physical injuries to Flight Attendant Y, and emotional distress.

We had not yet completed our emergency demonstration when we received the single hi-lo chime from the flight deck that we were being cleared for departure. I knew that our procedure in these short taxis was to do the oxygen demonstration after takeoff. However; the Captain had communicated to us that we were expecting turbulence after takeoff; and that he would call us when it was safe to get up. Because of this; I continued with the emergency PA. I then began my final walkthrough; as it was my understanding that this always needs to be done. I had always seen other A flight attendants complete our pre-takeoff procedures even after we had received the single chime. I had reached the back half of the cabin when we started to accelerate into our takeoff. I was able to quickly get into an open seat and fasten my seatbelt; was not hurt in any way; and I returned to my jumpseat when it was safe to do so. Passengers and my fellow flight attendants saw this happen. Our C Flight Attendant was still in my field of view at the front of the cabin after I took a seat; and she rushed to take her jumpseat after we began accelerating into our takeoff. I debated calling the pilots during cruise to let them know that this had happened; but I was shaken up and upset and decided against it. I did bring it up with him while we deplaned at our destination. He was apologetic; and we both agreed that more communication on both of our parts would have benefited. The crew was not told that we would have a short taxi; and I did not communicate with the pilots that we were not ready to take off after we had received the chime. In my experience; it has always seemed like standard operating procedure for the pilots to wait for the A flight attendant to make the 'cleared for departure' PA before initiating takeoff; and if it is not made; for a call to be made to see what was going on in the cabin. The Captain had told me that ATC chatter had interfered with his ability to hear us making our PAs; and he thought we had made the 'cleared for departure' PA. Our C Attendant did ultimately make it after we were already in the process of taking off; and I was in a passenger seat. I consulted my manual when I got home; and did see where it says to signal the flight deck with 2 chimes and inform the pilots that we had not yet finished our emergency demonstration. Then; finish the oxygen demonstration after take off but below 25;000 ft. Again; that was not an option in this case because it was communicated to us that turbulence was expected on our ascent. Then; the manual says to exercise discretion on conducting the final walk through. I had elected to start my walk through after we had received the single hi-lo chime because I was under the impression that the walk through was always required prior to takeoff; and I do not recall being trained to not do it in any circumstances. Again; I had always finished all surface movement procedures before making the 'cleared for departure' PA; and had seen other A flight attendants do the same; even after receiving a hi-lo chime. And; I had never seen a plane take off without a flight attendant making the 'cleared for departure' PA; which is what happened in this case. Ultimately; this was a learning experience that got me to become more familiar with the manual's details in an unfamiliar situation that I had not yet encountered. In the future; I will communicate with the pilots if we are not ready for departure when we receive a hi-lo chime; and determine what procedures should be completed prior to taking my seat for departure. In my case; it was probably something that needed to happen for me to learn. I did not recall learning to not complete my walk through if we had received a hi-lo chime from the flight deck. If one has never been in a situation like this; the manual's language to 'exercise discretion on conducting the final walk through' does not easily connect to areal world situation where that discretion should be applied. It never would have occurred to me that not 'exercising discretion' could result in me being caught in the middle of the cabin during takeoff. Now that I have referred to the relevant section of the manual after this experience; I am prepared to handle this situation correctly in the future; both through more communication with the flight deck as well as my 'discretion.',,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported not immediately seating after receiving pre-takeoff chime notification.,"The incident involved a miscommunication between the flight attendant and the flight crew. The flight attendant, following standard procedures, began the final walkthrough after receiving the pre-takeoff chime, unaware that the Captain had been unable to hear their safety announcement due to ATC interference. As a result, the flight attendant found themselves in the cabin during takeoff, necessitating them to sit in a passenger seat temporarily. Post-incident, the flight attendant and Captain agreed on the need for improved communication and adherence to procedures. The flight attendant committed to enhancing communication with the flight deck and following manual guidelines more diligently in future situations.",between attendant and crew

There was NO PHONE CALL AND NO CHIME OR ANYTHING.. so now safety is involved because if the beverage cart out and being around passengers. I had [the other FA] come back with the cart as quick as she could cause we were closer to landing and when she got back to the front of the plane I had [the other FA] leave the cart in the front and I had told her to take her seat and I will put away the cart as quick as possible. I had a few passengers ask if I needed help but I was not going to put anyones safety in danger due to a pilot error.,,The safety department contacted me to inform me that a communication chime was not received or heard by the flight attendant in the landing phase. This may have led to a situation where a service cart could have been unsecured during landing.The flight was the last of four legs for the flight crew. The transition to this leg was expedited due to some delays impacting the arriving leg. As a result; the flight crew boarded the airplane with the passengers already loaded and the Flight Attendants already onboard. The Captain deliberately stated on multiple occasions to me 'No rush.' To the best of my knowledge; all checklists; SOPs; Chimes; etc. where accomplished completely; deliberately and without rush. To my recollection; the arrival chimes where accomplished; however; there is no aural feedback in the flight deck that I could reference for their accomplishment. To the best of my recollection; an arrival message was given over the PA to the cabin; and all checklists; including chimes; were accomplished per SOP.,,CRJ-900 Flight Attendant and flight crew reported that pre-landing notice was not heard in the cabin and the service cart was not stowed when the landing gear was deployed.,"The incident occurred during the landing phase of a CRJ-900 flight, involving a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and the flight crew (Party2). Party1 reported that they were unaware of the pre-landing chime and had not received a phone call or any notification indicating the deployment of the landing gear. As a result, the beverage cart was still out in the cabin during landing. Party1 instructed another flight attendant to secure the cart as quickly as possible, but due to safety concerns related to the imminent landing, they prioritized securing the cart and ensuring passenger safety. The flight crew, however, maintained that all checklists, including chimes, were completed in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOPs). They emphasized that the arrival chime was broadcasted over the public address (PA) system and that no procedures were rushed despite delays. The incident was reported to the safety department, highlighting a potential communication gap between the flight deck and cabin crew, which could have led to the service cart being unsecured during landing. No specific solution was proposed in the context of the incident.",between attendant and crew

When the flight deck shuts down the aircraft while we are still deplaning passengers and leaves for their layover; it leaves the cabin crew in an unsafe position due to the inability for us to use the cabin inter phone or PA in the event of any type of emergency in the aft section of the aircraft. In essence; we have no way to communicate with the front of the aircraft other than use of the megaphone. In addition; the cabin temperature rises rapidly once the air flow is discontinued making it a health/safety issue for the 100 or more passengers still waiting to deplane.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft was shut down; on multiple occasions; prior to deplaning all the passengers.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant (Party1) and the Flight Crew/Ground Personnel (Party2) regarding the shutdown of a B737 aircraft during layovers. The Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft was shut down on multiple occasions before all passengers had deplaned, resulting in the cabin crew losing communication capabilities (interphone and PA systems), leaving them reliant on a megaphone. Additionally, the cabin temperature rose rapidly due to the cessation of airflow, posing a health and safety risk to passengers still on board. The Flight Attendant suggested that the aircraft should not be shut down until all passengers have deplaned to address these safety concerns.",between attendant and crew

Additionally the passenger reported he saw smoke emanating from the overhead panel in the lavatory. Uncharacteristic of him simply smoking in the lavatory; but possibly something much more serious and potentially life-threatening; an actual aircraft fire. The smoke alarm was activated and projecting an extremely loud and piercing tone throughout the cabin. This caused distress among passengers as well as the FA's. Communicating with the FA's over the interphone was very difficult due to the combined chaotic nature of the alarm and the chaos surrounding its activation. The FA's were having difficulty extinguishing the alarm. I did not know if this was due to continued smoke; or some delay in extinguishing the alarm. Our collective belief was the situation could be much more serious. The FA's asked me for assistance in evaluating the situation. I knew my assistance in the aft of the aircraft would be a departure from our standard protocol. However; based on the information we received at the time; I concluded my assistance might very well mitigate a further degradation in the cabin and secure a safe condition as quickly as possible. The First Officer had demonstrated confidence and technical competence; thus I had no reason to doubt her ability to navigate and control the aircraft; as well as communicate with outside agencies while I assisted the FA's with what appeared and sounded to be a rapidly deteriorating situation. In the interest of time and consequently safety; I elected to personally inspect and evaluate the severity of the incident. I did this in order to determine the most expeditious course of action regarding continuing to [our destination] or turning back.As we were mere minutes from the critical point on our flight plan there was only one FA present in the forward part of the aircraft during the time I exited the flight deck. I shut the flight deck door before the forward FA could enter the flight deck. After working with the FA's to silence the alarm and after inspecting the lavatory and it's overhead panel; I determined there was no immediate threat of an actual aircraft fire; as there was no evidence of heat; burning; or residual smoke. I instructed the FA's to lock the lavatory; and reassess every few minutes. After I returned to the front of the aircraft; I established communication with the First Officer via interphone; and advised her I was ready to return to the flight deck; (after approximately 4-5 minutes). The smoke did not continue; so I opted to continue to [our destination]; as long as the condition didn't reappear. For reasons unknown to me; the First Officer left her seat to open the door rather than pushing the unlock button. About twenty minutes later; the FA's found an electronic cigarette in the toilet that was discarded in what appears to be an attempt to conceal its presence and cause for the smoke. After the passenger (who reported the smoke emanating from the overhead portion of the lavatory) was asked about the device; he did admit it was the cause for the smoke and activation of the smoke detector. I felt in the interest of safety; it was best to leave the flight deck and assess the situation personally; and that would be the most expeditious way to evaluate an overall course of action.At no time during the above events did I intentionally disregard standard procedure; rather I utilized my authority as the Captain to bring the situation to safe conclusion while being mindful of [Company policies].,,,,B737 Captain reported leaving the flight deck to evaluate smoke in the aft lav caused by a passenger's electronic cigarette.,"The incident involved a B737 flight crew responding to smoke in the aft lavatory, which was traced to a passenger's electronic cigarette. Upon notification, the smoke alarm activated, causing cabin chaos. The captain, departing from standard protocol, left the flight deck to personally assess the situation, concluding no immediate fire hazard existed. After extinguishing the alarm and inspecting the lavatory, the captain instructed the flight attendants to lock the lavatory and monitor the situation. Despite the First Officer's departure from standard procedure by opening the flight deck door, the captain returned and decided to continue the flight to the destination. Later, the flight attendants found the electronic cigarette, confirming its role in the incident. The captain's actions prioritized safety, aligning with company policies.",between attendant and crew

FA (Flight Attendant) X was not in compliance the first day of work. [She] was eating out of first class basket before anyone was served; not briefing the exit row before main cabin door was closed and texting once she finished her service. The second day; FA X was working first class. When we arrived in ZZZ with almost a four hours and a half sit; I arrived in the crew lounge and was watching TV. FA X came in shortly after me [while] I was watching TV and texting. I look up and FA X pulls the plug from the TV and I said to FA X why are you behaving like this?FA X said you are not watching TV and I said I was and did not appreciate her behavior and she said she would do again if I turn the TV back on and she did for a second time. This time ripped it out of the wall and I said to FA X you are being disrespectful and to not do that again. She left the room; came back at the same time another crew member came in the room. She had her phone so loud. FA Y said would you please turn your phone down. She said that the volume was on the lowest setting for her phone. FA Y offered FA X headphones. She said they would not work on her phone. The show FA X was watching was using profanity every other word and it was very loud. Any crew member who walked in immediately walked out and sat outside the crew room. FA Y and myself left the room. We both felt very uncomfortable with FA X's behavior. The crew room is supposed to be a place to rest and relax. I did not feel comfortable with FA X's behavior [and] called my manager and explained what had happened and to see if once we arrived [at our destination;] if another FA could take her place. The manager said I know you have high expectations and informed me this was a CRM [issue] and we needed to work things out. Requested at some point to send an email in regards to what happened. When we arrived in ZZZ1; it was late and I was very tired and had an early report the next day. Did not have time to do a report in regards to the CRM. Following our ZZZ sit; I arrived to the aircraft for our next trip to ZZZ1; FA X said we needed to make it through these next 2 days. She was not sure what came over her in the crew room. I agreed with FA X let's work together. We performed our safety demo and part of the demo was to wear the life vest and performed how to wear the vest. FA X would only hold the vest during our demo. After our demo; I mentioned she needs to wear it versus holding it. On the third day of our first leg; FA X was leaving bins half open and the closet door open. This happened more than 8 times and had requested to please make sure they are closed and locked. She would just look at me and walked away. The service cart was left unattended at the exit row. FA X left her service cart and walk to the front galley and called the flight deck. I saw the cart sitting in the aisle at row 12. We did have turbulence on and off during the flight. I walk back to the cart and checked with passengers for service. She was requesting [that] a passenger wanted to purchase Pringles. Prior to FA X making the call to the flight deck; FA X had touched the FA call button twice in a row and I held my index finger to say give me a minute with okay I will be there. I was in the middle of my service with first class.I was not comfortable and felt the safety on the aircraft for the passengers and myself was not safe and FA X would not comply with the safety of the aircraft. I had requested for a manager to meet the aircraft once we arrived at our destination due to the situation through ACARS.I was not sure what the reason was for her calling the flight deck. I spoke to the flight deck in regards to problems of safety in flight. FA X called the flight deck and said I was ignoring her and not helping her on requested items. I explained as before; I was serving first class and [I] would be there shortly. I said to the CA (Captain) [that]there was a communication problem and FA X was leaving bins opened and unlocked service cart left in the aisle at row 12. FA X walked up to [the] galley to call the flight deck and left the cart in the aisle. I requested the flight deck to please notify ACARS there was an issue with safety on board and FA X was not keeping the bins closed and locked; left her cart at the exit row and not talking to me. After FA X's service in the main cabin; she began texting on her phone for the remainder of the flight and would not respond to me.On arrival; two regional managers came to the aircraft to talk and discuss the issues. I had explained to FA X; once all passengers had left the aircraft; a manager would be coming to talk with us in regards to our flight. Before I could address the reason for the call; FA X started the conversation in regards to the incident in ZZZ crew room and made false accusations in regards to what happened to the point of making up things that did not occur. The main reason for the meeting was to discuss the safety issues. I explained the issues of FA X not listening to my request to please lock and close all bins and several occasions to please close the closet door after she opened it to remove an item. The manager asked if we both could work this flight together if not; and you choose not to; you will have a missed trip and a meeting with a manager. FA X said she was okay and I said I had a problem flying with FA X from inflight safety as well making false accusations that did not occur.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that the work environment was very stressful due to the cabin crew pairing.,"The incident involved two flight attendants, FA X and FA Y, on a flight operated by an air carrier. FA Y reported that the work environment became increasingly stressful due to FA X's non-compliant and disrespectful behavior. On the first day, FA X violated protocols by eating from the first-class basket before service, failing to brief the exit row, and texting after completing her duties. The following day, during a layover, FA X disrupted the crew lounge by unplugging the TV, leading to a confrontation. FA X's behavior in the crew room was deemed disrespectful and uncomfortable by other crew members, prompting FA Y to contact management and request a replacement. Despite management's suggestion to resolve the CRM issues, FA Y did not file a report due to fatigue. Subsequent days saw continued non-compliance from FA X, including failing to secure bins, leaving the service cart unattended, and making disruptive calls to the flight deck. During turbulence, FA X was observed texting and ignoring safety protocols, leading FA Y to inform the flight deck about safety concerns. Upon arrival, managers met with the crew, where FA X made false accusations. The managers facilitated a discussion, with both agreeing to continue working together, though FA Y expressed ongoing concerns about safety and false allegations. In summary, the incident stemmed from FA X's repeated non-compliance and disrespectful behavior, leading to a CRM breakdown. Management介入 aimed to address the issues, but FA Y's concerns about safety and accuracy highlighted the need for continued attention.",between attendant and crew

The signal for the cabin to disarm doors is the seatbelt sign going off. We waited about 45 seconds and they still hadn't started disarming doors. I cycled the seatbelt sign in case they hadn't heard it; still no disarming. As the jet way was quickly approaching the door we made a PA for the flight attendants to disarm doors. This is the same crew who didn't check handset the night before until we had done a [return to the gate] for another reason. The same 'A' that had no idea what a security check was or why we did it on first flight of day. Same flight attendant that had no idea why we wear O2 masks when one of us leaves the flight deck.Maybe we should train the new hires in more than 2 weeks so they learn what we used to teach all flight attendants in their class. This in just one example of the many things I see on a daily basis that hardly ever happened a few years ago The training of the new hire flight attendants is only hitting high spots now train them the way we used to so they actually learn something.,,,,An Airbus A320 Captain reported that after arrival the flight attendants did not disarm the doors in a timely manner.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding the delayed disarm of cabin doors after arrival. The flight attendant failed to disarm the doors promptly after the seatbelt sign was turned off, despite a 45-second wait and an attempt by the captain to cycle the seatbelt sign. When no action was taken, the captain made a passenger address (PA) announcement to urge the flight attendant to disarm the doors. This incident highlighted concerns about the flight attendant's knowledge and training, as they reportedly lacked understanding of basic procedures such as security checks and oxygen mask usage. The flight attendant in question was part of a new hire group that the captain criticized for inadequate training, suggesting that the training program may need to be revised to include more comprehensive instruction. The summary concludes with a call for improved training for new hires to address recurring issues.",between attendant and crew

I made appropriate periodic PAs to Passengers. Our wheels up was :50 so I told Agent and Crew to plan to push at :40. At push time no one was ready. I had to go to the top of the jet way to find the Agent and there was no Pushback Crew. As a result we were rushed despite the 50 minute delay. At this point there was a serious chance that we would not make our wheels up time. At the last moment the A Flight Attendant tossed the napkin on to the console and closed the cockpit door. The last digit of the count was illegible and I made the mistake of assuming it was correct. As we approached the runway we were cleared for immediate takeoff. I rang the cabin to notify the Flight Attendants and as we took the runway the A called up to tell us that there was a Passenger that thought he might be on the wrong aircraft. I had the First Officer instruct everyone to remain seated and that we would sort it out in the air. Above 10;000 feet I confirmed the load sheet count of 46 and compared it to the napkin count of 4 (illegible). I contacted the A who said her count was 47. Further investigation revealed that our extra Passenger was a connect for [a different airport] that had failed to exit at the last stop and remained on the aircraft despite the numerous PAs referring to our destination. I suspect that he was in the lav during the through count process. We coordinated with Dispatch to have a [customer service agent] meet him.Slow down; it's always wise to slow down. Also; our procedure of verifying the count as the very last thing to occur before push; seems like there could be a better time to discover this showstopper; especially when faced with a potentially significant delay if an error is detected. Maybe I haven't been paying attention but I ride other airlines and I've never seen flight attendants actually count Passengers before pushback. The potential error chain has too many links with our system.,,[Report narrative contained no additional information.],,B737NG flight crew reported they departed with an unaccounted passenger onboard.,"The incident arose from a miscount of passengers during the boarding process, resulting in an unaccounted extra passenger on board. The flight experienced a 50-minute gate hold after boarding was complete. Despite periodic passenger announcements, the pushback was delayed due to unprepared staff and missing pushback crew. At pushback, the flight attendant provided an illegible passenger count, leading the captain to assume the count was correct. Takeoff was approved, and the cabin was notified. Shortly after taking the runway, the flight attendant reported a passenger concerned about being on the wrong aircraft. The captain instructed everyone to remain seated and planned to address the issue in flight. Upon reaching 10,000 feet, the load sheet showed 46 passengers, while the flight attendant's count was 47. The discrepancy revealed an extra passenger, a connecting passenger who had not exited at the previous stop, found in the lavatory during the count. The crew coordinated with dispatch to have a customer service agent meet the passenger at the destination. The flight had to divert to resolve the issue, causing delays and operational challenges. The extra passenger was offloaded, and the aircraft was prepared for the next leg. The captain suggested revising the passenger counting procedure, possibly conducting counts earlier or more thoroughly to prevent such errors, noting that other airlines may handle this process differently. This incident highlights the importance of accurate passenger counting and the potential benefits of revising current procedures to minimize errors.",between attendant and crew

I directed the flight deck crew to don oxygen masks and set the regulators to 100 percent and established crew communication. I then [advised] ATC and asked for direct [destination]. Shortly thereafter; the Flight Attendants notified us that the device and its spare batteries (which were also in a state of thermal runaway) were contained in the ion battery emergency containment bag and there was no smoke.The device was apparently an e-cigarette. As the device was contained and there was no smoke; I elected to discontinue the QRH. However; the flight deck crew remained on oxygen for the duration of the approach and landing. Approach and landing were uneventful. My biggest concern is that after attempting to notify the Flight Attendants that we were on oxygen; I never called them back. They were making announcements on my first attempt and I simply dropped calling them back off my to-do list. They were surprised when we landed and were surrounded by Fire Rescue.Distraction management continues to be an issue for all flight crews. As a Check Airman; I should have done a better job of communicating. Better use of all my resources would have kept this from happening.

This was a  passenger sitting in 6C; according to my tablet. The landing was good; the passenger was OK. I called the Captain to ask him to stop for a minute so he could get back to his assigned seat; but the Captain didn't answer. We did stop for a while so I told him to return to his seat. 'The Flight Attendant told me I could use the bathroom;' he declared.  Wrong. I checked and none of us said he could - we were landing!The Captain called me back and I told him what had happened and what I had done. After deplaning; the Captain was very apologetic; telling me that Air Traffic Control had changed the runway on them THREE times. I passed on his apology to the crew. Oh; and I think I forgot to dump the coffee before we landed too.  If Air Traffic Control hadn't changed the runway three times; the Captain would have been able to notify us in a timely manner. But...stuff happens.,,,,A321 Flight Attendant reported not receiving the approach announcement from the Captain and only realizing how close to landing when hearing the gear extended. The cabin was not completely secured and a passenger was in the forward lavatory during the landing.,"The incident involved an A321 flight where the flight attendant (Party2) reported not receiving the approach announcement from the flight crew (Party1). This led to the cabin not being fully secured for landing. During the landing, a passenger was found in the forward lavatory, which is against safety protocols. The flight attendant instructed the passenger to stay in the lavatory and brace for landing. After touchdown, the passenger attempted to return to his seat but was initially prevented due to the Captain's unresponsiveness. The flight attendant informed the Captain of the situation, after which the aircraft stopped briefly, allowing the passenger to return to his seat. The Captain later apologized, citing that Air Traffic Control had changed the runway three times, which delayed the timely approach announcement. The passenger was unharmed, and the flight attendant conveyed the Captain's apology to the crew.",between attendant and crew

The ramp agent was right behind her with the pink sheet. We compared the manifest to the pink sheet and entered the numbers for the solution. We overheard the FA talking with the gate agent about missing 30 people. I asked the agent to come forward and explained to her that it's still 10 minutes before departure time. Please go back up the jetway and make sure there's not a bunch of passengers up there trying to get on the flight. We're not going to leave people behind while the door is still open. As this conversation concluded another FA came forward to share his perception. He stated; quite emphatically; 'there's NO WAY that count is right... there are WAY more than 90 people on this aircraft.' He said he was going to do a head count. I thought that sounded like a good idea. As it turns out there were 127 passengers on board; not 90. I walked up the jetway to talk to the agent and calmly explained to her; 'there is obviously a meaningful discrepancy in the passenger count that will need to be reconciled before departure.' That process took about an hour.The passenger count cannot be trusted at this airport. All flights should require a head count to compare to the passenger manifest.,,,,A320 Captain reported that the passenger manifest was incorrect by over 30 people.,"The incident involved a discrepancy in the passenger manifest for an A320 flight. During the boarding process, the ground personnel noticed that the manifest reported 90 passengers, but the actual number of passengers on the aircraft was 127, a difference of over 30 people. The ground personnel raised concerns with the flight attendant, emphasizing the need to resolve the issue before departure. A head count was conducted at the suggestion of another flight attendant, confirming the discrepancy. The ground personnel then informed the gate agent about the mismatch and suggested implementing a standardized head count procedure for all flights at the airport to prevent similar issues in the future. The resolution process took approximately one hour, and the flight eventually departed after the discrepancy was addressed.",between attendant and crew

I attempted to go back to sleep but couldn't due to a galley cart that was parked in front of the door knocking against it every time the aircraft moved from the light turbulence we were experiencing. I got dressed and attempted to exit the bunk but couldn't because of the galley cart parked in front of the door. I waited for the cart to be moved and exited the bunk. The ISM (Inflight Service Manager)/purser and another flight attendant were in the galley. I told them to stop parking carts in front of the bunk door for two reasons; noise from the cart knocking on the door; and we couldn't get out of the bunk in the event of an emergency. [The] flight attendant immediately became argumentative with me. He asked me which manual prevented them from parking a cart in front of the bunk door. He said that it's a galley and that I should expect that kind of noise. He told me to use ear plugs. Here's the best one. He said it's a galley design flaw from Boeing. I gave up after that one. From his argumentative careless attitude towards my concern I was obviously wasting my time trying to fix the problem with this flight attendant. This is a constant issue.In conclusion; I believe that galley carts should not be parked in front of the pilot crew bunk door in the interest of safety. Galley carts banging on the door make sleep impossible and prevent us from exiting the bunk in the event of an emergency.,,,,B787 First Officer reported his rest was interrupted by noises from a galley cart that was parked next to the bunk room door.,"A conflict occurred between a member of the flight crew (Party1) and a flight attendant (Party2) regarding the placement of a galley cart near the pilot crew rest bunk door on a B787 aircraft. The incident was triggered when the flight crew member was unable to sleep due to noise caused by the galley cart colliding with the bunk door during turbulence. Additionally, the cart blocked the exit from the bunk room, raising safety concerns. The flight crew member addressed the issue with the Inflight Service Manager (ISM) and another flight attendant, requesting that galley carts not be parked in front of the bunk door. The flight attendant responded dismissively, challenging the validity of the concern and questioning the relevant procedures. Despite the crew member's efforts to resolve the issue, no agreement was reached, and the problem remained unresolved. In conclusion, the flight crew member emphasized the importance of not parking galley carts in front of the pilot crew bunk door to ensure safety and reduce noise disturbances.",between attendant and crew

We were all waiting at the gate. We saw a mutual friend of ours who was jump seating on our flight. As the passengers were deplaning we started to get our bags ready and the gate agent announces over the intercom for us to 'report to the gate'. We were walking in uniform down the jet bridge. The other crew was leaving in a timely manner. The cleaners were not off yet and the gate agent starts boarding while we are still standing in the jet bridge. We get on the plane and the cleaner would not move to let us put our bags away; mine were still in the FWD doorway blocking the door. I start to preflight without putting bags away and I mentioned to the gate agent; if she could please not board without our permission. The gate agent says in front of the line of passengers 'I'm trying to expedite the boarding process on such a short flight since you guys were late'. Our FO (First Officer) then said; 'you cannot board without our permission we have to make sure our safety procedures are done'. The gate agent mumbled to the passengers who could clearly see we were not ready and were very kind to us. After boarding while waiting for the bag slip the other FA (Flight Attendant) made a comment to the gate agent 'that it wasn't very nice to make a comment like that in front of passengers and if she could ask before boarding?' The response was 'good comment; I may take into consideration' and started laughing and walked away to talk with the other gate agent. She had paged us when we were right in front of her and she was aware of us; and started pushing the lady in the wheel chair right behind us as we entered the jet bridge and asked us if we were ready to board when we hadn't gotten on the plane yet. CRM between gate agents and flight crew requires proper communication and respect by the entire team. I would like to add our crew were all on the same page and our FO was respectfully helping us communicate to the gate agent.,,,,Airline Flight Attendant reported having a gate agent commence passenger boarding before the required preflight safety checks were complete.,"The incident occurred during the final flight of a trip, where the inbound flight was delayed, causing the crew and passengers to wait at the gate. The flight crew was preparing for departure when the gate agent prematurely began boarding passengers before the required preflight safety checks were completed. This led to a situation where the flight attendant's bags were blocking the doorway, delaying the preflight procedures. The flight crew communicated their need to complete safety checks, but the gate agent proceeded with boarding, citing the delay as a reason. The flight crew expressed their concerns, emphasizing the necessity of safety protocols. The gate agent's subsequent actions, including making a comment in front of passengers and displaying unprofessional behavior, further strained the situation. The flight crew remained united, with the First Officer facilitating respectful communication. The incident highlighted the need for improved Crew Resource Management (CRM), stressing the importance of effective communication and mutual respect between flight and ground personnel. The boarding process was delayed, and the incident underscored the necessity for better inter-team communication and respect to prevent future occurrences.",between attendant and crew

She said something about a migraine and rode to the airport with her eyes closed. The ride was very long due to rush hour traffic. During the van ride; the other F/A and I were talking and both thought there was no way she could work. When we got to the airport the van driver pulled me aside and told me I needed to do something about her (both that she seemed sick and she smelled sick) the other F/A and I were able to pull the captain aside and share our concerns and the van drivers comments; even telling him that she was not fit to fly. We shared the same concerns with the lead F/A when we got to the airplane. To my knowledge; neither of them spoke to her; and we began to board. We were rushed during the boarding process; even closing the door with bags in the cabin that needed to be checked. After takeoff when the sick F/A came to the back; she went in the lavatory and proceeded to get loudly and violently ill. Myself and the other flight attendant were left to serve and clean up a full 321 by ourselves.I have had some time to think about this; and am extremely disappointed that I feel our concerns about the ability of a crew member to do their duties was virtually ignored. I know we were in an out station; and removing her from the trip would have caused great delays and customer inconvenience; however; that is exactly what should have happened. An ill crew member is often not a very good judge of their own ability and we have an obligation to look out for each other and act in the best interest of our coworkers and passengers. I do not feel I had the tools to do so. We go to great lengths to outline procedures for ill pax; etc. but those were not applied here. We must not fail at our primary duties in order to protect the operation. Without us doing our duties; there is no operation. We need to feel to feel more empowered to do what we know is right.,,,,A321 Flight Attendant reported another Flight Attendant was obviously ill; but worked the flight anyway. This put additional workload on the remaining flight attendants.,"The incident occurred on an A321 flight where a flight attendant, Party 1, arrived late, was not in uniform, and exhibited signs of illness, including a migraine and a strong odor. Despite concerns raised by the other flight attendant and crew about her inability to work, no action was taken to remove her from the flight. During the boarding process, the crew was rushed, and after takeoff, Party 1 became severely ill, vomiting in the cockpit, which increased the workload on the remaining crew. The failure to address the situation led to operational challenges and highlighted the need for crew empowerment to handle such incidents, ensuring both passenger safety and crew well-being are prioritized.",between attendant and crew

She is incoherent and mumbling.' I told the Lead Flight Attendant that I intended to call Medlink. She then said that we did not need to do that and she would let me know if things got worse. I repeated that I intended to call Medlink and asked her to find out her name; age and if she had taken any drugs or alcohol. I found the appropriate frequency for AIRINC and had them patch me through to dispatch. I then explained our situation to our dispatcher and requested a patch to Medlink. This communication was very broken. We were dropped a few times and dispatch and Medlink had a hard time understanding us. While I was talking to Medlink I called the Lead Flight Attendant back and attempted to get the information and requested she locate a Medlink checklist that past flight attendants have given to me. She said that the lady was now on oxygen and had taken a Motrin and a glass of wine and would be alright and I did not need to contact Medlink. I told her that I was already talking to them and requested the info I had requested earlier. She then stated that there was a language barrier and she could not understand the woman; but she was doing better. I again asked her if she could find out her name and age. The flight attendant then asked if I wanted her to rummage through the passengers belongings. I said no just do the best you can and ask her. She then said that the passenger just wanted to be left alone and was tired. I again asked her to do the best she could and find out the information that Medlink was requesting. She then said 'Here talk to Flight Attendant B' and would not coordinate with me anymore. This flight attendant gave me the seat number and estimated her age. He stated that the passenger was acting like she was really drunk and about to pass out. I asked him if he smelled alcohol on her and he replied no. I relayed this information to Medlink finally. The Medlink Dr. requested that we have the passenger lay on the floor with her feet up.Upon landing I asked our Lead Flight Attendant to debrief our flight with us as I felt that we had a communication breakdown. She said we did have a communication breakdown because she did not want me to call Medlink and I did anyway. I informed her that my calling of Medlink was not her decision to make and that getting the opinion of a trained doctor was the safest course to take as well as relieving us from liability for not seeking out medical help for a sick person. She stated that she has medical training as a flight attendant and that in the future she will not call the pilots until it is a dire emergency and she wanted us to call for help and we will just be out of the loop. I feel this is an unacceptable and dangerous attitude. Medlink is not just for dire emergencies and waiting until someone becomes very sick could have grave consequences for a sick passenger someday.,,,,B737 Captain was informed by the Lead Flight Attendant that a passenger is down in the aft galley; but it is not necessary to contact Medlink at this time. The Captain disagrees and contacts Medlink; which upsets the lead Flight Attendant.,"During the cruise phase, the Captain was informed by the Lead Flight Attendant of a passenger lying in the aft galley, appearing incoherent. The Captain decided to contact Medlink, despite the Lead's advice to wait. This decision led to a communication breakdown due to poor call quality and language barriers, hindering information exchange. Upon landing, the Captain addressed the communication issues, stressing the importance of consulting Medlink for safety and liability reasons. The Lead Flight Attendant responded by stating her medical training and intent to contact pilots only in emergencies, expressing upset over the situation. The Captain deemed this approach unacceptable, highlighting potential dangers. The incident underscores the tension between the Captain's focus on safety and the Lead Flight Attendant's policy on emergency communication.",between attendant and crew

When I returned to the Cockpit to start back to my flight Duties; I was informed from the acting Copilot that they had dealt with an unintentional None Crew Person entry into the Cockpit.  Although shocked; after listening to how it had happened I could see how it might have been able to.  The Flight Attendant misunderstood the FO's request to tell his son that they were passing near Greenland for him to take a look.   When I later went back for a washroom break just prior to the landing at ORD; I also talked with the Flight Attendant about his required procedures with the entry into the Cockpit and the Cockpit Door opening. Also reminded him if he ever felt that a request of that nature is what he heard; he best clarify and to just speak up and ask if that was what was asked of him.  Also knowing his responsibilities and training; to just refuse such a request. Had he just asked to clarify; or refused the request none of this would have happened.,,We were at cruise during the second portion of the scheduled pilot break. The Captain was on his break and myself and the relief FO were in the cockpit. As we were approaching Greenland; I called the forward galley to inform Flight Attendant that the weather ahead was nice with good visibility; since he had asked me earlier if we were going to be able to see Greenland. He asked if he could come up to the cockpit. I told him that would be fine; since this would give me an opportunity to take a lavatory break after he came to the cockpit. He said he would call back when the area was clear and he would be ready. The relief FO then called back to the forward flight attendant station and asked whoever it was that answered the phone if they would inform his son who was riding in the cabin that he look outside his window to see Greenland. Subsequently; the Flight Attendant called to say he was ready and would be at the door. I then went to the door and looked out the door viewing port. It was dark outside the door; but I could see his face as he was close to the door. I didn't see anyone else; as the son was much shorter. I then opened the door and stepped back. At that point; the son had already stepped in and the Flight Attendant was following him into the cockpit. As the door was closing behind them; I recalled our security training which emphasized keeping the door open as short a time as possible (three seconds ideally) and realized the safest thing to do was to close the door and sort it out with the cockpit secure. We then called back to confirm the area was still secure and arranged to have them exit the cockpit as quickly as possible. After discussing the error; it appears to have been a misunderstanding about bringing the boy to the cockpit versus pointing out the view.,,A B767 crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit in flight.,"The incident involved an unintended breach of cockpit security on a B767 flight. During the flight, a crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit due to a misunderstanding. The relief First Officer (FO) requested the Flight Attendant to inform the child to look out for a view of Greenland. The Flight Attendant misinterpreted this as an invitation for the child to enter the cockpit. Consequently, the child entered the cockpit, followed by the Flight Attendant. Upon realizing the oversight, the FO secured the cockpit and ensured the child and Flight Attendant were promptly escorted out. The situation was resolved without further complications. The Captain later addressed the Flight Attendant, emphasizing the importance of adhering to security protocols and clarifying instructions to prevent such incidents in the future. The Flight Attendant was reminded to refuse or clarify ambiguous requests regarding cockpit access to ensure passenger and crew safety.",between attendant and crew

Several passengers at mid cabin and aft cabin were non-compliant of takeoff instructions and the D and B FA were addressing the issue. Securing the cabin was taking a little longer than normal due to non-compliant passengers. Pilots signaled the cleared for takeoff ding. The 'A' flight attendant did not answer and confirm with pilots that cabin was secured due to the fact that flight attendants were still addressing non-compliant passengers. 'A' flight attendant observed aircraft taxi onto runway and immediately went into take off phase. 'A' flight attendant immediately made pa announcement to all flight attendants to take their seats and secure themselves. 'A' flight attendant was not able to notify the Captain in time to delay take off due to sterile flight deck. Captain did not ask for verbal confirmation if cabin and flight attendants were secured. When we landed and Captain was informed of what happen; there was no concern or remorse from his part and when asked why did he takeoff without confirming cleared for takeoff signal from the 'A' flight attendant his response was 'I heard talk so I assumed you were secured.' I feel there was a breakdown in communication between pilots and flight attendants.Breakdown in communication occurred between the pilots and flight attendants and needs to be addressed. A more paced taxi should take place to allow flight attendants enough time to secure the cabin; galleys and themselves in jump seats including performing the emergency demo on a very short taxi especially at smaller airports. And finally we should possibly add to the present response we have in place to the pilots [something to the effect of reminding passengers to check your seat belts and that the cabin and flight attendants are secure.],,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported a takeoff before the cabin was secured due to some noncompliant passengers and no communication with the flight crew.,"The incident occurred on a B737 flight during which non-compliant passengers delayed the cabin securing process, as the flight attendants were occupied with addressing their behavior. When the pilots signaled clearance for takeoff, the 'A' flight attendant, unable to confirm with the captain due to a sterile flight deck, initiated takeoff without confirmation. After landing, the captain's assumption that the cabin was secure based on hearing passenger conversation highlighted a communication breakdown. The flight attendant suggested solutions: allowing more taxi time for cabin securing, adding passenger reminders, and enhancing communication between flight crew and attendants to prevent future incidents.",between attendant and crew

As I was contemplating asking if he needed to use his concentrator during all phases of the flight; I checked my manifest and noticed he wasn't even listed as having an O2 concentrator. As I was about to ask him a question or two; the passenger in 13B asked me if his (12B) O2 bottle ran out; would we have O2 bottles for him to use on board. I almost chuckled as I said 'he's not using O2 from a bottle; it's an O2 concentrator; but we have no info about it even being on board.' She replied that he indeed was using an O2 bottle as he has lung cancer and only 25% use of one of his lungs. I must have had a very odd look on my face as I said 'but he can't bring his own O2 bottle on board an aircraft; totally not allowed!' 'How did you get past the TSA?' She said they discovered the bottle; took it; checked it out; and returned it saying it was okay. My comment was 'they what?' 'So; no one else was informed that you had this and intended to use it on the plane? Turn it off please; now.' I went and retrieved one of our Portable Oxygen Bottles (POBs) and asked the D flight attendant to tell the A flight attendant to notify the flight deck. The passenger in 13B was the girlfriend of the passenger in 12B. She also told me he has used his own POB on many other flights before. She didn't say which airline.Being the C flight attendant; I'm not allowed to be forward of the exit rows for boarding; nor would I leave my cabin area of responsibility prior to takeoff. After takeoff; I'm setting up my cart as the B and D flight attendants are [completing other service duties]. So; not sure how I could have done anything different due to my position. Had I been working a position where I would have seen Mr. [12 B] on what I would have assumed was an O2 concentrator; I would have looked at my manifest to see if he was listed as using one. I would have then asked him if he needed to use it during all phases of flight including takeoff and landing; where I may have asked to move him to a window seat so as not to block/hamper other passengers egress to the main aisle in an emergency. That exchange most likely would have brought about a discovery of an O2 bottle and not a concentrator.I think lesson #1 is never assume a darn thing! Many passengers are not aware they need to disclose plans to use an O2 concentrator and I have watched them come onboard only to discover they aren't listed on my manifest. I then have time to contact an agent to see if they are aware of it and it just hasn't showed up on my manifest yet. I strongly suggest all flight attendants be very aware of passengers using O2 and watch for the device when passengers are boarding; then verify we all know about it. None of that would have mattered in this instance as his O2 bottle was concealed in a small black oblong bag. Boarding an aircraft is a crazy busy time for all concerned. All the more reason to be alert then; as well as any time after takeoff; to things like a passengers using (what should only be) an O2 concentrator and checking to make sure they are listed in our manifest or the proper tag has been placed on it by our agents.,,,,Flight Attendant reported discovering a lung cancer patient inhaling oxygen from a personal bottle not listed on the manifest. The bottle was turned off and replaced with an onboard bottle.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a passenger in seat 12B, diagnosed with lung cancer, used a personal oxygen bottle not listed on the manifest. The flight attendant, initially unaware, was informed by the passenger's girlfriend that TSA had permitted the bottle. Upon realizing the bottle's presence, the flight attendant retrieved an onboard portable oxygen bottle, instructed the passenger to turn off his personal device, and notified the cockpit. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of verifying oxygen device usage and being vigilant during boarding to prevent similar occurrences. The result was the passenger switching to the provided onboard bottle.",between attendant and crew

I ask my First officers (FO) what their plans were for meal service and then shared this with both Purser and the galley person so as have a plan and to work out reasonable expectations. The Relief Pilot did not want to eat until after the first break. Both the First Officer and I said 'if you have our snacks or cold breakfast we will take that now so as to unburden you until after the passenger meal service is complete. Unfortunately only the hot meals were aboard so we all agreed that 45 minute after takeoff (ATO) our food would be put in the oven to be eaten at XA:15 ATO.

Forty-five minutes after takeoff; I called and verified the meals were being heated and he said yes. (XA:30 ATO) about forty-five minutes after the meals being heated I needed to use the rest room and thought this was a good time since the meals should have been ready 15 minutes ago. This would also minimize the cockpit door from being opened and also reduce disturbing the passenger service flow. During this door opening the galley person seemed just a little off and spoke almost too quick to understand and said something about our meals and that he put the wrong ones in but that he had them in now and they needed another seven minutes; I said cool; no worries and the door closed.(XB:15 ATO) Another forty-five minutes goes by and we still have no meals.(XB:45 ATO) I called the galley person and asked about the meals and he said 'we would get them when he was finished with his service' with a firm no-option tone.I immediately called the Purser and informed him the situation and we needed to get our food and was looking for assistance and support from him. It was at this time the Purser stated; 'you need to understand; our procedures; our manual and our training is that the customer comes before the pilot.' I used a firmer voice and said; 'I don't care about the passenger service; we need our food'. Basically his response was sorry that's the way it is! I decided to ACARS Dispatch to get the Duty Manager and an In-Flight supervisor in on the situation. Being refused food and not being contacted or checked in on by the Flight Attendants during the flight (not once) seemed unreasonable; but more importantly it was now deliberate and unsafe. I now realized there was a deliberate 'threat' building here by my very own co-workers and that I needed to address it. I asked to have In-Flight re-assign both the Purser and the Galley person to positions in the aft cabin and to send it over the ACARS. I felt this prudent to defuse the situation and get our food and beverages and that we needed a new Purser and Galley person who understood human physiological needs and 'Safety of Flight' issues. My request was denied by In-Flight operations stating they contractually cannot do that. I sent a message to Dispatch and said ok then I told them I would do it and sent them the details. (XC:00 ATO) Attempting to use 'all resources' to effectively manage this situation; I was going back and forth with dispatch on ACARS for 15 minutes trying to resolve a now serious distraction to the safety of our flight. I am now shocked to find out the Purser actually went on his break and was asleep in spite of my repeated requests for us to have food and knowing this was a major issue. When I called to have the Purser come to the cockpit so I could inform him of the crew position changes I was informed he was on his break and asleep. I am not sure which female Flight Attendant answered the phone but she hesitated when I asked to speak with him; in fact she seemed disturbed that I would call and wake him during his break. At this time I gave a direct order to this Flight Attendant to wake him and have him come to the cockpit with no delay. This was done and the Purser came into the cockpit and I informed him that the company is aware of the situation and that [another Flight Attendant] is now the Purser and that I allowed her to select our new galley person. The original Purser was speechless during my entire briefing as I informed him how both he and the galley person's behavior was appalling; disgusting and unsafe. He didn't respond and was expressionless. It didn't seem to bother him one bit.The Assistant Chief Pilot met the flight and was informed of the situation. He was professional and supportive. A Supervisor for the Flight Attendants then arrived. First Officer from my flight was present. We had a quick introduction and went to the first class cabin where all the Flight Attendants were sitting. Both supervisors were introduced and I went ahead and told them exactly what I thought of their behavior and how it negatively affected the flight. I told both the Purser and the galley person their behavior was disgusting; unprofessional and unsafe. I then repeated to the In-Flight Supervisor what the Purser had said to me: 'you need to understand; our procedures; our manual and our training is that the customer comes before the pilot.' I also explained about the three hours of no food in sight and then asked the supervisor to confirm if the above statement was true and his thoughts.In response; and without hesitation; Inflight Supervisor stated unequivocally: 'That's a true statement.'The Assistant Chief Pilot; did not appear happy with that response from the supervisor and jumped in to explain about 'Captain's Authority.' I was so disturbed by the statement that I informed the [Chief Pilot] was leaving because it was pointless to continue this dialogue. At this moment; I realized this is a much bigger issue.,,,,B-757 Captain described an unsatisfactory working relationship with the Purser and the galley person during an oceanic crossing.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight captain and the purser during a flight. The captain aimed to coordinate meal times with the crew and passengers but encountered delays. Despite his efforts to compromise, the purser prioritized passenger service over crew needs, leading to a breakdown in communication. The captain sought assistance from dispatch, requesting reassignment of the purser and galley person, but this was denied. The purser's unresponsiveness during a critical period further frustrated the captain, who then addressed the issue with higher authorities. However, the situation remained unresolved, highlighting a broader issue within the organization. The summary underscores the importance of balancing crew well-being with passenger service and the need for effective support structures.",between attendant and crew

She informed us that she wasn't in charge of the galley; but would check. We heard back that they would 'need to make some room in the oven' as they were already full with the first class meals. She made mention that she may need to cook them in the back; but since we were boarding she couldn't cook them on the ground. The Captain stated that it was fine; because we didn't want our meals until after we took off. One hour after departure; I called back to query the status of the meals; as I was the non-flying pilot. I spoke with [a flight attendant] who said that the meals had been cooked and she was waiting on a blocker. I called again [20 minutes later] and [the flight attendant] answered the interphone. I told him we had been waiting for our meals for an hour and a half. He stated that [they] didn't have a blocker; as they were finishing cart service in the back and were coordinating to open the door in a few minutes. After parking at the gate I was waiting for the Captain on the jet bridge. [Two flight attendants] questioned him about the crew meals. [One] said that they weren't allowed to interrupt the passenger service to bring us our crew meals. [Flight attendant] then stated that I was 'rude' and 'demanding'. I could hear the entire conversation from the jet bridge. The Captain stated that we coordinated on the ground for the meals after take-off and they should have been brought to us sooner. Being forced to wait for meals is a safety issue and we shouldn't need to call back multiple times to question the status to take us away from our flying duties. Furthermore; I think it was unprofessional for [the flight attendants] to question the Captain about his request for the meals early and complain about the First Officer while the passengers were deplaning. It causes me concern and makes me question [whether] direction by the cockpit could have been followed in an emergency.,,,,B737 First Officer reported difficulty getting the flight attendants to bring up crew meals in a timely fashion.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding the timely delivery of crew meals. The Captain requested the meals after takeoff, but the flight attendant indicated the galley was busy preparing first-class meals, suggesting they might be delayed. An hour later, the First Officer inquired about the meals and was told they were ready but needed a blocker. Upon follow-up, the flight attendant mentioned they were finishing passenger service. Post-landing, the Captain was approached by attendants who questioned the meal timing. One attendant criticized the First Officer, prompting the Captain to express concerns about professionalism and crew coordination during emergencies. The delayed meals were seen as a safety issue, affecting crew duties and raising questions about emergency preparedness.",between attendant and crew

I did my PAX count and handed it to the pilots; just as I was about to head back to the rear of the plane the gate agent stopped me. He then handed me two; what looked like boarding passes and said that I needed to upgrade YYD to ZZD; as she was next on the upgrade list; and also pointed out that the other paper was an interrupted travel itinerary for PAX XXD. He then told me that the PAX in XXD may have had a bit too much to drink earlier so keep an eye on him. I asked the agent if he was going to be an issue and he said that he should be fine but wanted to give us a heads up just in case. I then upgraded the PAX in YYD to ZZD and checked on the PAX in XXD and he appeared to be fine. I had no issue with him and he did not cause a scene or anything else. I then went back the aft galley and called the FA-A and told them to make the CA aware of the situation of the PAX in XXD; but to also let him know that there were no problems and we felt fine taking him with us on the flight. The PAX slept for most of the flight and did not want any snack or beverage during flight. Once we landed the PAX in XXC told FA-A as he was deplaning that the PAX in XXD had urinated in the seat during landing and was wiping the seat down as he left. FA-A told the CA and the CA called for hazmat to come clean the seat. When cleaning/doing seatbelts both I and the other FA did not touch seats XXC/D and also warned the incoming crew.My main concern is not the possibly intoxicated PAX as he was fine there were no issues at all. I'm mainly concerned about how the gate agent handled this situation. He never made the crew or CA aware of this PAX until just before shutting the main cabin door. We as a crew never had a chance to discuss the situation until it was thrown at us right as the Main Cabin Door (MCD) was being closed. These type of situations should be brought to our attention as soon as possible. Again I want to say my main concern is with the gate agent not handling this situation properly.,,,,EMB175 Flight Attendant reported being informed by the Customer Service Representative as the main cabin door is closed; that a passenger they boarded is intoxicated but shouldn't pose a problem. He did not; but the passenger seated next to the possibly intoxicated passenger informed the Flight Attendant during deplaning that the possible intoxicated passenger urinated in his seat during landing.,"An incident occurred on an EMB175 flight involving a flight attendant and ground personnel. The flight attendant completed the passenger count and handed it to the pilots. A gate agent approached them with two boarding passes: one for an upgrade request (YYD) and another for a passenger (XXD) with an interrupted travel itinerary, noting that XXD might have been intoxicated. The flight attendant upgraded YYD and monitored XXD, who appeared fine during the flight. Upon landing, passenger XXC informed the flight attendant that XXD had urinated in the seat during landing. The captain was alerted, and hazmat was called to clean the area. The flight attendants avoided the affected seats and notified the incoming crew. The flight attendant expressed concern about the gate agent's handling of the situation, stating that the crew was only informed just before the cabin door closed, leaving them unprepared. The primary issue was the lack of timely communication from the ground staff. The flight attendant suggested that ground personnel should inform the crew about such situations as soon as possible to ensure preparedness.",between attendant and crew

Had no official pickup time from hotel so went down at XA:05 local for a XB:47 departure to be sure we were on time. After about 40 minutes in lobby; saw a car from company which does our transportation dropping off a crew. Went out and asked if he was our ride to airport. He said no; but our ride would be there. Later; hotel employee asked if I was Captain X; I said I was. He said operations was on phone and wondered where we were. Replied still waiting for airport ride. He took contact information and called ride service. The problem was scheduling never arranged for ride to airport with re-assignment. Finally got ride to airport. Apparently; an announcement had been made; flight delayed due to pilots not showing up. True; but only because Scheduling hadn't done their job getting us transportation. Got on plane; first thing FAs say is they're 'pissed.' Don't ask what happened; just start yelling at us. Only FA A showed any professionalism; listened to flight brief etc. even after situation explained to FAs B and C. FA D never even showed his face. Our position and authority were totally undermined by company and FA behavior. Only FA A could have been counted on in an emergency. Shouldn't have even left the gate looking back on it. Only trying to make right by passengers drove us to continue. Both B and C made very disparaging comment upon their arrival to plane. An explanation of circumstances changed nothing. FA D totally pretended we didn't exist. Upon leaving plane I said see you to D; he said; 'oh yeah; you will see me.' Was this some sort of threat? We didn't even feel comfortable eating our meals; fear they'd be tampered with considering the FA vitriol. This wasn't a safe flight; and in fact we were working in a very hostile environment. Somebody at the Company failed to do their job; and it was blamed on the pilots. The safety of this flight was very impaired by the actions of FAs B; C; and D. And perhaps by whomever at the company didn't own up to their error; and blaming us. But the FAs need to be professional; even if it would have been our fault; which it wasn't. They compromised safety.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported being rescheduled during a layover; but the scheduling department failed to set up transportation resulting in a late arrival at the aircraft. The flight attendants are furious at the delay and are not interested in what caused it. The Captain believed that the safety of this flight was compromised by the attitude of the flight attendants.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight crew and three flight attendants (FAs) due to a scheduling mishap and subsequent professional misconduct. The flight crew was reassigned to an earlier flight without timely transportation arrangements, causing a delay. They waited 40 minutes for a ride, which was eventually arranged but led to the flight being delayed because the crew was late. Upon boarding, FAs B, C, and D displayed anger and hostility towards the crew without listening to their explanation. FAs B and C yelled and made disparaging comments, while FA D ignored the crew. Only FA A remained professional. The crew felt their authority was undermined and safety compromised by the FAs' behavior. They were uncomfortable, fearing potential tampering with their meals and feeling threatened by FA D's comment. Despite the hostile environment, the crew continued the flight to ensure passenger comfort, though they were uneasy.

I was the A Flight Attendant (FA) so I made an all call to the crew to see if they smelled it also. All flight attendants smelled a strange odor. The front smelled like musty socks and the back smelled like parmesan cheese. I called the captain to tell him about the smell and he said they smelled it as well but they were climbing higher and thought it would dissipate. The D-E-H were all sitting in the forward galley with me. We all had headaches and distorted vision. Soon afterwards; I called the back galley to see if the odor dissipated; it didn't and was informed that our one pregnant (F) Flight attendant was being put on Oxygen. I called the captain to tell him that (F) was on oxygen and while I was on the phone I was informed B-C-F were all on Oxygen. I told the captain we didn't feel safe continuing. He said they were turning the plane around. I got up to go check on the FA's in the back and immediately felt light-headed and caught myself on the jumpseat. The E flight attendant told me to sit down and we got the oxygen bottles down and we were sharing the two bottles between the four of us. We were in the air for about 50 mins total. We landed at XA:14. Upon landing no one in inflight met our aircraft. The 'B' FA called crew service center and within 15 minutes inflight showed up to check on us. We told the inflight supervisors that we wanted to have blood tests run for Carbon Monoxide poisoning. They arranged for transportation to see a company doctor. We arrived there at XC:00. The company doctor said that he couldn't do the blood test. We were involved in many company calls through-out this ordeal and taxis were arranged for us to go to the hospital to get the blood test done. I was never seen by the company doctor since the taxis were on their way to take us to the Emergency Room (ER). A Manager showed up and about an hour later the taxis came. We arrived at the Hospital [5 hours after landing]. We saw the gate agent; who met our flight; in the ER waiting room; who didn't feel well; and we were informed also that three of our passengers needed treatment. The ER process was very fast and had blood drawn to check our CO levels. The doctor informed us that we should have been admitted soon after getting off the airplane. The test results will be forwarded to the company. According to Station Maintenance they washed the left engine the night before and were supposed to let it run for 10-20 minutes as procedure dictated; but the proper time wasn't allotted.I suggest during a fume incident that it should be company policy that you go straight to the ER for CO testing.I suggest that maintenance not take shortcuts when it comes to crew & passenger safety.,,We opened the auxiliary kit and put on masks. It was decided that the F needed to go on oxygen immediately as she is 5 months pregnant and we did not know what kind of fumes we were inhaling. Within 10 minutes from the beginning of the smell; we had 2 more bottles of oxygen between the other 3 of us in the back (B; C and G). The G decided not to use oxygen.Upon landing and deplaning we were not met by any manager; supervisor or paramedic. We had to call to ask someone to meet us. We were told by our pilots (who received information from the engineers); that the planes left engine had been cleaned the night before and 'may' not have had the engine run for 10-20 minutes to burn off chemicals; even though that is protocol after engines are cleaned.At this point; I was extremely disoriented; my eyes burned and I had a splitting headache. We all wanted to see a doctor and have our CO levels tested. Shayna began making calls and arranged for [medical] to pick us all up. It took over an hour between getting off the plane and being picked up to be checked out by the company doctor.We found out shortly after arriving at clinic that they would be unable to perform the blood test we needed done. At this point we were trying to get [ground] to take us someplace that could do the test. A Manager showed up and said taxis were on their way. It took about an hour and a half to be shuttled to the hospital.Once at the hospital; we were all admitted extremely quickly. Once I met with the doctor; my blood was drawn and tested for CO levels. The doctor told me it was most likely to come back with normal levels because of how long it had been since our exposure to the toxic fumes and that we should have been tested within a few hours. The test results will be forwarded to the company.There needs to be a very specific protocol for when there is a toxic fume event. We should NOT have been sent to [company medical provider]. They were extremely unprofessional and were unable to perform the test we needed done. Hours were lost spending time there and getting transportation to a location that was able to do the test.,,After takeoff; A330 flight attendants detected a strong chemical odor similar to 'spoiled eggs and vomit' which physiologically affected the crew and passengers. The flight returned to the departure airport. Post flight medical examinations revealed physiological symptoms; but blood tests samples were hours delayed and inconclusive.,"The incident involved a flight where a strong chemical odor, described as resembling spoiled eggs and vomit, was detected shortly after takeoff. This odor led to physiological symptoms such as headaches and vision issues among the flight attendants and passengers. The flight was subsequently turned around and returned to the departure airport. Upon landing, the crew experienced delays in receiving medical attention, as the initial medical provider was unable to conduct necessary blood tests promptly. The ground personnel indicated that the odor may have originated from the left engine, which had been cleaned the night before but not run long enough to eliminate fumes, as per protocol. The flight attendant suggested improved protocols for carbon monoxide testing and against maintenance shortcuts, while the ground personnel emphasized the need for specific procedures and criticized the delayed medical response. The medical tests conducted hours later were inconclusive due to the delay.",between attendant and crew

On the first night all three flight attendants were placed on separate floors; causing unsafe hotel conditions. The problem was only fixed the next night after I; as A Flight Attendant; asked that it not happen again. Although the Captain did state during his briefing that safety was most important; he failed to communicate when there was turbulence. I understand that there are times when it comes on unexpectedly but when it did come on he would not switch the seat belt sign on until we called up to have it done; and did not call back to alert or inform us. He also opened the flight deck door to use the restroom without informing the flight attendants so that we could pull out a cart to block off the aisle. There was a pilot jumpseating in the flight deck; but blocking protocol should still have been followed. I quickly pulled a cart out when I saw him and blocked off the aisle as per procedure. During the last flight of the night we were experiencing extremely moderate turbulence; due to the storms on the East Coast; and as A Flight Attendant I determined that it was unsafe for the B and C flight attendants to be out in the aisles at all; let alone with a cart; so the C Flight Attendant called up to the Captain to ask if he could make an announcement that the last water and coffee service of the night would be canceled. When he did he told the passengers to ring their call button if they needed anything. While the flight attendants in the back were still experiencing turbulence the Captain asked for coffee; which is a hot beverage. As the water was shut off in the front galley the only coffee was in the back where they were experiencing the brunt of the turbulence that was already communicated to the pilots. Several landings were more rough than necessary; one caused several passengers in the cabin to scream; while another got aborted by ATC for coming in at the wrong angle. We had to re-ascend and do it over. We also had an on ground delay during the trip; and the Captain failed to update the passengers every 15 minutes as per protocol. When I asked him if there were any updates he was very short with me.It would seem to me that most of these problems could be solved by this pilot communicating better. The conditions of this trip were such that the flight attendants felt as though lines of communication were lacking between the Captain and cabin crew. This creates an unsafe work environment when the cabin crew does not feel comfortable communicating their conditions to the flight deck. On several occasions throughout the trip the flight attendants expressed to me their feelings of un-safeness. If an emergency were to happen we weren't sure that we would be given all the information we would need to properly keep passengers and ourselves safe.,,,,An A320 Lead Flight Attendant reported a Captain's poor communication skills made the crew feel unsafe after he refused to turn the seat belt sign ON during turbulence; disregarded the cabin crew's other requests and then requested hot coffee during turbulence. Poor landings and a go-around also contributed to the sense.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the captain regarding communication and safety protocols during a flight. The flight attendant reported that the captain demonstrated poor communication skills, which led to unsafe conditions for the cabin crew. Specific issues included the captain failing to promptly activate the seatbelt sign during turbulence, disregarding requests from the cabin crew, and requesting hot beverages during turbulent conditions. Additionally, the captain did not follow proper blocking protocols when using the restroom, and several rough landings, including an aborted landing, occurred. The flight attendant also noted that the captain did not provide timely updates to passengers during an on-ground delay, despite protocol requiring updates every 15 minutes. These incidents created a sense of insecurity among the cabin crew, as they felt communication lines were inadequate, potentially compromising safety in an emergency. The flight attendant suggested that improved communication between the captain and cabin crew could address these issues.",between attendant and crew

No inop or deactivated label was present by this CB and no documentation in the logbook could be found regarding this CB so Maintenance was notified. After Maintenance researched the aircraft's history no reason could be found for the CB to be open so the Mechanic closed the CB and signed off the corresponding logbook entry I had written. It is unknown how long this aircraft had been operating with this CB collared.Second; I was informed by the Purser that the aft galley had no electrical power so the utility bus switches were cycled to reset the system and I called a flight attendant in the aft galley to confirm if the galley had power. I was told the power was on and no mention was made of any open CB. I informed the Purser the aft galley power was on. Much later and just prior to departure I was informed that that the forward galley had no electrical power (in spite of the fact the First Officer had requested a cup of coffee some fifteen minutes earlier prior to departing on this all night flight). My experience and intuition dictated an inspection of the forward galley where I immediately discovered two forward galley CBs open. Again Maintenance was notified. The Mechanic informed me that earlier he had opened both the forward and aft galley CBs for reasons I do not fully understand but not related to any aircraft airworthiness or mechanical issue. The Mechanic reset the forward galley CBs and normal galley power was restored.Third; I then needed to confirm the aft galley was powered and if any crew member had reset the aft galley CBs. Power was normal and when asked directly about open CBs a flight attendant admitted that a flight attendant had reset the CBs. I asked him to come forward and we stepped onto the jet bridged where I discretely counseled him that he must never reset a CB and always inform the Captain of any CB that might be found open. The flight soon departed and upon arrival at our destination; as the crew deplaned; I asked three of the flight attendants what they believed should be done if they find a CB open. Their confident consensus was that they could reset the CB one time while on the ground and that notifying the Captain was not required. I informed them of the correct policy but they persisted that their rules allowed them to reset a CB. I further explained the policy was for safety reasons and that I was not authorized to ever reset a CB. I encouraged them to research the issue.It appears many flight attendants may not understand our CB policy and their responsibility to inform the Captain of aircraft discrepancies. Specifically; I recommend an immediate system wide electronic message to all flight attendants reminding them of the CB policy and their responsibility to inform the Captain of all maintenance related issues. Additional periodic training also seems to be required for all flight attendants. Note: On other flights; I have had flight attendants bypass me WHEN I'M PRESENT to inform Maintenance of an issue and only later do I happen to learn of the problem; and have been told by flight attendants pre-departure that: 'you can write it up when we get to our destination' as if they have that authority. Initiative by flight attendants to notify appropriate agencies for support should not be discouraged when the flight crew is not present but they should be reminded that they still have the responsibility to insure the Captain is informed.,,,,A B757-200 Captain utilized the occasion of finding an open and banded Circuit Breaker (CB) during preflight to address what he believes to be diametrically opposed understanding of undirected CB operation between flight crew and cabin staff. He further addressed what he believes to inappropriate direct flight attendant/maintenance interface without prior consultation with the Captain.,"During the pre-flight preparation for a B757-200 flight, the Captain discovered an open Circuit Breaker (CB) with a red collar in the potable water system. No documentation or labels indicated a known issue with the CB, so Maintenance was notified. After researching the aircraft's history, Maintenance found no explanation for the CB being open and closed it, signing off in the logbook. Later, the Captain addressed issues with galley power and discovered two forward galley CBs open. Maintenance explained they had opened and closed the forward and aft galley CBs earlier for unclear reasons, unrelated to airworthiness or mechanical issues. The Captain was concerned about the lack of communication regarding these actions. Upon further investigation, the Captain learned that a flight attendant had reset the aft galley CB without informing the Captain. The Captain discreetly counseled the flight attendant on the proper procedure to report any CB issues. After the flight, the Captain questioned other flight attendants about their understanding of CB policies. Their responses indicated a lack of awareness, as they believed they could reset CBs once without notifying the Captain. The Captain emphasized that flight attendants should always inform the Captain of any CB issues and highlighted the importance of adhering to safety protocols. The Captain recommended implementing a system-wide electronic message to remind all flight attendants of the CB policy and their responsibility to report discrepancies to the Captain. Additionally, periodic training was suggested to reinforce these procedures. The Captain also expressed concern about instances where flight attendants bypassed the Captain to communicate directly with Maintenance, even when the Captain was present.",between attendant and crew

I stopped the passenger from going to seat and asked where he put the cigarette. He denied it of course and when he opened his mouth it was as if a cloud of smoke came out. The smell was so strong. I had him stand in galley while I searched the LAV with the door opened. I opened the trash bin and pulled out the compartment. There was a bunch of paper towels and one Budweiser can (he had been drinking that). I pulled can out and smoke was coming out of the can. I called for the other Flight Attendant to get me a bunch of bottles of water while I put the can under water in the sink. I poured about 4 bottles into the can to ensure there was no possibility of a fire. He still continued to deny he did anything; but I said you were the only one drinking Budweiser and you were the only one in the LAV in the last half hour. I told him to give me his ID and go to his seat. He said 'can I talk to you?' To which I replied 'give me your ID take your seat and I will speak to you later.' Flight Attendant B notified A; who notified the Captain. Flight Attendant A made another no smoking announcement. I copied his information and filled out crewmember report of smoking. I gave him the bottom portion which notifies him that the incident will be reported to FAA. I also returned his ID. He started to say something and I stopped him. I said to him that he needed to really think about what could have happened to all of us on the aircraft because of his irresponsible and dangerous action. Had we not caught this immediately; I can't even imagine. He then pretended to sleep the remainder of the flight. The smoke detector did not go off.

Flight Attendant B noticed the odor, confronted the passenger, and discovered a smoldering cigarette inside a beer can. She extinguished the cigarette by submerging the can in water and notified the other flight attendant and the captain. Flight Attendant A made a subsequent no-smoking announcement, and the passenger was required to provide his ID and return to his seat.

I was the #4 Flight Attendant this flight. At around 500 FT before landing I looked over at the Number 2 Flight Attendant on this flight and we both just stared at each other and then looked outside to see where we were to touching down. I knew we were too high to land and that our landing did not feel normal. The plane started to sink; and we heard the engines being pushed to throttle and we thought the pilot was going to possibly attempt a go-around. We hit the runway incredibly hard bounced up in the air and then I felt the right wing tip way to way close to the ground. I was actually looking outside to see just how close we were to hitting the wing tip and rolling over. At this point the plane was sideways and was squirreling all over the place. I thought we were going to have a crash landing. After we got to the gate at no time did the pilots call back and see if we were ok. The pilots at no time made a P.A. to the people about what had just happened. After the passengers deplaned and we got up to the flight deck; myself and the Number 2 Flight Attendant; we asked the Number 1 Flight Attendant where the flight deck was. Number 1 stated the Captain told her; 'I can't believe I almost crashed this plane and took off outside to look at the plane'. After our 2nd terrifying landing in 2 weeks on another 737; and not being able to talk to our Captain or First Officer; the Numbner 2 and I removed ourselves from our last two legs of our trip. We both were shook up. This was our 2nd unreal and terrible distressing landing in 2 weeks. On both of these incidents the weather did not play a factor. It was sunny and warm. On our flight back to base one of our 737 Captains had just finished his recurrent training. We had both flown many times together without such incidents taking place. He was the only pilot to give us some possible explanations. One; on the earlier incident; the Captain was new to the left seat and needs additional training. Or two it was a max flaps 40 involvement. He explained that some pilots like to practice using the 40 setting; when it really is only supposed to be used on short runways like LGA; DCA; and BOS. At our meeting; the Chief Pilot was initially in the meeting and told my friend and I that; 'this would happen again.' This statement was shocking to us because we have both flown this plane many times without these terrible landings taking place. It should be noted that for many years both Number 2 and I have flown the 737 and every plane this airline has had and never had any landings like these last two.This incident was on our first trip of the month. The earlier event; we had completed a turn I was the Number 4 Flight Attendant; and my friend was the Number 2 Flight Attendant on this flight. This was a really terrifying landing. The Captain came on the P.A. and told us and the passengers that it was 84 degrees and the wind was 5 MPH. He then told us to prepare for landing. My friend and I prepared the cabin and did our final cabin checks and took our jump seats and belted in. We first started to feel our plane did not feel right as we were around approximately 1;000 FT. We looked at each other and looked outside to see how close we were getting to touching down. As we stated to get closer to landing we both knew that everything about this landing did not feel normal; the position of the plane and the attitude. We hit so hard the plane bounced 8 to 9 feet; slammed down again on the runway and we bounced another 5 feet; and then our planes wings tipped so low to the ground; they went right to left and I told my friend to 'cover her eyes.' We both felt the plane was going to crash. After we got to the gate again the pilots never came on to talk to the passengers or to us the crew. By the time the Number 2 and I got up to the flight deck the Captain was gone. My friend spoke to the First Officer; and asked; 'what just happened; what was the landing all about?' The First Officer replied something about the winds; and my friend said no; there was no wind. Then the First Officer told my friend 'that the Captain was fairly new to the left seat'. This was a terrifying landing.,,The event occurred because the pilot lost wind. He was going to do a go-around but decided to land the aircraft because he was lined up. However; we were still too high when he landed and we knew he was making a decision when we heard the engines flare and then we dropped down around 50 feet to the ground.We are the eyes and ears of this operation so everyone says. However; when we have negative issues to discuss most pilots leave us hanging with unresolved answers and emotions. Yes; we are able to feel when things are off with the engines; landings; weather. If the only thing the pilot is worried about is his aircraft and not his crew; we have a long way to go. A pilot that clearly knows that an incident occurred should at the very least call back and make sure that his crew is ok. If he could provide information as to what happened; would be great. Everyone says the back of the B737 feels totally different from the front of the aircraft and it's true.,,Two B737-800 Flight Attendants report a Captain; apparently new to the left seat; lost control of the aircraft in the flare and made a very hard landing which resulted in two bounces before coming to stop.,"The incident involved two hard landings on a B737-800 aircraft, experienced by two flight attendants during separate flights. In both cases, the landings were described as abnormal, with the aircraft feeling unstable and the pilots failing to communicate effectively with the cabin crew or passengers afterward. The first landing occurred during final approach, with the aircraft feeling too high before touchdown. The plane bounced upon impact, with the right wing tip nearly touching the ground, causing concern among the flight attendants about a potential crash. After the incident, the pilots did not address the crew or passengers, leaving the flight attendants unsettled. The second landing was similarly hard, with the aircraft bouncing multiple times and the wings tilting dangerously low. The flight attendants reported that the captain, who was apparently new to the left seat, lost control during the flare. After landing, the captain did not communicate with the crew, and the first officer mentioned the captain's inexperience as a possible contributing factor. Both incidents occurred under clear weather conditions, with no apparent external factors. The flight attendants expressed frustration over the lack of communication from the pilots and the unresolved nature of the incidents. They also noted that the captain may have been practicing with max flaps 40, which is typically reserved for short runways, as a potential factor in the hard landings. The flight attendants removed themselves from their duties following the second incident, citing the traumatic nature of the events and their concern for safety. The chief pilot acknowledged the issue but did not provide a definitive resolution, leaving the flight attendants shaken and uncertain about future flights. The attendants suggested that the captain, who was new to the left seat, may require additional training, particularly regarding the appropriate use of flaps during landing. They also emphasized the need for better communication between pilots and cabin crew in the event of an incident.",between attendant and crew

We immediately started take off as I ran to the back to reach my jumpseat with my equipment in hand. I turned around to secure a door coming open and was thrown against the back galley. I dropped my equipment and immediately tried to secure myself which was hard with the force of take off. We were in the air before I was able to buckle in. I think the flight deck should wait for cabin secure before take off is allowed. I understand though that they have a lot going on as well.,,At the end of emergency demo; we heard the 'clear for departure' chime. I was unable to do the final walk-trough. Almost immediately after the chime; we began take off. I did not even have the opportunity to make the; 'we have been cleared for departure' PA and we were already in the air. I was able to get to the jumpseat but struggled to buckle the harness.,,Two B737 flight attendants describe a takeoff while they are standing in the isle; having not completed their final walk-through and takeoff PA.,"The incident occurred during the takeoff of a B737 aircraft when both the flight crew and cabin crew encountered unexpected challenges. The cabin crew had not completed their final safety checks and announcements when the 'clear for departure' chime sounded. As a result, the cabin crew was still in the aisle when the aircraft began takeoff, leading to one flight attendant being thrown and struggling to secure their harness. The flight crew also faced difficulties as a flight crew member was thrown against the galley, dropping their equipment. The cause was the cabin crew's inability to finish their safety procedures before takeoff. The process involved the premature initiation of takeoff without the cabin being secure. The result was a safety concern due to the crew's struggles during takeoff. A proposed solution was for the flight deck to wait for the cabin to be secure before allowing takeoff.",between attendant and crew

I notified the captain. On the CRJ-700; the main cabin door is the main source of egress in an emergency evacuation.  The configuration of the stairs on the inside of the cabin contain instructions for properly closing and opening the door.  In an emergency where the flight attendant is incapacitated; passengers must open the door.  The stairs on this aircraft were installed incorrectly and the instructions; placards; emergency lights and instructions are in the incorrect place; thereby potentially causing a delay in evacuating the aircraft in the event of an emergency.  Incorrect configuration of the main cabin door. This issue would have caused multiple cancellations and delays; however; I would insist on contacting Maintenance and checking the procedures before completing the flight.,Reporter stated that two of the raised steps on the main cabin door were not reinstalled to their original positions during a C-Check; after the main door had been reconnected to the CRJ-700 aircraft. With the door in the 'open' position; the second raised step from the bottom was swapped with the third step. The second step has a recessed handgrip in the step plate that is used to pull and guide the door during latch handle closing; opening and during emergency exiting. The third raised step from the bottom has placards for exit; door open/close procedures; emergency open procedures; and an emergency light. The steps were out of sequence.Reporter stated the Captain would not call Maintenance or write-up the incorrect step configuration due to lack of company Maintenance at the stations they were flying to. Other flight attendants told her the same condition had also been found on their CRJ-200 series aircraft; but no one was correcting or taking the situation seriously.  Contact was made with a Maintenance Manager who pulled the aircraft from service within three hours after being made aware of the situation. The discrepancy was corrected. Maintenance Manager noted that mechanics and Quality Assurance had missed the incorrect step configuration during reinstallation of the door. Reporter doesn't know if that issue has been addressed.,,,A Flight Attendant reports the steps on the Main Cabin Door of a CRJ-700 aircraft were incorrectly configured during a Maintenance C-Check.

The misconfiguration affected the door's handgrip, instruction placards, emergency lights, and exit procedures, potentially hindering emergency evacuations. Upon discovering the issue while closing the cabin door, the Flight Attendant informed the captain and insisted on contacting Maintenance and reviewing procedures before the flight could proceed. This action ensured the problem was addressed, preventing potential delays or cancellations. The proposed solution was to engage maintenance and verify procedures, which was implemented to resolve the issue.",between attendant and crew

Flight Crew reported to Maintenance a squeal in the cabin during Deadhead to ZZZ1. Line Maintenance arrived to investigate and requested Flight Crew to start engines with [Main Cabin] door shut. After listening in the cabin at normal pressure levels on the ground; Maintenance put aircraft pressurization system into manual mode and descended the cabin until reaching 3.0 psi and back to unpressurized; approximately 15 minutes. Crew experienced uncomfortable ear pressure but no other medical concerns. Maintenance tightened a connection in Pack-1 and Aircraft returned to service. In ZZZ; the following morning; Captain obtained a copy of the Maintenance procedures including the BOLD WARNING about non-essential personnel not being onboard. This pressurization took the flight crew to a cabin altitude below sea level; there is concern similar to a scuba dive. Pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable. Company Medical was called; but by this time it was 24 hours past the pressurization event. The flight attendant; who has a hearing impairment and wears hearing aids; reported being more plugged up than usual and was removed at Company Medical Doctor's request. The Flight Crew unaware pressurization to 3.0 psi was planned. Line Maintenance did not have copy of procedure with them. Flight Crew unaware of potential hazard due to no briefing from Maintenance personnel and no written copy of maintenance procedure. Ensure that when procedures are communicated from Maintenance Control to Line Maintenance; that warnings are transmitted. Provide written guidance on Flight Crew assisting Maintenance or provide adequate personnel to perform procedure without ANY assistance from Flight Crew.,Reporter stated the air conditioning packs on the EMB-145 are located in the wing root area under the cabin seats. The cabin pressure controller knob is extremely sensitive and controlling a rate of descent of 500 feet per minute is very difficult in the manual mode. The EICAS display indicated the cabin pressure had gone down to 1;500 feet during the ground pressurization leak check. What the actual pressure ended up being; he is not sure; but flying at altitude after that may not have been advisable as he learned later.,Crew was Deadheading in the cabin on an EMB-145 aircraft to ZZZ1 and heard a squeal sound when pilots added power. Upon landing captain informed Maintenance Control. Control contacted ZZZ1 contract mechanic to investigate a squeal sound in the aircraft cabin. Maintenance Control directed crew to start engines while contract mechanic and Maintenance Control investigated the squeal. Contract mechanic was on the phone with Maintenance Control. The mechanics believed the issue was a loose connection in the PACK systems. However; without the flight crew knowing; Maintenance Control directed contract mechanic to conduct an 'air check.'Crew was unaware of this procedure and not briefed prior. Contract mechanic did not have a checklist. Flight Attendant was onboard. Contract mechanic; under the direction of Maintenance Control; and without warning to the crew onboard; pressurized the cabin substantially below sea level using the manual mode pressurization system to achieve a 3.0 psi pressure differential. Crew and contract mechanic experienced uncomfortable ear pressures during the procedure and the procedure was stopped within 15 minutes. Contract mechanic tightened the PACK connections and under the direction of Maintenance Control the contract mechanic signed off his work. Crew did not report any medical conditions preventing the safe operation of the aircraft. Flight operated safely back to base; conducting flight back to ZZZ. This report is being submitted for the operation of two flights; ZZZ-ZZZ1-ZZZ; because the crew were on board an aircraft which was pressurized below sea level prior to these flights. The concern arises from the possibility that pressurizing the aircraft to a pressure below sea level may expose flight crews to injuries similar to those of scuba divers. Captain contacted Maintenance Controller X who stated that this procedure was not dangerous. Captain obtained the 'leak check' procedure from ZZZ Company Maintenance department and found the procedure was not what the crew witnessed. The crew did not have prior knowledge of the Medical Warning found on page one of the procedure. Captain contacted ZZZ Chief Pilot who did not know how to proceed but directed the captain to Company Medical. Captain called Company Medical whose Doctor concluded that further flights would be safe because 12-hours had elapsed from the exposure. However; Flight Attendant; who wears hearing aids was removed by Company Medical Doctor to evaluate ear conditions prior flying again.Crew was not briefed that Maintenance Control had directed contract mechanic to conduct a 'leak check.' Contract mechanic under the authority of Maintenance Control conducted the check without a visual checklist. This is not the first report captain has submitted highlighting the prevalence of Maintenance Control talking contract mechanics through a procedure via telephone. This practice is potentially dangerous especially if the WARNINGS in the procedures are not communicated to those persons inside an aircraft during these procedures. Company should issue written standards to the flight department outlining the approved procedures which would allow pilots and crew to assist contract mechanics with the servicing and maintaining of the aircraft fleet. These verbal procedures are potentially hazardous especially to flight crew because flight crew often operate in extreme environments and with limited time on the ground to acclimate or recover from exposures. Because the FAA relies largely on the science of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) for infection control procedures; then FAA should likely consult hyperbaric medical societies for procedures involving aircraft pressurization and the standards for medical screening of crew and passengers involved in these procedures and involved in inflight rapid depressurization events.,,A Contract Mechanic was directed by Maintenance Control to pressurize the cabin of an EMB-145 aircraft to below sea level in the manual mode. Flight crew and Flight Attendant were not made aware after being requested to start engines with the main cabin door closed. Uncomfortable ear pressure was experienced. Crew departed in the morning; but pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable due to scuba dive effect.,"The incident involved an EMB-145 aircraft operated by a flight crew from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and back. During the deadhead trip, the crew heard a squeal in the cabin and reported it to maintenance. Maintenance requested the crew to start engines with the cabin door closed and proceeded to manually pressurize the cabin to 3.0 psi without informing the crew. This resulted in uncomfortable ear pressure for the crew and the flight attendant, who has a hearing impairment, leading to her removal by a doctor. The root cause was the maintenance team's failure to brief the crew, lack of a checklist, and reliance on verbal procedures. The captain later discovered that the procedure followed wasn't the standard one, and this wasn't the first such incident, highlighting potential dangers of verbal communication in extreme environments. The proposed solutions include establishing written company procedures for maintenance and crew assistance, and consulting medical experts for safer pressurization standards. The outcome emphasized the need for clear communication and standardized procedures to prevent future incidents.",between attendant and crew

The logbook was signed and return to the flight deck. As we exit the acft the flight attendant called us back to the acft and mentioned to us that the ELT lanyard was unfolding. I removed the ELT from behind first class seats. I showed her that one of the water automatic release tape came unfastened. I mentioned to her to have the crew put it in the logbook when they arrived at the acft. I also mentioned to her that I am removing the ELT from the acft for repair and I will be returning with it prior to departure for re-installment to the acft. I went to the stock room at the hangar and to obtain another automatic release tape and res-secured the lanyard to the ELT. I immediately return to [the gate] to find out that the acft had already left without the ELT. I immediately notify my lead and he immediately notify the tower foreman. Tower foreman notify us that the acft was getting ready for takeoff and he was unable to have it return to the gate. Tower foreman mention to us that acft was scheduled to depart at XA:55. It left early at XA:44. Acft had already departed and the ELT was still in my possession. Flight attendant probably forgot to mention to the crew when they arrived to the acft. She probably became distracted while performing her cabin duties. Have the flight attendant put the discrepancy in her cabin logbook or remove the logbook from the acft. Upon returning to the acft; have the crew put it in the logbook,,,,A Mechanic removed a component from the aircraft to perform a repair. In the process; the Mechanic notified the Flight Attendant to advise the Flight Crew to write it up. When the Mechanic returned to the gate; the aircraft had departed without the component.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant and a Flight Crew member were involved in aircraft maintenance. The aircraft had logged maintenance issues that were addressed by the maintenance team, including the Flight Attendant. Upon leaving the aircraft, the Flight Attendant noticed an unfolding ELT lanyard. The Mechanist removed the ELT for repair and instructed the Flight Attendant to inform the crew to log the issue. However, the aircraft departed without the ELT, as the Mechanist returned to find it had left early. The cause was likely a communication breakdown, with the Flight Attendant failing to inform the crew, possibly due to being distracted. The result was a potential safety issue with the missing ELT. The proposed solution was for the Flight Attendant to note the discrepancy in the logbook or remove it.",between attendant and crew

We landed in ZZZ and deplaning took time. We had a full load of passengers and numerous wheelchairs.  Cockpit crew finished their day and left the aircraft.  Flight Attendants waited for the last passenger to deplane and walked out the Jetway with the Ground Agent. I asked the Agent which gate was Flight ABCC.  Agent responded 'Gate XX'.As I look to the right at Gate XX the agents are in the process of pulling tickets and boarding the aircraft.  The captain was behind the podium pulling his paperwork.  As I approached the gate I thought another flight may have still been on the gate. Then I read the signage at Gate XX; Flight ABCC. I asked the pilot if he was working the Flight ABCC.  He answered 'yes'. I told him we were his cabin crew.  Because of our late arrival time from ZZZ1 did they pull another crew to work to ZZZ3?  The captain gave me the crew list and we were still the original working crew. I asked 'Who is on the aircraft boarding the flight? I stated to the agent 'We are the working crew'. 'Who is on the aircraft boarding the flight'?Agent A looked at Agent B and asked 'Didn't you check the crew?  Who is on board the aircraft'?  Agent A sent Agent B down the Jetway to check if there was a crew on board.  Agent A then checked my ID and the rest of the working crew ID's and we proceeded down the Jetway. We passed Agent B in the Jetway and she confirmed there was 'no crew on board'.  This was a 757 aircraft; we were using the L2 door for boarding.I entered the aircraft there were between 10-15 passengers on board. Approximately six (6) passengers in First Class; the catering representative in the First Class galley wanting to check the galley packing; a non-working uniformed pilot was trying to stow his too-fat for the overhead suitcase in the closet; agent gave an unaccompanied child UNACH to Flight Attendant #4 to sign for and bring on board the aircraft; before the cabin crew had a chance to stow our luggage and check out safety equipment.,,,,A B757 flight attendant crew arrived late for their flight because of weather delays and found that the gate agents had begun boarding their flight without them having had the opportunity to do their pre-flight checks.

The ground personnel had started the process of boarding the aircraft, with approximately 10-15 passengers on board, including an unaccompanied child and crew members stowing personal luggage, despite the flight attendants not having completed their pre-flight safety checks. The flight attendants were initially mistaken for another crew due to a miscommunication. After verifying their identities and confirming that no other crew was on board, the original flight attendant crew proceeded to board the aircraft. The situation was resolved when the original crew assumed their duties, but the incident highlighted the importance of proper crew communication and pre-flight preparation to ensure passenger safety.",between attendant and crew

The gate agent informed me that there was no dispatch paperwork available and the aircraft was parked remotely off the gate; and that we would have to wait for it to be positioned at the gate by the ramp crew. At 30 mins prior; the plane was finally brought to the gate. Also; the dispatch paperwork was provided at approximately this same time. Upon reaching the aircraft; we found the aircraft was being fueled; and therefore we could not power up the aircraft until the fueling was complete per SOPs. I informed the gate of this minor delay in boarding and told them that we would board as soon as we could power up the aircraft to do our preflight. A few mins later; as fueling was completed I powered up the aircraft and we were beginning our preflight when a second gate agent walked onto the plane and demanded to know why we were not ready to board! I informed this new person of the late aircraft positioning by the ramp and of the fueling delay. As soon as we could board; we did; and all the passengers were on the plane 9-10 mins prior to departure; so we were in good shape to make an on time departure. The gate agent informed the Flight Attendant (FA) that all the passengers were on board so she began her physical passenger count. I continued my preflight duties and was looking through the paperwork when I looked out the window and realized the jet bridge had been pulled away from the aircraft. I then turned around to see the FA helping passengers and finishing her count in the middle of the aircraft. Because this aircraft had a plug door without stairs; I recognized what I believed to be a serious safety issue with the door open and no bridge attached. So I got out of the cockpit and pulled the Main Cabin Door into the closed position to keep anyone from inadvertently falling onto the ramp. I then called OPS and queried them about why the jet bridge had been pulled away from the aircraft without any communication with the flight crew. Their response was that they 'are understaffed' Moments later; a ramp agent came and slammed the handle down from outside the aircraft. I again got out of the cockpit and opened the door to have a discussion with this ramp agent to inform him of my safety concern of him slamming the door handle from the outside; and showed him the inside door handle that could have broke the FA's arm if she had had her hand on it at the same time.The main concern of the ramp agents and gate agents was to get the aircraft out on time; with little regard for the crew or the passengers' safety. About this time the FA asked me if the gate agent had given us a passenger count to confirm with her count. So I had to now contact OPS to ask for the passenger count to confirm with the FA's count because the gate agent pulled the jet bridge before confirming the count as we usually do.As I settled back into my cockpit duties to continue with my paperwork; I reviewed an MEL on the release that required the flight crew to physically check that the baggage door was secured from outside; so I immediately called OPS and requested the jet bridge be brought back to the aircraft to complete this task. This was 5 mins prior to departure; I was told to 'standby'. When OPS responded on the radio about a minute later; I was told that they would not reposition the bridge until I gave them a valid reason; and so I informed them of the MEL procedure that needed to be accomplished. It took another 3 mins for them to move the jet bridge back to the aircraft. When I got into the jet bridge; I was confronted by a male gate agent who appeared to be a Lead; but was not wearing a red coat. He proceeded to tell me that I was 'inconveniencing 46 passengers on the plane!' The ramp supervisor was there too; and I explained to him the MEL and my need to physically confirm the baggage door per the MEL. Heagreed and immediately accommodated me; walking with me down the jet bridge stairs and to the bag door. He was THE ONLY PERSON from the whole ground operation who was willing to help me keep the process moving! Unfortunately; by the time he personally had gotten involved; the safety issues had already been dealt with and we were now a late departure.The station operation team needs to understand that communication with the flight crew prior to removing a jet bridge from an airplane is vital to SAFETY. I don't think it is ever safe to have passengers on board an aircraft without stairs and an unmonitored door! I also think that in the interest of security; the gate agent needs to be in the jet bridge next to the airplane until the passenger count can be verified with the flight crew. Safety and Security ALWAYS needs to be placed above an on time departure! Also; if there is a safety or security concern raised with OPS; the ramp supervisor should immediately make himself available to the flight crew to attempt to resolve the situation.,,,,An EMB-145 Captain narrates a distressing breakdown in teamwork between ground personnel versus flight and cabin crews in a dispute over whether to work together to follow the rules--and regulations--for a safe and legal operation or to just get the jet out of the gate on time.,"The incident involved a conflict between ground personnel and the flight crew of an EMB-145 aircraft during pre-flight operations. The ground crew, aiming for on-time departure, removed the jet bridge prematurely while passengers were onboard and the door was open without stairs, posing a safety risk. The flight crew, led by the Captain, addressed this by closing the door, communicating with Operations (OPS), and emphasizing safety protocols. Despite OPS initially refusing to reposition the jet bridge, the ramp supervisor eventually assisted, though the departure was delayed. The Captain highlighted the need for improved communication and prioritization of safety over timeliness to prevent such issues.",between attendant and crew

During the course of the discussion we determined that the difference in sound was due to the much colder weather in Airport ZZZ. At that time; tower cleared us for takeoff; which we accepted. We accomplished the takeoff check; took the runway for departure; and climbed out uneventfully. After notifying the flight attendants that we were above 10;000 feet; one of them called to inform us that we had neglected to inform them that we were ready for takeoff; and one of them had to rush back to her seat to get seated on time. We apologized to the flight attendants; then the Captain and I reviewed the events leading up to takeoff and determined that we had forgotten to accomplish the Before Takeoff checklist; resulting in the failure to notify the flight attendants.Threats include the potential for missing an item on the checklist; which happened; and could have resulted in injury to the flight attendants.

The flight crew was distracted by unusual nose gear sounds during taxi-out, which they later attributed to cold weather conditions at the airport. Due to this distraction, the crew failed to complete the Before Takeoff checklist, resulting in them forgetting to inform the flight attendants of the readiness for takeoff. After climbing through 10,000 feet, the flight attendants notified the crew of the missed procedure, as one attendant had to rush back to her seat.

We were on an aircraft that does not nor has it ever had life vests under the seats for as long as it has been in the fleet. Because we were in sterile flight deck; I waited until we got above 10;000 feet; made my announcement; helped the B Flight Attendant set up her cart; then called the flight deck to notify them of the issue in the recording with the faulty information. My First Officer (FO) answered and I explained to him the issue with the recording saying we had life vests under the seats when we don't; and this aircraft is not supposed to. I told him that I had this aircraft a week or two ago and had already notified management of this issue; but figured since it obviously didn't get resolved yet that maybe it could get corrected while the plane was on overnight if they could write it up or if they knew of a form I could fill out. I was trying to be proactive about a safety issue. My first officer asked a few questions about it to get an understanding of how this aircraft was not supposed to have that recording and how this aircraft never had life vests under the seats to begin with.  I had some troubles hearing him as his microphone was not that loud/clear and it was very loud in the galley. We did end the conversation with an understanding of what the issue was to my knowledge. I hung up with him; at this point the B Flight Attendant had finished her meal service and was breaking down her cart when the phone rang with the flight deck calling. It was my Captain (CA) this time. At this point the plane had made either a slight descent or they slowed down (I could not tell) then the CA proceeded to tell me that the First Officer (FO) was freaking out saying that I told him that we were supposed to have life vests under the seats and we didn't. The CA then told me that they have been in communication with the company that we were going to divert making a code yellow emergency landing in 10 minutes because the FO was freaking out about us not having life vests. I asked the CA if he was serious; which he replied with 'yes' and then I asked him if we could avoid the diversion; that we did not need life vests and he said 'no.' I told the captain that I never told the FO we were supposed to have life vests; that I told him the opposite. The CA then told me that the FO said I did tell him we were missing life vests under the seats that we were supposed to have. I told him no I didn't; that I thought he understood me; but I could hardly understand him.  The CA then said to me 'oh so you're throwing my partner under the bus now?' I said 'no.' He then proceeded to tell me to stay calm about the code yellow emergency landing; let the B Flight Attendant know; he read off the current time to signify the start of the emergency landing; and to pack up all of stuff for landing. That we would be on the ground in 10 minutes and that I needed to call management right away; because they wanted to talk to me about this.  I said ok. The CA said he was going to make an announcement to the passengers at this time to let them know what was going on. My CA's voice during this conversation was stern and gave zero indication that this was anything but serious. I was freaked out; and started to brief my FA with what was going on.  Within a minute or two the flight deck called back while I was briefing her. It was my CA on the phone; and asked if it was me he was speaking with.  Then when I replied 'yes; it is' he started cracking up laughing and said he was kidding; that we were 37 minutes of from landing at destination.  At this point I was so freaked out about him telling me that we were having an emergency landing and that management wanted to talk to me I don't remember what I responded with. Probably something along the lines of 'not cool.' I told the B Flight Attendant thatI felt like I was about to pass out because I was so worked up. At this point CRM had been broken. After that we continued to put our stuff away and take care of our passengers. We could hear loud laughing and talking from the flight deck the rest of the flight. The pilots ended up blowing a procedure by being distracted by their joke and never gave a PA descent announcement to us or the passengers. We started to get pretty low; so I checked my cellphone app to see how far out we were. At this point we were less than 15 minutes out with no announcement or anything from the flight deck. I made the descent announcement to the passengers and within 2 minutes later the 10;000 foot chime went off. We landed and I did not communicate with my pilots. The only thing my CA said to me as I was packing up my bags was that I had a lot of bags and was high maintenance because of that; with a demeaning tone. The B Flight Attendant heard him say this; and told me 'wow; he's picking on you.' I did not reply as I was upset about them joking around about an emergency landing and management wanting to talk to me about it. CRM had already been broken.,,When I had finished my beverage service and was tearing down my cart when the other Flight Attendant (FA); started briefing me that we were going to divert and do an emergency landing. The flight deck then called interrupting her. After she got off the phone she told me they said they were just joking about the emergency landing. She then explained that it started when she had called the Flight deck to ask them to write up the [safety video]. The flight deck played a joke on her saying that because the [safety video] was inaccurate we must land immediately and that he was going to make an announcement to the passengers and she would need to contact management after we landed. Because of this there was a breakdown of CRM. The pilots behaved inappropriately by joking about an emergency landing.,,Regional jet flight attendants discover that the prerecorded passenger safety briefing incorrectly refers to life vests under the seats. The flight crew is notified of the discrepancy and they turn it into a prank stating they will have to make an emergency diversion. A few minutes later they call back to reveal the prank and that they are continuing to destination.,"The incident occurred on a regional jet during a flight when a Flight Attendant (FA) discovered that the prerecorded passenger safety briefing incorrectly stated that life vests were stored under the seats. The aircraft in question does not have life vests under the seats, as it has never been equipped with them. The FA reported this discrepancy to the flight deck after reaching 10,000 feet, informing the First Officer (FO) and subsequently the Captain (CA) about the issue. The FA also mentioned that she had previously reported this problem to management but had not received a resolution. During the communication, the FO misunderstood the FA's intent and believed she was indicating that the aircraft was missing life vests. This misunderstanding led the FO to inform the CA that an emergency landing was necessary. The CA, unaware of the confusion, prepared for a code yellow emergency landing, informing the passengers and directing the FA to contact management immediately. The FA vehemently denied having suggested that life vests were missing, emphasizing that she had pointed out the safety video's inaccuracy. The situation escalated when the CA called the FA again, revealing that the FO had misrepresented the situation. The CA admitted that the previous communication about the emergency landing was a joke, causing further confusion and distress for the FA. The FA felt targeted and upset, particularly when the CA laughed off the situation and corrected the timeline for landing, leaving the passengers and crew uninformed about the delay. The breakdown in Crew Resource Management (CRM) was further evident when the flight deck failed to provide a proper descent announcement, requiring the FA to inform the passengers herself. Upon landing, the CA made a demeaning comment about the FA's luggage, which was overheard by the other Flight Attendant. The incident resulted in a significant breakdown of CRM, impacting the professionalism and safety of the flight. The FA suggested addressing the faulty safety video as a solution to prevent similar issues in the future.",between attendant and crew

I could feel that we had started our descent.  I had begun normal landing duties (tidying up the galley and general duties).  I did hear the slats come down; however I just thought we were trying to slow down as little.  Next thing I hear is the gear come down.  I had been trying to look out and see how high we were; however I was unable to due to the visibility outside.  As soon as I heard the gear drop I called the flight deck and advised them that the cabin was NO WHERE near secure for landing; as no information was given to the flight attendants.  Also once I called the flight deck; then did the sterile light come on.  I advised them; we had kids standing up; bags out; people out of their seatbelts; and again that the cabin was not secure.  I was asked by the flight deck if we needed to go around; I stated 'YES'.  I was then asked; can you just sit down for landing.  I said UMMMMM yup and hung up the phone!  I made a PA; Flight attendant be seated for landing.  I secured the galley as fast as I could.  And sat in my jump seat; as did the B Flight Attendant.  No final descent announcement was given at all; as there was just not time.  We landed and taxied to the gate with no incident.  After landing; the Captain apologized to me many times.  He stated that they were extremely busy with weather and trying to figure out if we were going to divert to our [alternate].  At the very last minute; the weather improved and they shot the approach and forgot all about us in the back.Flight deck does get busy at times; however they cannot lose sight of what is going on in the back of the aircraft.

Whenever any passenger requested any sort of assistance from medical to a snack we were providing it to them. Flight attendants were making attempt to inform our base supervisor and crew services of the situations taking place on the aircraft. XA:30Pilot informed Lead Flight Attendant (LFA) of diversion to a nearby airport. The landing was going to take place rather fast. At this time LFA informed the other flight attendants of the diversion. Pilot In Command (PIC) made the PA announcement that the flight will be landing in ZZZ due to unable to land at our filed destination due to weather. LFA followed up with a PA announcement indicating the diversion. Also; stated for flight attendants to begin preparing the cabin for arrival. XA:454 chimes - Flight attendants picked up remaining service items and LFA did final compliance walk for landing. XB:02 (Actual)LFA made the arrival announcement.XB:05Aircraft was parked on Tarmac. LFA began Tarmac record. LFA pulled up Tarmac Delay information in [the Ipad]. Passengers begin standing in the aisle stretching legs and standing in line for the 3 lavatories on board. XB:25 [A] Passenger's wife came forward to the galley and stated husband is feeling very nauseous. FA 3 provided his wife with ginger ale; water; trash bag and offered a snack. At this time she refused a snack for him. Then [FA 3] followed passengers to seat to assess.XB:32LFA advised PIC we were in need of our official block out time for delay record. Instead of the block out time PIC informed lead we do not have this time since we are sitting on an active Tarmac. Instead noted and gave the arrival time into the divert airport. XB:42 PIC made announcement we were expecting to depart ZZZ and head to ZZZ1 in about an 1 hour and fifteen minutes. This would give the crew an ETA into our original destination of XC:57. With this ETA given lead then discussed with Flight Deck (FD) the potential for a pour service to be needed. Flight attendants were advised against a pour and snack service to be conducted. XC:00Passengers came forward and stated she was a diabetic and insulin was under the plane. She said she was due for it in about an hour. If we could give her some M&M's and water she would be fine until the delay is completed. Even though this was a medical related issue we did not have to ask for a doctor. Flight deck was notified by LFA. From XB:02 till XC:00 all doors on the aircraft were armed during the tarmac delay! XC:06 The flight deck made an announcement that the aircraft would be taxing to a different fueling area. LFA made prior to aircraft movement announcement minus electronic devices to ensure compliance before saying it was safe to move aircraft. LFA walked the cabin to ensure compliance. FA 2 and 4 were seated in jump seat with aft barrier strap up. FA 2 stated aft cabin secure. A single chime [to] flight deck to signal cabin was ready for movement. Flight deck then called and asked if we were ready for movement. LFA stated to captain 'this is why I single chimed you'.XC:20 Aircraft arrived at fueling area. Captain asked if doors were armed if so they needed to be disarmed because we were about to fuel. LFA made the announcement FA prepare doors for arrival.XC:23 [FA 3] who injured himself earlier on the deicing fluid in the cabin while stowing his baggage before departure FA 2 saw him limping. FA 2 called forward to ask if there was [a] bandage in the First aid kit. LFA looked at the items in our First Aid kit and we did not have [a] bandage. FA 2 came forward to get ice for the customer. XC:27[Another] passenger who had Claustrophobia came forward to the bulk head just looking for space away from other passengers and crew members. Crew members remembered this passenger from the previous week flight. Atthis point we noticed [passenger] very hot; sweaty and in a panic. She was saying can I just get air! She then began vomiting in the trash bag in the galley. LFA made the announcement of do we have any doctors or nurses on board and if so can you ring your FA call button. At this time LFA also notified the flight deck of the situation and we were filling out a cabin report. While the nurse who was chosen by [flight crew] as our medical personnel from mid cabin to come forward. LFA stayed with the passenger ensuring her everything was going to be ok and we were working with the FD for passengers to get off the aircraft.XC:29 PIC headed to aft of the aircraft to do a walk around. PIC asked flight attendants 2 and 4 to hold and watch the tail cone door exit. At this time he went down the steps the FA had deemed to be 'hazardous'.XC:31First Officer (FO) called [FA] into the FD after the cabin report had been given to them. With the cabin report [medical services] was contacted. Once [medical services] was contacted FO gave [FA] his personal cell phone to have the conversation with [medical services]. [Medical services] advised the passenger to begin doing breathing exercises. [Medical services] wanted the use of [oxygen]. [A FA] got the [oxygen] uncovered the mask and the customer felt like it would make her become more claustrophobic. On the cabin report the only medication the passenger stated she had taken was Gravol. At the time I did not know what Gravol was. Passenger said it was motion sickness medicine. When I was writing this report I researched what this drug is. According to [website] Gravol is a new synthetic drug. It is highly addictive and makes users dangerously paranoid; to the point of suicide. It also causes paranoia; kidney failure; hallucination. During the conversation with [medical services] I initiated a crew to crew call with [medical services]. During this short called I asked her to come forward and help with the passenger. [Medical services] at this time stated that the only medicine in our Medical kit which could be administered to the passengers was Benadryl. Passengers refused the Benadryl as well and stated the Gravol should work. Passenger asked if she could sit in a seat in the bulkhead. One of the passengers in [bulkhead seat] heard this comment be made and was willing to move to [passengers] seat. [passenger] thanked the guy in [bulkhead] for doing this for us. [Passenger] calmed down once this decision was made. XC:40 FA 4 stated beverage and snack service as requested was needed for the cabin. Lead had lost track of time during the medicals and everything else; which was taking place in the cabin. Lead notified FD pour service was beginning. XC:41 FA immediately began pour service. We used the plastic bins inside the carts lined them up with cups and started pouring water into them. During this pour service we ran out of water on the carts and crew water. The only water we had left was the water bottles the crew had already drank out of. This service was completed by the 120 minute mark of the delay. XD:19Lead notified Captain we were right at the 3 hour mark of the delay. Passengers even after the service began getting upset. LFA notified flight deck the passengers were beginning to get upset. During the Tarmac delay instead of using the Interphone system to communicate with lead. The flight deck was just opening the door to have communication. LFA ask flight deck if we can go to normal procedures to open the door due how the passengers were being. At this time LFA notified captain that we are getting close to that 3 hour mark of the delay. Asked captain to make another announcement. XD:21Captain advised lead we were about to taxi to gate. FA prepare doors for departure announcement was made. Aircraft was prepared for taxi to the gate. FA did compliance check.XD:27 Announcement was made to prepare doors for arrival. Captain notified FA that the aft stairs would be used for deplaning. FA 2 notified lead the aft stairs were not safe to deplane off of due to the slick liquid (De icing liquid) on the stairs. LFA notified Crew services we did not feel it was safe. They advised us that passengers should take all belongings because there was a chance the plane was going to get Remain Overnight (RON) for the night in the divert airport.XE:30 Captain advised to deplane from the aft stairs even though FA advised against it. As soon as this announcement was made passengers began deplaning prior to LFA finishing her conversation with her supervisor. Once off the phone LFA advised passengers to take all carry on luggage with them down the back stairs of the aircraft and use caution exiting. During the deplaning process [ill passenger's] bag was taken in. LFA asked FD if she could exit aircraft to retrieve her bag. They told LFA to have her contact our supervisor. During the time frame of XE:50 and XG:45[Ill passengers] exited the aircraft not long after the passengers did to deplane. When [medical services] got back onto the plane they stated the passengers are in the terminal area and no one is giving them any updates. They just wanted the pilots or some airline employee to give some updates! XG:45 Began boarding again up the tail cone stairs; which was contaminated with both snow and the deicing fluid. FD asked LFA if we were ok with doing this. After discussion with the crew we decided since they already deplaned off these stairs. It's not safe but [might] as well board and get to our filed destination! Now while boarding the water from snow melting in combination with the deicing fluid made more of the aisle way slick. Just like it was in the departure airport. The flight attendants tried to [mitigate] any risk while boarding and LFA made boarding announcements like normal. While boarding a gentleman near the front of the aircraft stated his name was not on the manifest the gate agent was using. LFA notified flight deck. LFA told the flight deck this could be seen as a security issue. PIC stated a gate agent must tell the flight deck no security issues prior to pushing back. After it appeared boarding was complete FA 2 completed a count when I read the verification announcement. FA's noted we were missing 8 people. This was verified by the gate agent giving FA 2 the names of the individuals to read on the PA. The FA 2 told passengers to ring their FA call buttons if they were on board. FA 4 and 3 re briefed exit rows. PIC handed the paper work through the window of the aircraft to a gate agent. LFA stated 'Cabin Secure!; Clear to Close?' I single chimed FD indicating we were ready for push back. FA 3 asked lead if she was ok with doing the safety demo and she would read the safety demo. I said yes and I did the safety demo in the cabin. After the safety demo I walked down the aisle to ensure compliance again. Once I got back informed passengers we would be dimming the cabin lights for departure and read the deicing announcement. XH:15Finally; we landed in our originally filed destination. Arrival announcement was made and we apologized for the delay. Also; stated use caution when exiting the aircraft and getting carry on luggage out of the over head bins. LFA made the FA prepare doors for arrival announcement was made. LFA did her cabin sweep of any left items and cross checked all doors were not armed.XH:58 Crew called crew services to find out information about ride to hotel; what hotel we are staying in and what our show time is for the next day. Finally got the [hotel] our crew was dead tired. We all just wanted to check in and put our heads on a pillow. The day had used every ounce of energy we had. Once I walked up stairs to my room the hall way smelled as if smoking had been taking place. It didn't smell like cigarettes to me. Being in aviation I wasn't ok with the smell I was smelling just in case I was to get drug tested.

I told her that it was 11 minutes until scheduled departure. I had also informed the gate agents twice during boarding that oversized carry on baggage was entering the aircraft. The agent Supervisor stated that the cargo [bin] had already closed. I told her that we may still have bags to check due to [being] oversized. At that time a bag came to the [forward] galley that was obviously well larger than the bag sizer would allow. The agent Supervisor repeated that the cargo [bin] was closed.

As soon as I left the immediate area; the agent Supervisor told [another Flight Attendant] that they had to go and proceeded to close the entry door. The FAR for overhead bin was violated. The FAR for stacked luggage in the closet was violated since additional oversized bags were on the plane and the only option was to stack them in the forward closet.

Aircraft resumed taxiing; making lots of turns and stops. The arrival announcements had been done; passengers were complying; by staying seated and bags stowed. The aircraft came to a stop; several bells went off and the seat belt sign was turned off. I made the 'disarm door' announcement; turned the cabin lights to bright and disarmed the 1R. When I was ready to disarm 1L I looked out the door window; I did not see ANYTHING!!! I heard the engine running but that is not unusual. I looked again to see if I had made a mistake and the seat belt sign was actually still on-- NO it wasn't; so I called the flight deck. I asked Captain if we were at the gate. He replied NO and I told him we had gotten several bells and the seat belt sign was off. He turned on the sign; I re-armed my 1R; made an announcement that there was a malfunction with our bell system; we needed everyone to take their seats; [and] we were resuming the taxi. Most of the bags were down already. We closed the overheads. There was no way; or time; to put the bags back; as we were moving again. I felt the passengers being seated were more important; at this moment. We did not have an option to stow bags. It was not a safe situation; if an evacuation had been warranted we would have had a lot of bags going down slides (they wouldn't have had to waste time to get them; they already had them-- a little sarcasm- given the number of bags that came off). Once we did reach our gate; the sign went off again and I made the door disarm announcement. Needless to say; they deplaned quickly because they had all their items ready. Captain was very apologetic; He said there was an aircraft taxiing towards us at one point; he reached up to turn off the nose gear light; and inadvertently hit the 'seat belt sign' switch. When I explained; to him; what had happened in the cabin; he said we did what we could have; given the circumstances. He wouldn't have been able to stop long enough for us to get everything stowed. I can tell you; we held our breath until we were safely at the gate. I might have seen that we were a long way from the terminal if I had looked out the 1R door before disarming it; but that is NOT part of the procedure at that door. When I did look out 1L; which was when I noticed that there were NO lights; and NO terminal. I relied solely on the bells and seat belt sign being turned off. The viewing ports/windows on the Airbus doors - do NOT look out; unless you are bent over looking outside- instead; from a seated position; you see the ground- NOT the surrounding area.,,,,After landing and a lengthy taxi the aircraft is stopped and the seat belt sign is turned off. The Lead Flight Attendant makes the arrival announcement and disarms door 1R before turning to door 1L and discovering the aircraft is not at the gate and the passengers are all standing with their luggage in the aisle. The Captain had inadvertently turned off the seatbelt sign while attempting to turn off the taxi light.,"The incident occurred after the aircraft landed and was taxiing to the gate. The seatbelt sign was inadvertently turned off by the Captain while attempting to adjust the taxi light. This led the cabin crew to believe the aircraft had arrived at the gate. The Lead Flight Attendant instructed passengers to return to their seats and continue moving, as stowing luggage wasn't feasible. Upon reaching the gate, the correct signal was given, allowing a quick deplaning. The crew's prompt action ensured passenger safety despite the initial confusion.",between attendant and crew

I called the Aft Flight Attendant in the aft galley and asked her if her crew oxygen compartment was sealed as well (it was). I brought the issue to the attention of the Captain and told him about my concerns and that I did not believe the seals should be there. After a brief discussion; he said he would make a call and let me know. A few minutes later; the Captain told me that he spoke to Dispatch and they told him to tell me to look in my [Flight Attendant] Manual; that a list of approved locations for security seals would be in there. I told him I didn't think such a list was in the Flight Attendant Binder and asked him if Dispatch mentioned where in my binder it might be. He just repeated his prior statement of 'look in your Manual'.I did as instructed; but after several minutes of searching was unable to locate the list that the Captain had mentioned. It was clear that I was not going to get an answer from the Captain on this issue and that I was 'chasing my own tail' looking in the Manual (for something that's not in there) so I called the (city) Inflight Office and spoke with a Supervisor. I explained the situation; however he did not know the answer; but said that he would call Maintenance and call me back ASAP. I told the Captain that I was unable to locate the list in my Manual and I had called Inflight and told him what the Supervisor was doing. The Captain then proceeded to 'chew me out' saying that any call to Maintenance had to go through him first and that I should not have done it the way I did it. I explained to him that I had in fact brought the issue to his attention first and that he essentially blew me off by telling me to find the answer myself. He kept telling me in an accusatory tone that I should not have called Maintenance without speaking to him first; I repeatedly told him that I did not call them; I only called my Supervisor for an answer because I wasn't getting one from him. The conversation was going nowhere; he was just accusing me; and I felt the need to defend myself; so I just stated one last time '(city) Inflight is calling Maintenance' and left the flight deck. A short time later; the Inflight Supervisor called me back and told me that after speaking with Maintenance he determined that the crew oxygen compartments should NOT be sealed. With the Supervisor on the phone; I relayed that information to the Captain. The Captain then asked to speak with my Supervisor; so I handed him the phone. They spoke briefly; and then he hung up. The Captain then told me that the seals should not be there. I asked him; 'Is Maintenance going to come out and remove them; or should I remove them?' He told me to remove the seals; so I did and brought the seals back to him. He then told me that the 'list' he was referring to was not in my Flight Attendant Manual; and again chastised me for 'not consulting him before calling Maintenance'. At that point; I just wanted to be done with the situation; I was tired of his accusations; so I just said 'ok' and left. Several minutes after we closed the [main] entry door; the Captain called back and told me to re-open the forward entry door. Maintenance came onboard to write something in the logbook. As a result of this situation the flight was delayed by 16-minutes. Maintenance needs to pay very close attention to where they are putting those security seals; they must follow all procedures; and also use some common sense and good judgment when performing tasks. If anyone should have a clear understanding of why those compartments should not be sealed shut; it would be a mechanic. Also pilots in general; and this pilot specifically; need to trust and listen to the concerns of their flight attendants. Crewmember's safety related concerns should NEVER be blown off like mine were; no matter how busy you might be.,Reporter stated that when he came onboard a large transport aircraft; the forward and aft flight attendant jumpseat overhead oxygen masks compartments were taped over with company security seals. As far as he knows; the aircraft had flown all day with the O2 mask compartments sealed up. But taping over and restricting automatic deployment of flight attendant oxygen mask compartments at the forward and aft jumpseat locations would result in all three flight attendants not having oxygen available to them; especially during a sudden cabin depressurization. He did not believe there would be enough time for any of the flight attendants to get to a Personal Oxygen Bottle (POB).Not only was there a serious potential for all three flight attendants to become incapacitated; but assisting with any passenger emergency or implementing cabin procedures could also be impacted.,,,A Flight Attendant reports having conflict with a Captain over the cabin crew oxygen mask compartments at the forward and aft flight attendant jumpseat positions on their large transport aircraft having been taped over with security seals.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the captain regarding the presence of security seals on the cabin crew oxygen mask compartments above the forward and aft jumpseats. The flight attendant noticed the compartments were sealed and raised concerns with the captain, who initially instructed her to consult the Flight Attendant Manual for a list of approved locations for the seals. After failing to locate the list, the flight attendant contacted the inflight office supervisor, who then reached out to maintenance. The captain became upset, accusing the flight attendant of contacting maintenance without consulting him first. Despite the flight attendant's clarification that she had sought resolution through proper channels, the captain reprimanded her. Following further communication, maintenance confirmed that the compartments should not be sealed, and the flight attendant removed the seals. The captain reiterated his disapproval, and the flight experienced a 16-minute delay. The incident highlighted the need for maintenance to adhere to proper procedures and for the captain to consider flight attendants' safety concerns more carefully.",between attendant and crew

Called Maintenance as the IFE Contractor had put an entry in the logbook as accomplished work card 23-32-00 (ops check system normal). RJAA Maintenance arrived at the gate and I asked him if he could remove the system placard. He called the IFE Technician to the plane who then told me that the system worked but needed further troubleshooting. Logbook items 12; 13; 14 & 16 all addressed parts of the IFE system. Local Maintenance did not clear the IFE placard. Per the MEL 23-10 and NEF 23-33b; I instructed the Purser not to use the IFE system for any of the required passenger safety briefings; or other pre-recorded announcements. After departure; I was made aware that the IFE system was used for the passenger safety demo. Apparently; the Purser decided to use the system after being instructed by me (Captain) not to use this equipment.  AFTER GATE ARRIVAL THE PURSER CAME TO COCKPIT; I DISCUSSED WITH HER THE VIOLATION OF POLICY AND POSSIBLE FAR'S REGARDING USE OF AN AIRCRAFT SYSTEM THAT WAS ON MEL PLACARD; AND THAT THE FINAL AUTHORITY FOR OPERATION OF COMPANY EQUIPMENT RESTS WITH THE CAPTAIN DESIGNATED ON THE FLIGHT RELEASE.  SHE TOLD ME THAT THE MECHANICS; AS THEY LEFT THE AIRCRAFT IN TOKYO; TOLD HER THE SYSTEM WAS FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND TO USE IT.  I POINTED OUT THAT THE CAPTAIN HAS THE LAST SAY REGARDING USE OF EQUIPMENT ON COMPANY AIRCRAFT AND THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE COORDINATED WHAT SHE BELIEVED PROPER USE WITH THE CAPTAIN AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY TOLD HER SPECIFICALLY NOT TO USE THE PRE-RECORDED PORTION OF THE IFE SYSTEM AS IT WAS PLACARDED INOP.,,Captain reviewed the logbook items and spoke to both the Narita Mechanic and two tech reps about the issue. [Captain] then declared that the IFE system would not be used by crew. In the course of the flight; it was discovered that the cabin crew made an attempt to utilize the IFE system which proved unsuccessful. Considering the consequences of an MD-11 accident and other experiences with IFE malfunctions and fires; adherence to Captain's directive needs to trump cabin crew intuition. Additionally; MEL/CDL/NEF guidance concerning placarding is vague and needs to be reduced to plain language with the mutual consent of the company and the FAA. This is the second time I've witnessed a problem involving crews and Maintenance personnel not understanding placarding procedures. This entire situation might've been averted if placarding guidance had clearly stated that an INOP sticker needed to be placed on the ON/OFF switch at the IFE control console.Remind cabin crew of Captain's authority. Simplify guidance for installing INOP stickers for MEL/CDU/NEF items; particularly those in the cabin.,,B777 Captain is informed after the fact that the Purser attempted to use the IFE system for passenger briefing after being advised that it was inoperative on MEL and not to be used.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and the flight attendant regarding the use of an inoperative In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) system on a B777 aircraft. The IFE system was placarded as inoperative (MEL 23-10) and the captain had instructed the purser not to use it for passenger safety briefings or other pre-recorded announcements. Despite this directive, the purser attempted to use the system during the safety briefing, believing it was functional based on communication with maintenance personnel. After the flight, the captain addressed the issue with the purser, emphasizing the captain's authority as the final decision-maker regarding the use of company equipment. The purser argued that maintenance had indicated the system was functional. The captain stressed the importance of adhering to MEL directives and the potential risks associated with using unapproved systems, referencing past incidents involving IFE malfunctions. The incident highlighted a gap in understanding of placarding procedures, with the captain proposing that guidance on MEL/CDL/NEF placarding should be simplified and standardized, particularly for systems in the cabin. Additionally, the captain recommended ensuring cabin crew awareness of the captain's authority and the importance of coordinating with the flight deck before using systems that are placarded inoperative. The B777 captain discovered that the purser had attempted to use the inoperative IFE system for passenger safety briefings despite being explicitly instructed not to do so. The purser believed the system was functional based on communication with maintenance. The captain emphasized the importance of adhering to MEL directives and clarified their authority as the final decision-maker.

I was working in Economy. We had just finished setting up the beverage cart to start our service. The turbulence then became moderate. Coffee was coming out of the pots; water bottles were rocking back and forth as were we; in the back of the aircraft. The other Aft Flight Attendant called the flight deck and spoke to the Captain and asked him to turn on the seatbelt sign; as we were unstable in the rear of the aircraft. The Captain said 'no' and refused to turn on the seatbelt sign. Both aft flight attendants were shocked at his response. She hung up the phone; not knowing what to say at this point. It was at this time a passenger was exiting the most rear lavatory. She had to hang on to the assist handle as she could not make it back to her seat. I then called the Captain; introduced myself and said; 'Captain this is the back. I don't think you are aware of how bumpy it is back here. Could you please turn on the seatbelt sign?' He then answered; 'I am in control of the seatbelt sign and I am not turning it on.' I then said; 'Are you kidding?' I thought he was being sarcastic and could not believe that he was questioning our judgment. Both aft flight attendants could not understand or believe his response. We then notified the Purser of what had taken place. I then talked with a deadheading pilot who was seated in the last seat position 'F.' I asked him if I was being unreasonable and how best to communicate with this pilot. He was also shocked at this pilot's response to our request. We considered our own safety needs and did not start the service until we felt comfortable. During the service; while it was perfectly smooth; the Captain came on the PA and asked the flight attendants to be seated. Both aft flight attendants looked at each other as we could not believe what he was asking. When we got to the rear galley; we stowed the carts and sat in our jumpseats. We called the Purser to find out what was going on. The Captain had not communicated anything to her prior and it was only after she called him; he mentioned there might be turbulence up ahead. We sat for approximately 15 minutes with NO turbulence. Both aft flight attendants felt that this pilot was not concerned with our well being and/or safety; or the passengers. This is a safety issue and our respect for this Captain was lost when he gave the response he did. We also then did not trust him or his judgment throughout the flight and was actually contemplating that he was purposely being erratic and irresponsible. His behavior conveyed a complete lack of concern for our safety and our passenger's safety. I would feel extremely uncomfortable ever flying with this Captain again.,,,,A A320 Aft Flight Attendant asked the Captain during turbulance to turn the seat belt sign ON; but he refused. When asked a second time by the Lead Flight Attendant he responded 'I am in control and not turning it on.' The crew was in disbelief and distrusting.,"The incident occurred during a flight involving an A320 aircraft. Approximately 15-20 minutes after takeoff, moderate turbulence was experienced in the rear of the aircraft. The Aft Flight Attendant requested the Captain to turn on the seatbelt sign due to the instability, but the Captain refused, stating, ""I am in control of the seatbelt sign and I am not turning it on."" The flight attendant, along with the other Aft Flight Attendant, expressed disbelief and concern over the Captain's response, feeling it disregarded their safety and that of the passengers. The flight attendants deferred to a deadheading pilot for guidance, who also expressed shock at the Captain's refusal. Fearing for their safety, the flight attendants delayed service until conditions stabilized. Later, the Captain instructed the flight attendants to sit down via the public address system, despite the absence of turbulence at the time. The flight attendants felt the Captain's actions demonstrated a lack of concern for their safety and the passengers', leading to a loss of respect and trust in his judgment. The flight attendants considered the behavior a serious safety issue and stated they would feel uncomfortable flying with the Captain again.

Discussed the light with the Captain and because of the likelihood of a long delay in ZZZ; we elected to come to ZZZ1 and report the light 'On'. In ZZZ1; Maintenance found enough debris that the aircraft was removed from service to flush the oil system and recheck for debris. [Contributors]:1) There is no guidance for the flight crew regarding the chip detector. It is not part of the normal preflight inspection but the light is obvious if 'On'. Without guidance there is confusion as to whether this is something we should check or even be concerned about if it is 'On'. 2) The most common time to find this light 'On'; is during the first flight of the day preflight which is usually at an outstation. Due to the difficulty of getting Maintenance to the Outstation and the likelihood of a lengthy delay; it is difficult to convince myself; much less the Captain; that we should report the problem at the Outstation. This is the second time in the last two months I have delayed reporting the light 'On' to avoid delay at the Outstation.

After discussing the issue with the Captain, they decided to divert to ZZZ1 due to concerns about potential delays at the outstation. Upon arrival, Maintenance discovered sufficient debris in the chip detector, leading to the aircraft being removed from service for oil system flushing and reinspection. Contributors to the incident included the lack of clear guidelines for flight crew regarding the chip detector light, which is not part of the standard preflight inspection. The First Officer noted that the light frequently illuminated during the first flight of the day at outstations, and the difficulty of obtaining timely Maintenance support at remote locations compounded the decision to delay reporting. This was the second occurrence in two months, with the first five instances requiring only a simple cleaning of the detector. To prevent future occurrences, the First Officer recommended the establishment of clear guidelines for flight crew actions when the chip detector light is illuminated, aiming to address confusion and reduce the risk of similar incidents.",between attendant and crew

After the [onboard] services; the crews have been putting aluminum cans in the New Tech electrical [food] carts. When I made this known to the [more experienced] flight attendant crews; the response was negative and I quote that their response is 'This is what we have always done.' I am considered a Junior Flight Attendant. The carts have shown malfunction from the collaboration of the aluminum and electrical appliances. If abused it can cause other malfunctions to the electrical system(s) of the aircraft. ALL New Tech Carts hold HEAT!!!! When aluminum is introduced to the hot electrical plates it can cause an explosion. I was told that they do it because they are not going to plug the carts back up to the electrical [cord.] But what happens when the next crew uses the carts? The [residue] cannot be washed away. I believe that is what they think; or burned away using the integrity of the airplanes electrical heating systems. AGAIN; this has been practiced numerous times. My response is I am not stupid to the following working crew. And they wonder why we have mechanical problems with the planes. The [aluminum] can explode if they continue to practice this method [or] attitude.,Reporter stated the New Tech Carts can chill or heat food. Switches for the cooling or heating of carts are located at the Galley's upper panel. Only the Aft Galley on their B747's currently use the New Tech Carts. An electrical cord from each cart is connected to another cord supplying electrical power for heat or cold. Older carts were either chiller or hot carts; not both.Reporter stated her concern was the potential for the used aluminum cans to melt on the heating pads and releasing mercury or some other fumes. Heating pads are believed to be made of a ceramic/metal material. Another concern was the lack of training for many of the flight attendants who just don't understand how the New Tech Cart's function. Many times she has found flight attendants trying to heat food while they also had the chiller switch 'On' and complaining the heater was not working. Reporter noted she has nineteen years flying experience.,,,A Flight Attendant describes the potential for electrical malfunctions caused by stowage of empty aluminum cans in the New Tech Cart food trays and the lack of training for the proper operation of the carts on B747-400 aircraft.,"The incident involved a conflict between two flight attendants regarding the improper storage of empty aluminum cans in the New Tech electrical carts used for heating and cooking meals on a B747-400 aircraft. The junior flight attendant reported that storing aluminum cans in the carts could lead to electrical malfunctions, explosions, or residue buildup that might harm future operations. Despite their concerns, the more experienced flight attendants dismissed the issue, stating it was a longstanding practice.

When I answered I received a very loud and frantic voice repeating this 'XXXX; XXXX; we must land immediately.' I tried to gain more information to no avail. I declared an emergency and asked for a return to the airport. When asked what the nature of the emergency was; I stated that is was unclear; however; it could be a fire type of situation. During the 180 degree turn back we received a second chime and got the same verbiage from the flight attendants. 'XXXX; XXXX; we must land immediately.' Soon thereafter I took the control of the airplane and radios and asked the First Officer to get more information from the back. We eventually found out that is was an ill passenger who was having a heart attack and CPR was being administered. I then stated to ATC what type of emergency we had and entered a downwind for the landing runway.The phrase 'XXXX' is mentioned one time in our operations manual. It is a Flight Attendant to Flight Attendant reference only. Simple English; with details; need to be used when describing a situation in the cabin of the airplane. Due to the severity of the ill passenger (heart attack; no pulse; no breathing and CPR being done) the flight attendants were under a lot of stress. They performed very well and I would like to acknowledge they probably saved this mans life! GREAT JOB! However; I feel there needs to be much more awareness of the fact that we are not privy to or trained in some of their references; acronyms etc. My perception of what was maybe a fire or other [question of airworthiness] type of situation; even though for a very short time; is very concerning due to the [lack of specificity] from the flight attendants.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger had a heart attack shortly after takeoff; an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.

While walking down the jet bridge the inbound crew informed the four of us flight attendants that we have a mechanical.  They discovered a missing portion of the Emergency Lighting strip on the floor by Row-12 and wrote it up.  They said that it is a 'No-Go' item.  When I boarded the B757-200 airplane; I immediately went to Row-12 to see the missing lighting strip.  It was plain to see that the strip was missing.  My three flying partners all saw it as well and noted it's nothing we have ever seen before. Soon a Maintenance employee was on board examining the area.  I walked up to him and started a discussion about the missing strip. He began to explain to me how the lighting strip is NOT missing; that merely the portion of carpet in that area is what's missing.  I was quite surprised by his explanation and assertively shared my complete disagreement for his assessment.  How; if the pilots were to turn on the emergency lighting that the missing portion would not light up at all; and that is not normal.  To further prove my point I told him I was going to ask the pilots to turn on the lighting so he could see for himself.  I then walked up to the cockpit and asked the Captain if they could turn on the emergency lights so he could walk back with me and also tell the Mechanic that the missing portion does in fact exist and that it is not normal.  Captain then instructed the First Officer to turn on the lighting so he could walk back with me to see the missing lighting strip. When the emergency lights were on; the lighting strip went from a lit strip to dark carpet by Row-12 then to a lit strip again.  I motioned to both the Mechanic and Captain how that is not 'normal' and it's a safety issue.  The Mechanic dismissed my comment as he continued with his explanation to the Captain how the plane is DESIGNED this way.  I was astounded.  I assertively stated that the incoming crew knew this wasn't normal; which is why they wrote it up.  I and my three flying partners have never seen a missing lighting strip before and knew it wasn't normal; and now I'm to believe that Boeing designed their 757s with a missing lighting strip by Row 12?!  The Captain said if the Mechanic is okay with it; then he is too.  I took a picture of the missing portion by Row-12 (and happened to get the Captains feet in the picture.)  The Mechanic left the plane and came back about ten minutes later.  When he returned he told me that he went to a nearby gate where another B757 [aircraft] was parked and examined Row-12 on that plane and how that plane also had the same missing strip by Row-12.  He showed pictures of that planes missing strip as well.  I responded by telling the Mechanic that simply because another plane has a missing strip that doesn't necessarily mean it's normal and doesn't need to be addressed and/or fixed.  How again the inbound crew knew to report it; how the current crew knows it's not normal and how I'm not okay with it missing due to it being a safety issue. Although I don't have Captain's authority to make a final decision about it; yet I made it known my own level of discomfort with it as it's an obvious potential safety issue.  If we had to evacuate upon landing in ZZZ1; that area [of the cabin floor] would not have lit up; especially since we landed late at night. To further my correct stance on this issue; we worked on another B757 the following day out of ZZZ1.  The four of us flight attendants were quick to notice a fully intact lighting strip by Row-12 on this plane.  We also happened to have the same cockpit crew Captain and First Officer.  I told the Captain that this plane does have the lighting strip by Row-12; how the plane is not designed to have a missing portion of the strip and that it should have been fixed on our plane yesterday.  I did not receive a receptive response.I cannot help but feel that our safety was not a priority on this flight.  Either the Mechanic didn't want to fix the missing strip or he somehow knew that they didn't have a replacement to fix the strip which would have caused a significant delay or potential cancellation of my flight.  Regardless; no excuse should be given for allowing this plane to fly the manner in which it did. I felt as though my opinion didn't matter; didn't count and wasn't professionally regarded with the priority it should have been given.  If safety is our Air Carrier's number one corporate value; they fell very short with me and my crew and all the passengers on this flight. Worked First Class [section].,,,,A Flight Attendant working as a Purser; describes her efforts to address cabin egress safety issues after being informed that a section of the cabin floor Emergency Lighting strip was missing on their outbound B757 aircraft.,"The incident involved a Purser on a flight from ZZZ-ZZZ1 who was informed by the inbound crew about a missing portion of the Emergency Lighting strip in Row-12, classified as a 'No-Go' item. Upon boarding, she confirmed the missing strip, which her crew also deemed unusual. She discussed the issue with a maintenance employee, who claimed the carpet was missing instead of the lighting strip. The Purser demonstrated the safety risk by having the pilots activate the emergency lights, revealing a dark area where the strip was missing. Despite her evidence, the mechanic and captain dismissed her concerns, with the captain deferring to the mechanic. The Purser took a photo and later found another B757 with the same issue. She argued that the problem warranted attention but felt her concerns were disregarded. The next day, on a different B757 with an intact strip, she again highlighted the inconsistency, but her feedback was not addressed. She expressed dissatisfaction with the handling of the issue, feeling her safety concerns were overlooked, and questioned the prioritization of safety.",between attendant and crew

I explained that although the company and its pilots have been using this as standard practice to give customers more time to use the onboard WiFi that it was in violation of both company (manual) policy as well as a violation of two FARs. I thought that we had the situation under control until we hit the bumps and the Captain told us that he was sitting us down but the customers could continue to use all electronic devices. We only have a secure cabin or an unsecure cabin. Our flight landed unsecure. The customers had tray tables back down and all electronics on. Had an evacuation happened; customers would have wasted great amounts of time trying to get around all the laptops and other electronic devices.,,,,A flight attendant reported that the company and its pilots are colluding to seat flight attendants early when turbulence is expected on landing but allow passengers to continue using onboard WiFi until descending through 10;000 MSL. Flight attendants thus are precluded from making their pre-landing checks of passenger compliance with safety regulations. The reporter believes the result is aircraft landing unsecured as passengers continue to utilize electronic devices and leave tray tables down; contrary to regulations.,"The incident involved a disagreement between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding safety protocols during expected turbulence. The flight attendant raised concerns that the practice of seating flight attendants early during pre-flight, while allowing passengers to continue using onboard WiFi until descending through 10,000 feet, violated company policy and Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs). The flight attendant argued that this practice prevented them from conducting necessary pre-landing safety checks, potentially leaving the cabin unsecured upon landing. The flight attendant noted that passengers' tray tables remained down and electronic devices were in use, which could obstruct an evacuation in the event of an emergency. The flight landed unsecured, and the attendant emphasized that this practice posed a significant safety risk.

Also; while talking with the crew; they stated that ZZZ had lots of rain the night before; and lots of condensation that morning in the aircraft. I believe that any water that came from the overhead area of the aircraft was the result of condensation in the aircraft Air Ventilation System.    Due to the discussions we had that day; I believed that the statement about water coming from the overhead areas was more of information into the discrepancy that needed to be investigated and not a discrepancy itself that needed to be addressed; in the action taken block in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook (AML).  Don't assume any information in the [Logbook] Discrepancy block doesn't need to be addressed in the [Logbook's] Action Taken block.,,,,A Line Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT) explains why he did not state in a Logbook sign-off that he had also checked the cabin overhead panels; floors and the E/E compartment for evidence of water intrusion after he had Removed and Replaced (R/R) a Battery Charger.

Continued the QRH and landed with the Left engine at idle.  We did Declare an Emergency.  Because of where the event began; passing 21;000 FT; we were very busy running checklists and preparing for the approach.  We finally completed all checklists and the approach briefing at approximately 4;000 feet on a five mile base for the runway.During the post flight discussion with the crew; the Flight Attendant noted that we had failed to provide the signal for descent through 10;000 FT.  It seems that we omitted this step due to task saturation.  This is an easy miss as the cabin advisory is no longer a checklist item.  This 10;000 FT signal seems to be omitted fairly regularly and is especially likely to be omitted during an abnormal event.  This problem could be alleviated if we reinstated the cabin notification in the Descent and Approach Checklist.,,,,Preoccupied with abnormal procedures generated by a bleed air duct temperature warning; the Flight Crew of a CRJ-200 failed to broadcast the alert to the Flight Attendants as they passed through 10;000 FT MSL as required by their company SOP.,"The incident involved a CRJ-200 flight crew and a flight attendant. During the flight, the crew encountered a 14th stage Bleed Air Duct warning, which led them to follow the QRH procedures, including selecting wings and cowls off and closing the left 14th stage bleed air. They declared an emergency and landed safely with the left engine at idle. Due to their focus on abnormal procedures and checklist management, the crew failed to provide the required cabin signal for descent through 10,000 FT as per the company's Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The flight attendant noted this omission during a post-flight discussion. The missed signal was attributed to task saturation, as the cabin advisory is no longer a checklist item and is often omitted, especially during abnormal events.

Nothing was ever said to me about Air Marshals on the flight. This flight had FAA Inspector on board; who works in the Certificate Management Office. The problem began when the agent started the boarding process without consulting with the flight attendants. Passengers arrived at the airplane; catching the flight attendants off guard. The FAA Inspector actually held the passengers on the jet bridge while the flight attendants scrambled to prepare the airplane. FAA Inspector apparently confronted the ticket agent and; according to the Inspector; the ticket agent copped an attitude. A few minutes later an armed FBI agent appeared at the cockpit door to show me his ID. I had no paper work on the individual and he said the ticket agent had my copy of the paper work. A few minutes later a DEA agent arrived at the airplane; and this time the ticket agent had sent my paper work with the DEA agent. I asked the DEA agent if he was aware of the Air Marshals and the FBI agent that were also on the flight; and he said he knew about the FBI agent; but not the Air Marshals. I immediately called for a supervisor to come to the plane. I explained the situation to the supervisor and he apologized for the mix up and said he would take care of the issue. A few minutes later another ticket agent came into the cockpit and I asked if the LEOs had met the Air Marshals. He said there were no Air Marshals on board. Then the original ticket agent came to the cockpit and I asked him if there were any Air Marshals on board. He said 'no'. One of the ticket agents went back to the gate counter and returned to the airplane a few minutes later and told me there were indeed two Air Marshals on board. Knowing that the two LEO's did not know of the Air Marshals; I instructed the ticket agent to inform all four armed individuals of each other. (Which he did). The flight departed 13 minutes late with no further issues. FAA Inspector said he would be investigating the events on this flight which has prompted me to submit this report.,,,,Armed Federal Agents and Law Enforcement Officers boarded aircraft without proper notification to the crew and or knowledge of each others presence.,"An incident occurred when multiple armed federal agents boarded a flight without prior notification to the crew, resulting in confusion and a delayed departure. The agents included an FAA Inspector, FBI agent, DEA agent, and two Air Marshals. The boarding process began without consulting the flight attendants, who were unprepared, causing a delay as passengers were held on the jet bridge. Communication issues led to the flight attendant being unaware of all law enforcement personnel initially. After an FBI agent and DEA agent arrived, the flight attendant sought a supervisor, who apologized and resolved the confusion by informing all agents of each other's presence.

He said that this would be a normal landing and I rephrased it as a question 'we should prepare the cabin for a normal landing?' and his answer was; 'Yes.' The call ended shortly after. The airplane began to descend shortly after an announcement to the passengers from the pilots. The landing gear was extended much earlier than usual before landing. Upon landing a number of fire personnel met the aircraft off the runway. Although emergency fire personnel were in the jet bridge; the passengers deplaned normally. Shortly after landing the pilots went below the aircraft to inspect something under the wing. [Since I was] not being given much information; I discussed the event with the fire and Maintenance personnel. The issue they described was much more severe in nature than I was told on the aircraft. According to Maintenance the light/message that came on indicated the possible loss of critical aircraft systems and could have been catastrophic if failure did occur on landing. This incident indicated serious problems on the aircraft that sounded; to me; like an emergency; i.e. 'Any event in which the safe operation of the flight is in doubt.' When the pilots returned from inspecting the aircraft I asked; 'What were you looking at?' The Captain replied; 'Nothing.' There was no official debriefing after the event by the Captain. The First Officer did try to inform us about what occurred; but the Captain seemed to be keeping him from speaking with us. After the event the pilots had a couple of extensive private conversations in the back of the aircraft when the only other people onboard were the other Flight Attendant and me. The failure here on the part of the Captain is addressed in our Flight Attendant Manual (FAM). 'The PIC will ensure the flight attendants are advised as to the extent of the emergency or irregular operation.' None of the SOP briefing items were discussed and they should have been as this was; at the very least; an abnormal situation. The time between the Captain's call to me and our landing would have been more than sufficient to prepare the cabin for an abnormal landing. As stated in our manual; 'In an emergency; flight attendants are responsible for ensuring the safety of the passengers and preserving the integrity of the cabin.' With the information provided and the attitude of the Captain appearing to discourage communication; I did not feel I could do so. There was a critical failure of the communication process between crew members of this event. There was a lack of CRM during this abnormal/emergency situation. Throughout the whole beginning of the trip the Captain acted like it was a large strain to communicate with us and that attitude extended into this emergency situation in the air. The cabin crew and passengers were given identical sets of information over the PA and even the experienced fliers onboard knew something was not right. I had quite a few people ask me directly; 'We could tell the pilot was lying; what really happened?' and my honest answer was that I was not given any other information.,,,,A Flight Attendant aboard an ERJ-170 reported the Captain failed to properly brief and prepare the aircraft for what the reporter later determined had been a possibly serious anomaly for which the flight diverted to a nearby airport where they were met by CFR and maintenance personnel.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant aboard an ERJ-170 who reported that the Captain failed to properly brief and prepare the cabin crew for an emergency situation. The flight was diverted to a nearby airport due to a message alert indicating a potential loss of critical aircraft systems, which could have been catastrophic. Despite the severity of the situation, the Captain provided insufficient information to the cabin crew, did not follow standard operating procedures (SOP) for emergencies, and appeared to discourage communication with the flight attendants. This led to a breakdown in communication and a lack of Crew Resource Management (CRM) during the abnormal situation. After landing, maintenance personnel revealed that the issue was more severe than initially communicated. The Captain's failure to debrief the cabin crew and the First Officer's apparent restraint from sharing information further exacerbated the situation. The Flight Attendant noted that the lack of transparency and poor communication strained the crew's ability to ensure passenger safety and maintain cabin integrity.",between attendant and crew

I say what for I am not on reserve. I also say; how can I do that we are ready to leave the main cabin door is closed. The Captain states it is OK we are now on maintenance. I changed positions with B and retrieve my phone and turn it on even though the entire cabin has their phones off. Crew Scheduling stated there had been a change to my scheduling. I tell them that I am not on reserve. They say they know that. I tell them I won't do it. We continue to talk and then I ask for the Supervisor of Crew Scheduling. The Supervisor tells me tells me there is no one else; I am within duty regulations at that I need to do this. I tell her we are on maintenance and to get a reserve out there as we are now waiting for Maintenance to arrive and take the flight. I request to speak to a Duty Officer. The Duty Officer is unable to speak with me as now we are leaving. I listen to the Duty Officer message after landing asking me please; to save the flight for these people. There is a huge lack of communication. Upon arrival there is an injured Flight Attendant in a wheelchair. Against my own better judgment I do the flight. We landed after midnight. During the flight I truly realize that I am not safe to do the flight. I am exhausted over the turbulence and sleep deprivation. Flight Attendant B who was in the previous turbulence that downed the aircraft states that her neck is stiff and that she probably should not have flown the flight either. I felt pushed by the Company to take one for the team knowing it was not a safe situation for me.,,,,A Q400 Flight Attendant felt forced to work an additional flight after her normal sequence because of another flight attendant's injury but realized later that she was fatigued to the point of not being safe.,"A Q400 flight attendant was pressured by the airline to work an additional flight after her normal sequence concluded due to another flight attendant's injury.

We followed the appropriate procedures and declared an emergency with ATC and landed the aircraft successfully. During the Flight Attendant briefing I informed them of the condition of the aircraft and the time remaining to landing; however; I missed a couple of items. Specifically I should have given them a better brief on what to expect once we landed and after the aircraft came to a stop.After landing I announced 'Flight Attendants to their stations'. Some time later; only after CFR had inspected the aircraft; did I then announce that they should 'Remain Seated' as we taxied to the gate.After I gave the emergency brief in flight; I turned the cabin volume control down. I thought I turned it down all the way; but I did not. After the aircraft came to a stop I could hear the conversation between Flight Attendants. It sounded like they were confused about being on the runway and what was taking so long for further instructions from me. I was concerned that they would evacuate the aircraft with so much time not hearing from the flight deck once the airplane was on the ground. Overhearing what sounded like confused conversation between them I decided that; if there is a next time; I will give a more detailed brief to the Flight Attendants on what to expect on the ground.,,,,An A319 Captain discussed what he believed to be his incomplete briefing given to the Flight Attendants to prepare them for what would happen after landing when he had declared an emergency due to faulty flaps/slats. He cited his failure to keep them regularly informed as to their status and the progress of exterior inspections by CFR personnel.,"The incident involved an A319 flight where the flight crew declared an emergency due to a flap/slat fault during approach. The captain successfully landed the aircraft but acknowledged providing an incomplete briefing to the flight attendants regarding the post-landing procedures and the status of exterior inspections by ground personnel. After landing, the captain instructed the flight attendants to return to their stations but did not immediately inform them to remain seated until the aircraft was safely taxied to the gate. The captain later realized that the cabin volume control had not been fully turned down, allowing him to overhear the flight attendants' confused conversations about the delay in receiving further instructions. This led the captain to recognize the need for a more detailed briefing in the future to ensure the flight attendants were better prepared for such situations.",between attendant and crew

After the Lead Flight Attendant made his announcements; I thought I heard him say 'prepare doors.' I did so and began walking up the aisle checking on passengers. At this time; I realized that the front entry door and cockpit doors remained open. I proceeded to walk forward to inquire. When I arrived to the forward galley; a caterer came from the rear of the aircraft and informed us that he had popped the slide. We inquired if he was injured; and he said no. I followed him to the aft galley as he told me that he had seen the orange strap; but that his sunglasses had been giving off a glare and he had opened the door anyway. The slide had been fully deployed and was facing upward at an angle as the door was only partially opened. The gate agent; the caterer; and I placed the slide inside the aft galley so the plane could be taken to another gate and a new plane brought to our current gate. We immediately contacted the Captain and began to secure another aircraft; deplane passengers; and continue our flight. The entire procedure was done effectively and efficiently and we departed less than 50 minutes late and all connections were good.I am eternally thankful that no one was injured due to my misunderstanding and know in the future I will be on high alert and double check myself. In this job; there are so many things going on at once in an attempt to board passengers; stow their bags; do our duties and depart on time. Sometimes; I get caught up in repetitive routines like simply shutting the doors and preparing for the demo that I have neglected a very important aspect. I should have immediately returned to the aft galley and 'unprepared' my doors as soon as I saw the forward entry door was open. As for the caterer; thankfully he was not injured; however; I would hope in the future he will never attempt to open a door with the strap across the window.,,,,An emergency exit slide was deployed at the gate by a caterer when a Flight Attendant incorrectly understood the order to arm the doors had been given.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant misunderstood an order to arm the doors, leading to an emergency exit slide being deployed at the gate by a caterer. The Flight Attendant believed they had heard the Lead Flight Attendant instruct to ""prepare doors"" and proceeded to check the cabin. Upon reaching the forward galley, they discovered the front entry door and cockpit doors were open. A caterer approached and explained that they had intentionally opened the forward entry door, mistaking the orange safety strap for a signal to deploy the slide due to sunglass glare. The slide was fully deployed and facing upward, creating an obstruction. The Flight Attendant, along with the caterer and gate agent, secured the slide, moved the aircraft to another gate, and coordinated with ground staff to bring a replacement aircraft. Passengers were deplaned, and the flight resumed less than 50 minutes after the initial delay. No injuries were reported, and the situation was handled efficiently. The Flight Attendant acknowledged the importance of double-checking procedures and expressed gratitude for the positive outcome. The caterer was unharmed but was advised against such actions in the future.",between attendant and crew

The aircraft also had one MEL; the APU was inoperative; so we had to do an external air start at the gate. While taxiing to the runway; we performed a cross bleed start on the number one engine. Everything was normal during the taxi; beside the aircraft getting warm while using the bleed air to operate the air conditioning packs.We were in the takeoff roll; well past 80 KTS and approaching V1 when we received a call chime from the Flight Attendant. I was the pilot flying and decided to continue the takeoff; as we were within a few KTS of V1. While I was rotating the aircraft; we received a second call from the Flight Attendant using the cabin emergency call button. After raising the gear and configuring the aircraft; the First Officer answered the call. She said; 'There's smoke in the cabin; down the floor aisle.' We immediately informed Tower of the situation and that we would like to return. At the same time; the Flight Attendant called back saying she was seeing smoke coming out from along the aisle; down around where the emergency lights are. I asked her if it smelled like smoke; a burning smell; or an electrical smell. She went to investigate and then call us back.We were still on the SID and I had started to level off back down to 3;000 FT.The Flight Attendant called back and said that there is no smell at all; the smoke is like a mist; and it is cold air coming out. Tower at this time asked us if we would like to land on [Runway] XXR or YYR. We informed the Tower that we were still analyzing the problem; so he sent us to Departure. We contacted Departure and he had us fly heading 185 degrees and climb to 4;000 FT.The Flight Attendant called us to say that the smoke had gone away; but as soon as I added thrust to climb to 4;000 FT the smoke reappeared. I asked if there was any smell again and she said no; and [that] it was still cold air coming out. All this happened in a very short time frame. At this time we realized that it was not smoke; but condensation coming from the air conditioning packs. We had received no indications of anything abnormal in the cockpit; no EICAS messages; and all readings on the systems page of the MFD were normal. The cabin was warm and humid from the taxi out; so the temperature control was set to cold on the Flight Attendant control panel.At this point; Departure asked us what we wanted to do. We talked about that if we returned we would have to perform an overweight landing; around 4;500 LBS overweight. We decided it was safe to continue the flight. Departure gave us a heading to rejoin the SID; which put us on a heading that we could return if need be.The Flight Attendant called us back to say the condensation was gone and had not returned. At no time while talking with Tower or Departure did we declare an emergency; only saying initially to the Tower that we needed to return to the airport. That was before we had all the information about what was happening in the cabin. Only after evaluating the facts did we decide not to return.Concentrating on planning a return overweight landing while running checklists; coordinating with ATC; and communicating with the Flight Attendant can lead to missed steps. I must continue to stay vigilant and not rush through things while also maintaining the safety of the aircraft; passengers; and crew. Also; [while] not dismissing the Flight Attendant's call; [I should] not be distracted by it during the critical phase of takeoff (especially near or at V1) until it is safe to answer. I never want to discourage anyone on the flight crew to inform me if there is a problem or safety issue.,,To prevent this type of situation from occurring again; flight crew should be aware of the difference between smoke and mist from the air conditioning packs.,,An E145 flight crew continued their takeoff when the Flight Attendant called as they approached V1. After airborne the Attendant advised of 'smoke' coming from the floor of the cabin. The smoke eventually was determined to be condensation from the air conditioning system as it cooled the hot humid air. The flight continued to its destination when the condensation was identified and later abated.,"The incident involved an E145 aircraft with an inoperative Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), requiring an external air start. During takeoff, the flight attendant reported ""smoke"" in the cabin, prompting the flight crew to consider returning to the airport. However, after further investigation, the ""smoke"" was identified as condensation from the air conditioning packs, which was exacerbated by the warm and humid cabin air from the taxi. The flight crew ultimately decided to continue the flight after the condensation dissipated and determined there was no immediate threat to safety. The proposed solution emphasizes the importance for flight crew to recognize the difference between smoke and condensation from the air conditioning system.",between attendant and crew

This clearance was acknowledged by both pilots. As we approached this hold short point we were finishing up the PA and the Flight Attendant called. She indicated that we needed a wheelchair at our destination. The conversation seemed to be slightly longer than normal and so when the First Officer returned to the radio the Captain inquired if there was something wrong. During relaying this information to the Captain; the flight crew missed the hold short of L3. Air Traffic Control inquired about this and immediately issued a clearance to continue on Mike to hold short of 9L at M2. The Flight Attendant call was a distraction as well as fatigue in this instance.,,,,An air carrier Flight Attendant called the cockpit during taxi for takeoff requesting a passenger wheel chair at the destination; but the distraction plus fatigue caused a taxi deviation.,"An air carrier flight attendant called the cockpit during taxi for takeoff, requesting a wheelchair at the destination. This call, combined with crew fatigue, distracted the flight crew. As a result, the crew missed an ATC instruction to hold short of L3, leading to a minor taxi deviation. Air Traffic Control promptly corrected the situation, preventing any serious incident. The deviation was minor and corrected without incident. The event underscores the importance of effective communication protocols and crew resource management (CRM) training to mitigate distractions during critical phases of flight operations.",between attendant and crew

We were all in our jump seats and had been anticipating landing when I noticed that we appeared to be circling. We were still at considerable altitude; higher than normal for that phase of flight. Knowing we were in 'sterile cockpit' I just waited; thinking to myself there must be a lot of traffic this time of night because if there were any problems the Captain would let us know.Just then; the 'all-call' came over the PA. I answered and identified myself. The Captain answered and said; 'We have a problem with our flaps not deploying the usual way so we have to get them down another way that just takes some time. I guess you could call this a simple 'heads up' because I anticipate a completely normal landing and there is nothing to worry about.' I said; 'Okay; thank you;' and then confirmed my crew had heard our exchange.We landed without incident; although CFR was at the ready down the runway. Upon deplaning; some passengers were curious as to why it took so long to land. I stated it was just traffic. I did not feel there was any need to alarm these passengers in any way when all was okay. There was only one passenger who challenged me by stating that he saw the fire equipment and that the flaps were still completely down even at the gate; so it wasn't just traffic.After landing and debriefing with my crew I explained what I thought had occurred and confirmed with the two flight attendants at door 4 that they both had said 'yes' when I asked if they heard the information. Unfortunately; we did not identify which doors had heard the info. I think in an effort to proctor excellent communication with all crew members when a situation that involves all crew members needing to be informed; that a new procedure [be implemented] to acknowledge receipt of the information door by door. That way if the Purser does not hear confirmation from all exits; he/she knows to relay the information to anyone who did not pick up the interphone.Upon turning on my phone on the way to the parking lot I listened to a very concerned message from a Supervisor who knew of the situation and wanted to be certain that the crew was okay. I returned her call and assured her that there was nothing out of the ordinary on landing. The Captain did not advise us to brief the cabin; it was merely a 'heads up' for the Flight Attendants and we landed without incident.,,,,Incomplete dissemination of information regarding a flap extension problem; which delayed the landing of a B757-200; left some passengers concerned; and some Flight Attendants uninformed.,"The incident involved a flap deployment issue on a B757-200 flight, which led to a delayed landing. The captain informed the flight attendants of the problem via the public address system, describing it as a minor issue that would not affect the landing. The flight attendant relayed the information to her crew and ensured they were prepared for landing. However, the delay caused some passengers to notice fire equipment on the ground, leading to questions about the situation. One passenger raised concerns about the flaps not being down, suggesting the delay was not due to traffic. After landing, the flight attendant debriefed her crew and realized that not all crew members may have received the initial communication. To address this, she proposed implementing a new procedure requiring each crew member to acknowledge receipt of information door by door, ensuring everyone is informed in similar situations. The incident concluded safely with no further issues, and the captain and crew confirmed that the landing was uneventful.",between attendant and crew

The flight time was 38 minutes. The Purser was helping in the back and asked if we heard the double chimes. All four of the coach flight attendants did not hear it. I told her to go ahead and make the arrival announcement but she said that she did not feel comfortable doing so with the seatbelt sign not on.Later the Captain made the seatbelt sign announcement and illuminated the seatbelt sign. I checked seatbelts and returned to the galley and my jumpseat. We were over the water then. Later still the Purser made the arrival announcement. We made our safety checks. I was locking door three lavatories and I looked outside to see the runway. I saw jumpseat at 3R was vacant but did not want to sit in someone else's jumpseat if they could make it back to it. I landed in the aisle standing up between doors three and four. There were at least 3 other flight attendants standing on arrival as well. As soon as the airplane slowed I made it back to my jumpseat and strapped in. The Purser and the Captain were well aware of what happened. The Purser said that she wished that she listened to her gut instinct and made the arrival announcement when she heard the double chime or called the cockpit to see if they did in fact ring the double chime since the rest of us did not hear it. We would like to still have the 'flight attendant prepare for landing' announcement which we are so used to. We do need to have the arrival announcement made earlier. It would be great if the double chimes and the seat belt sign would go off together and we could do the arrival and safety checks then. We need to be more aware of this issue to not have it repeated in the future.,,,,A breakdown in communication between the flight and cabin crews as well as amongst the flight attendants themselves resulted in several flight attendants still standing and performing safety duties at touchdown.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between the flight and cabin crews during the final stages of a short-haul flight. The Purser, who was assisting in the back, initially heard double chimes signaling the need for seatbelt preparation but did not feel comfortable making the announcement without confirmation from the cockpit. Despite the Captain later illuminating the seatbelt sign and making an announcement, several flight attendants, including the Purser, were still standing and performing safety duties upon touchdown. This occurred despite the Purser expressing regret for not acting earlier and suggesting that the ""flight attendant prepare for landing"" announcement be made earlier, ideally in sync with the double chimes and seatbelt sign activation. The incident highlighted the need for clearer communication protocols and improved awareness among the cabin crew to prevent similar occurrences in the future.",between attendant and crew

The aircraft was in taxi out mode. The other Flight Attendant noticed that the safety strap at the L2 door was stuck in the door. I tried to pull it back in; but it would not budge. I saw some light coming through from where the strap was. I called the flightdeck; apologized for interrupting; and asked if they were showing any indications of the integrity of the seal being breeched. He said everything looked fine. I told him about the strap. I said that if he could stop the aircraft; I could quickly crack the door and bring the strap back in. He said it wasn't as easy as that because the aircraft was already pressurized. I then asked him what the ramifications could be if we left it alone. He said that it might cause a squealing sound on climb but should eventually go away when we leveled off. So; I said as long as there weren't any warning bells; and he was comfortable with leaving it; then I would leave it alone. I also said that I would contact him if anything happened. As soon as we took off; the door started squealing; and it actually got louder the higher we went. It could be heard full force all the way up to the divider. It was like a horn being blown. I waited until 10;000 to see if it would go away; but it didn't. I called the pilots; and they could hear it over the intercom without me telling them. He suggested putting a wet rag on it. That didn't do anything. No one was complaining about any physical reactions; except the other Flight Attendant was getting a headache. The noise was just so obnoxiously loud that it wasn't right to put the passengers through it. So; the Captain returned to the departure airport. On the ground; a mechanic from one of the smaller airlines; came and checked out the door seal; said it was fine; we took on more gas; and we left. Maybe emphasizing something like 'strap check' in the whole door closure routine.,,Excessively loud squeal from L2 Door caused by safety strap caught in door pressure seal. [I] elected to return to the departure airport to remove safety strap. Flight Attendant called us in the cockpit from the back of the aircraft while we were approaching the runway prior to takeoff to advise us that a safety strap was caught in an aft service/entry door. After a discussion of the situation with the crew and verification by the Flight Attendant visually and by cockpit indication that the doors were closed and locked; my assessment was that there were no associated safety of flight issues and no risk of damage to the aircraft. I discussed my assessment with the crew; considered the alternatives and the comfort level of the crew with the process; and elected to go. As is the case in situations like this; there were factors that biased my assessment that it would be OK to fly with the strap in the door frame. My bias factors were: 1. Previous experience. I had experienced safety straps in the doors of Boeing aircraft on occasion over the years; and had discussed with others their experiences. That basis of experience set my frame of reference to the situation. My mindset was that if there was no metal piece of the strap caught in the door; and nothing extending to the outside of the door; that we could operate with safety and without risk of aircraft damage. 2. Progress of flight and operational considerations. We were operating out of an airport without a Control Tower; with a limitation for one IFR or special VFR aircraft allowed to operate in the airspace at a time. We had our clearance; and had aircraft waiting behind us to receive their clearance after we exited the airspace. We discussed the possibility of having the Flight Attendant pop open the door and pull the strap in; but we were pre-pressurized for takeoff and I was not keen on the safety aspect of having the door popped open without stairs up to the aircraft. So the remaining option was to taxi down the runway and back to the ramp; shut down; bring the stairs; and open the door to clear the strap. That option also would have made it necessary to refuel to bring us back to our required fuel after the taxi burn; which at this particular airport equates to a significant wait time for the fueler to show up. Did I make the right choice? No. That was apparent to me immediately during climbout when the flight attendants called on the Service Interphone and I could hear the squeal in the background. I had heard pressure squeals in the past but nothing close to the loudness of this one. Would I make that choice again? No. What I will do and what I would share with other crews is that it is necessary to clear the strap from the door frame prior to flight. Doesn't matter if it requires a taxi-back; another de-ice; more fuel; ATC clearance issues; or any other operationally undesirable factors which exist.,,A B737's L2 door safety strap was trapped in the door seal after it was closed but the crew decided to depart only to return to the departure airport because of the excessively loud squeal.,"The incident involved a safety strap on the B737's L2 door becoming trapped during closure. The flight attendant noticed the issue and informed the cockpit, but the pilots assessed it as low risk, deciding to proceed with takeoff. During the flight, a loud squealing noise developed, prompting an immediate return to the departure airport. Mechanics confirmed the door's integrity, and the flight resumed after refueling. The flight attendant suggested incorporating a more thorough strap check into pre-flight procedures. The pilot acknowledged bias from past experiences and operational constraints, learning the importance of resolving such issues before takeoff to prevent disruptions.",between attendant and crew

I advised Commercial radio and a discrete HF frequency was arranged and the patch was made. An on board ER nurse attended the passenger; made evaluations; provided treatment; and talked directly to Medlink. Medlink advised that we could continue and to provide O2 as needed. The Flight Attendant advised that they were using the Therapeutic O2 bottle. The Flight Attendant later advised us when the therapeutic bottle reached 250 PSI and a decompression bottle was used. As we still had several hours of flying; we discussed O2 use; and operational restrictions regarding depletion of O2 bottles. The First Officer and I discussed that the safest course of action; regardless of O2 quantities; would be to remain at altitude. I advised the First Officer that I was exercising Captains Emergency Authority in the event any of those bottles went below the prescribed volumes in order to remain at altitude. I discussed an O2 use plan with the Flight Attendant. We discussed using one decompression bottle to 1;500 PSI; then switch to the other decompression bottle; and use it until depleted. Shortly afterwards; she advised me that the first decompression bottle was at 1;250 PSI. I told her to switch to decompression bottle two; use it to 1;500 PSI; then use decompression bottle one; and deplete it. My thought was to ensure the Flight Attendant's maintained full capabilities in their mobility bottles. Shortly after this discussion; the  Flight Attendant advised that they could use their mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. With this information we revised our plan to include the mobility bottles as long as they ensured the mobility bottles did not go below 1;000 PSI. ACARS messages were sent to Dispatch advising them of the O2 usage and the volume levels of the bottles. After the second decompression bottle was used to 1;500 PSI; two mobility bottles were depleted to 1;000 PSI and a third was being used as we began our descent. Upon landing we were met by medics and the passenger was transported to medical facilities. Once we were deplaned I discussed O2 bottle usage with the Flight Attendants to ensure I fully understood the amount used. I discovered that the therapeutic bottle was depleted to 250 PSI; the number one decompression bottle to 250 PSI; number two to 1;500 PSI; and two mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. Mechanics boarded the aircraft; were advised and we discussed the write ups of the bottles as well as the EMK. [We were in a] high workload environment in ETOPS airspace. Medlink event happened near a waypoint with need to arrange for Medlink; plot; and report waypoints; monitor Medlink transmissions via HF; and derive an O2 use plan with Flight Attendant's that would be sufficient for a number of hours. There appeared to be confusion between the naming conventions of each type of bottle and the amount we could use before encountering altitude restrictions. I thought that the Flight Attendant was trading the names of the therapeutic bottle and the decompression bottle. Once on the ground I discovered that both the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle were depleted to 250 PSI.,,,,An  Air Carrier flight crew depleted their cabin oxygen bottles below acceptable limits while treating a passenger who became ill near the ETP. There was confusion with naming conventions of the bottles and operational restrictions.,"The incident involved a flight crew and a flight attendant responding to a passenger illness requiring medical attention during a flight in ETOPS airspace. The flight attendant initially requested Medlink assistance, and the crew arranged for a discrete HF frequency to facilitate communication. An onboard emergency room nurse evaluated the passenger, and Medlink advised continuing the flight while providing oxygen as needed. The flight attendant used a therapeutic oxygen bottle, later switching to decompression bottles and mobility bottles as the flight progressed. Despite efforts to manage oxygen levels, confusion arose regarding the naming conventions and operational restrictions of the oxygen bottles. As a result, some bottles were depleted below prescribed limits. Upon landing, the crew reviewed the oxygen usage and discovered discrepancies in the bottle levels, including the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle being depleted to 250 PSI. Mechanics were boarded to address the oxygen bottle write-ups and ensure compliance with safety standards. Post-incident, the crew discussed the oxygen bottle usage to clarify naming conventions and prevent future operational issues.",between attendant and crew

I immediately called the flight crew to inform them that all the power in the galley went out and the overhead lights flickered in the entire cabin. They informed me that they had a problem with a generator and were about to diagnose the problem. The same problem repeated a few more times as we lost galley power and lights in the cabin. Later the cockpit informed the Purser that it was safe to continue the trip. I was concerned that we were over land and that I did not feel comfortable flying across the Atlantic with one broken generator. Another Flight Attendant called the cockpit to ask them how safe it was to continue. The cockpit was evasive and never said whether it was safe or not. It led us to think that continuing to fly over the Atlantic and gambling with our lives on this issue was not being cautious enough; especially since we were still over land at the time of the generator problem.Later; another Flight Attendant informed me that the pilots told him that we have seven of these generators and that only one failed. Nevertheless; it did not put me at ease to think that we were going to fly over the ocean even after raising concerns about the dangerous goods on board. Was the airplane safe enough to continue its voyage? It is not for me to say as I have no control over the issue but it sure raised concern as to problems that can be resolved over land and not while over the ocean. Failed generators should not be taken lightly when planning to fly over the Atlantic.,,,,After one generator failed shortly after takeoff; the flight attendants aboard a B777-200 headed for an Atlantic crossing failed to have their concerns about the safety of continuing the flight properly addressed by the flight crew.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding the safety of continuing a transatlantic flight after a generator failure. Shortly after takeoff, the flight attendant reported multiple instances of generator power loss, including flickering cabin lights and a loss of galley power. The flight crew diagnosed the issue but provided unclear reassurances about the safety of continuing the flight, particularly since the problem occurred while still over land. The flight attendant expressed concerns about the risks of crossing the Atlantic with a failed generator and questioned whether the aircraft was sufficiently safe. Despite the pilots' assurance that only one of seven generators had failed, the flight attendant remained uneasy, highlighting the risks of unresolved issues over water. The incident raised concerns about the adequacy of communication and safety assessments during critical flight phases.

I proceeded to get up and disarm the slide and remove the red strap across the window. I then turned on the POS to transmit and unlocked the lavatories. I left the galley and stood by the aft lavatories and watched the deplaning process. A few passengers came back to use the restroom. Deplaning was a slow process.When there were only a few passengers left another Flight Attendant suggested we check to make sure the slides were disarmed. I was not expecting anything to be wrong. She then turned and said that my slide was still armed but my red strap was undone. I was in total disbelief! I could not believe that when I bent down to disarm the slide that I did not. I have never removed the red strap prior to disarming the door. I have always been extremely careful in following procedures. I cannot explain why the slide was not disarmed. I can see myself bending down and disarming the door. There were no emergencies or passengers asking for things or anything to disrupt my routine. However; when I proceeded back to disarm the door the second time; I did notice that the hooks that the slide sits in when disarmed were loose. The bar was more or less just sitting in the hooks rather than needing to be pressed down. So now I wonder if I put the bar in the hooks but did not make certain they were in there securely and they slipped out. My error is that I did not double and triple check the disarmed door to make sure the bar stayed in the hooks and would not fall out. Another factor may have been that I was tired and ready to get off the airplane. What I learned in this situation was to just step back and review all of the procedures each and every time I am disarming/arming a door. Maybe it has become such a habit that I need to make sure I am absolutely aware of what I am doing at all times.,,,,A B737-900 Flight Attendant failed to properly disarm her emergency exit.

After completing routine procedures, including disarming the slide and removing the red strap, the lead attendant monitored the deplaning process. However, an alert colleague noticed the slide was still armed, prompting the lead attendant to re-examine her actions. Upon revisiting, she discovered the slide's hooks were loose, causing the bar to slip out. Reflecting on the oversight, the lead attendant attributed the error to not thoroughly securing the bar and possible fatigue. She learned the importance of meticulously reviewing procedures each time, especially ensuring the bar was securely placed.

This was a completely full flight; with 2 jumpseat riders in the cabin and 1 in the cockpit.  Shortly after takeoff; the aircraft leveled off.  I noticed that it seemed too early to level off and thought we would continue the climb out momentarily.  Instead; the aircraft started to turn.  I was still in my jumpseat; as we were under 10;000 FT. Neither I nor the jumpseat rider next to me ever heard; felt; or smelled anything different with the aircraft.  After a few minutes; the Captain made a PA to the passengers that we blew a tire on takeoff and we would have to circle to burn off fuel so we could return and land.  After his PA to the passengers; the Captain called back to the Flight Attendants to tell us we blew a tire; we had 30 minutes before landing; do not go through the emergency procedure checklist; and he did not anticipate evacuating but if we did the signal would be our standard.  While the aircraft was circling; we flight attendants did frequent walk throughs to make sure everyone had all bags stowed; electronic devices off; seatbelts fastened; and tray tables and seatbacks up.  Otherwise; we stayed strapped into our jumpseats.  30 minutes came and went with no other communication from the cockpit at all.  I call the cockpit to ask when we were going to land.  I was told it would be about 15 more minutes.  When I sit on the #1 Flight Attendant jumpseat; I cannot see out the windows.  I started to get worried because the Captain was so uncommunicative; I was afraid we would touch down and crash without even knowing we were about to land!  I called the Captain and told him to let us know when we were about to touch down so we could be prepared.  Right before we touched down; he called us and told us we were about to land and it was going to be rough.  I am not sure the exact verbiage; but the #4 Flight Attendant asked if we had one or two tires on the nosegear and the Captain made a flippant; curt reply to this valid question.  The landing was smooth and we taxied to the gate.  When I opened the aircraft door; a woman from Flight Service and a mechanic were waiting for us.  I was the only crew member Flight Service spoke with.  She asked if we were OK.  During this time; two fire fighters with silver suits came up the jetbridge stairs; stood on the jetbridge for a few moments and left.  I kept asking if we blew a tire; as nobody explained to the flight attendants what had actually happened.  The Captain did not let us know on landing if the aircraft was OK or broken.  After many repeated questions upon arrival at the gate; I was told that nobody knew what was wrong with the plane because we had all our tires.  The cabin crew and passengers were informed that we would be changing aircraft and to go to the new gate.  This emergency was handled by the cockpit very poorly.  Company procedures were not followed.  The passengers were informed of the problem before the flight attendants were told; which is NOT procedure.  I had to initiate contact with the Captain.  He did not keep the flight attendants updated on the situation.  We had plenty of time to have gone through the emergency checklist; since we had to circle for so long.  If the Captain suspected it was going to be a rough landing; why did he say NOT to do the emergency checklist?  If the landing was going to be rough; I believe it is procedure for the Captain to say 'Brace'.  We never heard the 'Brace' command.  I was sitting on my jumpseat; waiting to land on the nose and go skidding across the runway with flames shooting out where the nosegear is supposed to be.  The flight attendants were not kept adequately and timely informed of the situation.,,,,MD80 flight attendant was notified by the cockpit crew they were going to return after blowing a nose tire.  The Flight Attendant feels this situation was not handled appropriately by the cockpit crew; creating a confused situation for the uninformed cabin crew.,"The incident involved a flight crew and cabin crew on an MD80 aircraft following a reported tire blowout shortly after takeoff. The flight attendant reported that the Captain informed passengers and the cabin crew about the incident but failed to maintain proper communication with the flight attendants throughout the event. The flight attendant expressed concerns about the lack of updates from the cockpit, which left the cabin crew and passengers in a state of uncertainty. The situation was further complicated by the Captain's refusal to follow standard emergency procedures, such as issuing a ""Brace"" command or allowing the cabin crew to execute the emergency checklist, despite having sufficient time to do so. The flight attendant also noted that the Captain did not provide adequate information upon landing, leaving the cabin crew uninformed about the aircraft's condition. The incident resulted in confusion and frustration among the cabin crew, who felt the cockpit crew mishandled the situation and did not adhere to company protocols. A proposed solution would involve improving communication between the cockpit and cabin crew during emergencies and ensuring adherence to established procedures to better manage such incidents.",between attendant and crew

Corrective action had been taken; including replacing a temperature controller. We also could not control the pack valves with the temperature controllers in auto or manual. At cruise altitude; the left pack ran full hot and resulted in a duct overheat. The overheat produced a strong hot ducting smell in the cabin before it tripped and cooled off. The passengers and Flight Attendants were briefly alarmed and both pilots donned O2 masks and accomplished the Smoke/Fumes Checklists until we were sure the incident was from the duct overheat. Good air quality was regained and we continued to our destination. Here is the error that led to the overheat and smell: We discovered in the next few minutes of flight that the temperature controllers were cross wired. The left [temp selector] controlled the right pack valve and the right controlled the left pack valve. We caused the duct overheat by moving the right [temp selector] to manual hot to unstick a full cold right valve; but this caused the left valve to run full hot. Attempts to cool the left side with the left [temp selector] only kept the right full cold. When Maintenance replaced the temperature controller they failed to verify it was hooked up properly. A simple check with the APU running would have allowed them to confirm left to left and right to right.[There was] uncontrollable air conditioning due to Maintenance error. When replacing systems that are identical and parallel; Maintenance needs to ensure they are not cross wired. A Functional Test of the system controller should be required before the item is signed off.,Reporter stated he had a lengthy discussion with one of their mechanics after the flight arrival in order to give Maintenance a clear picture of the temperature control problems were. The Packs did respond to their Temperature Selector positions; once he and the First Officer figured out what was going on with the Left and Right Selectors. The gate Mechanic went up and checked the Canon plug connectors for the Temperature Selectors and found them cross-connected.,,,A Captain reports about uncontrollable air conditioning high temperatures at cruise altitude on a B737-500 caused by Maintenance error. Crew could not control pack temperatures with temperature selectors in auto or manual. Temperature controller had been replaced earlier; a Functional Check was not performed. New controller was found to be cross-wired.,"The incident involved a B737-500 aircraft experiencing uncontrollable high temperatures in the cabin during cruise altitude. The issue arose due to a maintenance error when replacing the temperature controller. The replacement was not properly tested, resulting in the temperature controllers being cross-wired. This caused the left pack to run at full heat, leading to a duct overheat and a strong smell in the cabin. The crew donned oxygen masks and followed smoke/fumes checklists to resolve the situation, after which normal air quality was restored, and the flight continued to its destination. The proposed solution is to conduct a functional test of the system controller before signing off on such maintenance tasks to prevent similar incidents.",between attendant and crew

Noted MEL 25-02c for 4R aft door Flight Attendant jumpseat no retract. MEL states that seat must be secured retracted with 'tape of a contrasting color' and that the nearest passenger seat must be reserved for the Flight Attendant; and placarded 'For Flight Attendant Use Only'. Commuter flight was 4 hours late; and I was 1.5 hours late for sign in. Aircraft was loaded and the crew and passengers were ready to go when I boarded. [I] gave a brief to the Purser; who was someone familiar to me; and asked if they had taken note of the placarded seat. She said they had; so we departed after completing all checklists. Logbook was properly filled out and placarded for the jumpseat; but I did not physically check the seat. Two hours into the flight we got a call that the 4R jumpseat would not retract. I asked if it had been secured retracted and was told it was not. Entered in logbook that seat was not secured in accordance with MEL. Later; [I] received another call that there was some misunderstanding. There had been an issue with a passenger seat during boarding; and the Purser thought this was what I had referenced in my brief. Since I wasn't there during boarding; I was unaware of this issue and it wasn't in the logbook; and none of the Flight Attendants were aware of the placarded Flight Attendant jumpseat. Apparently; the jumpseat had been secured with tape of the same color as the seat; and the tape had come loose so the seat was available for use; but it still did not retract properly. The appropriate passenger seat had been placarded for Flight Attendant use; but the Flight Attendant MANAGER; prior to boarding; had apparently assumed it was an unauthorized action by the Flight Attendants to obtain a crew rest seat; and removed the tape and placard. Hence; we departed using a placarded and malfunctioning Flight Attendant jumpseat. Once all this became known; the Flight Attendants secured the jumpseat as best they could and used the appropriate passenger seat for landing.,,,,Air Carrier Captain reports confusion among the cabin crew over a malfunctioning jumpseat that has been MEL'ed but not properly identified to the crew.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and the Flight Crew regarding a malfunctioning jumpseat on a commuter flight. The Flight Attendant identified a Maintenance Evaluation Log (MEL) issue with the 4R aft door Flight Attendant jumpseat, which was not retracting properly. According to the MEL, the seat needed to be secured, placarded, and the nearest passenger seat reserved for the Flight Attendant. Despite these requirements, the jumpseat was secured with tape of the same color as the seat, making it less visible, and the placard was removed by the Flight Attendant Manager, who believed it was unauthorized. This led to confusion among the cabin crew, as they were unaware of the issue and the proper procedures. Two hours into the flight, the jumpseat malfunctioned, prompting the crew to secure it and use an appropriate passenger seat for landing. The incident highlights the importance of proper communication and adherence to MEL procedures to ensure passenger and crew safety.",between attendant and crew

All takeoff bug speeds were verified in accordance with normal procedures. I was Captain and pilot flying. During takeoff roll; V1 auto-callout was announced by the aircraft 20 knots early. I eased back on the yoke and began rotation; when I realized I was below rotation speed. There was no pilot monitoring callout for rotation. I eased the nose of the aircraft back to the runway. I then rotated at the normal rotation speed and achieved approximately 10 degrees nose up at about 155-160 KTS. Everything else seemed normal. At 10;000 FT; after the sterile chime; a Flight Attendant asked me about the attempted rotation and set down. Her verbiage was approximately; 'What was that bump?' I explained what had happened and inquired if she heard any scraping. She said no. We pressurized normally and continued to our destination. At 3 hours into the flight (approximately); the flight attendants expressed concern that we had scraped the aircraft on takeoff; but were not sure. Upon receiving this new information; the copilot and I conducted the suspected tail-strike on takeoff portion of the QRH. We landed without declaring an emergency at our scheduled destination. After landing; and upon a post flight inspection; damage to the tail-skid was discovered. Dispatch and Chief Pilot were contacted.,,During preflight; I followed all normal procedures. The takeoff data V speeds did not automatically upload to the FMC. I manually inputted the correct V speed from the paperwork into the FMC. I verified they matched prior to pushback. There was no runway change from what I expected prior to pushback to what we received for our takeoff runway. During our takeoff roll; V1 was called early by the auto-voice. I think it was early by about 20 KTS. The Captain started a slow rotation. I knew it was too early; but was unsure of what procedure to advise him to stop rotation. I didn't want to say STOP or ROTATE for fear of confusion. He also recognized the problem shortly after I did and lowered the nose to the ground. Our takeoff then proceeded normally. After 10;000 FT; the Captain spoke with the Flight Attendant and she did not think there was a tail scraping during our takeoff. After about 3 hours more; the Flight Attendants decided we might have scraped some metal on takeoff. We did the QRH procedure for tail strike on takeoff and landed at our destination uneventfully. Because we suspected damage; we conducted a thorough exterior inspection and found some damage on the tail skid plate.,,A B737-800 Captain rotated 20 KTS below V1 when the autovoice V1 erroneously made the callout and then set down for a short period before rotating again. During the second rotation a tail strike occurred which flight attendants reported but the pilots did not immediately react to the report.,"The incident was triggered by an early V1 call from the auto-voice system during takeoff, prompting the Captain to rotate the aircraft prematurely. During takeoff, the Captain began rotating 20 knots below the required V1 speed due to the early call. Recognizing the issue, the Captain set the aircraft back down, then rotated again at the correct speed. Post-takeoff, a Flight Attendant inquired about a perceived bump, but the pilots initially ruled out any scraping. Three hours into the flight, the Flight Attendants expressed concern about potential damage, leading the pilots to consult the QRH for a tail strike. The aircraft landed safely, and a post-flight inspection revealed tail-skid damage. The aircraft sustained tail-skid damage but landed without emergency declaration. The incident highlighted the need for procedures to address early V1 calls and enhance crew communication during takeoffs. The investigation likely led to updated protocols for handling early V1 callouts and improving crew coordination to prevent similar incidents.",between attendant and crew

The Flight Attendant then attempted to remove power from the light; and being unable to do so; she then made the decision to employ and discharge a quick shot of halon in the associated light socket. I had asked the Captain if any warnings; cautions; or smoke alarms were activated on the EICAS or the lower lobe crew rest facility. He stated that there were no indications of any sort. Additionally there was no evidence of smoke permeating into the cabin and none of the passengers in the area of the rest facility reported smoke to the flight attendants who were on duty.,,The reading light in a B777's lower level crew rest area emitted a puff of smoke which a Flight Attendant then shot with halon. No fire or smoke sensors were activated.,"In a recent incident involving a B777 aircraft, a flight attendant detected a puff of smoke emanating from a reading light in the lower lobe crew rest area. Upon noticing this, the attendant discharged a halon fire extinguisher on the light fixture and promptly informed the cockpit. The captain acknowledged the situation and requested the attendant to turn off the light, though she was unable to do so. There were no alarms triggered in either the crew rest area or the cockpit, and subsequent investigation by the purser confirmed that the issue had been resolved. As a precaution, all flight attendants evacuated the lower lobe crew rest area. The captain then contacted maintenance, who recommended removing the faulty bulb. This was executed without complications. Maintenance logged a report regarding the incident, including the halon discharge. Both maintenance and dispatch concurred with the captain's decision to proceed to the planned destination. Throughout the remainder of the flight, flight attendants monitored the area, reporting no further issues.

It is very faint in flight.  I turned around and was prepared to keep the cockpit secure.  I saw that it was our First Flight Attendant.  He said that they had been trying to call us but the bells in the cockpit were not working.  We looked around and found that the handset at the back of the center console was slightly out of its cradle.  I was not aware that that silences all the call chimes in the cockpit.  We then had the flight attendants call us with the cockpit handset secured and off the hook and determined that it indeed does cut out the cockpit chimes when off the hook.  We flew on and landed as planned.  The flight was normal.  The man on the phone that asked for the report said there was some issue with my headset.  I don't know what that is about.  I was wearing the same headset that I have used for the last seven years; including all the check rides and flights with chief pilots and check airmen.  I have a noise canceling aviation headset.  It works great.  It protects my hearing and makes the HF radio clear and understandable.  It was plugged into the headset plugs in the airplane and I was monitoring 123.45 and 121.5.,The reporter states that the continuous chime announcing that the door unlock code had been entered was audible but not something that he had heard before and was therefore somewhat surprised when the cockpit door opened.,While in cruise; approximately 3 hours into flight; A Flight Attendant tried to check on our welfare; but we did not hear the inter phone chimes because the inter phone was not in its cradle properly or reset. Since there was no response from us; the Flight Attendant used the flight deck door code to enter the flight deck. I did not hear the door alarm. The cause of not hearing the flight deck inter phone chime was the improper cradling or reset of the hand set. Both myself and the First Officer were wearing head sets with both ears covered and I was listening to the HF radio and the common frequency for reports of turbulence; which I believe prevented us from hearing the door alarm.,,B757-200 flight crew is surprised to see the a Flight Attendant entering the cockpit to check on their welfare during a night flight over the Pacific.  The call bells were muted due to the handset not being in its' cradle and both pilots were wearing noise canceling headsets masking the door chimes.,"During a B757-200 flight over the Pacific, the flight crew was cruising at night when an incident occurred. The cause was identified as the cockpit handset being out of its cradle, which muted the call chimes. Additionally, the pilots were wearing noise-cancelling headsets, which prevented them from hearing the door alarm. The flight attendant attempted to contact the cockpit via interphone but received no response. As a result, the attendant used the door code to enter the cockpit. The pilots did not hear the door alarm, partly due to the headsets and their focus on monitoring the HF radio and common frequency. The incident was resolved when the crew secured the cockpit handset, restoring normal operations. The flight landed as planned without further issues. The proposed solution was to ensure the handset is properly secured to prevent similar occurrences.",between attendant and crew

The Captain and I were both taken off guard by this because we were in sterile cockpit. However; we felt that there may be a safety of flight issue or physical threat to the Flight Attendant. The Captain looked at me to answer to the call. When I answered the Flight Attendant sounded nervous and distressed and said that a passenger was 'being disruptive; arguing with her and is on his phone. He won't turn off his phone even though I made three announcements. Do I have time to go back again and tell him to turn it off?' I said; 'No; we are in the approach phase. Stay seated and we can make an announcement.' After the initial call we were cleared for the approach and had intercepted the localizer. The glide slope started coming down. The Captain called for 'flaps 15' and I put the flaps into position. I informed the Captain of the issue and she said to make a 'loud' announcement that all electronic devices must be turned off. I made an assertive PA. After the PA; the glide slope was still coming down to be intercepted and the Captain called 'gear down'. I put the gear down and did the pilot not flying 'flow'. The Captain called 'Flaps 20 Before Landing Checklist' and I did the respective pilot not flying duties. I asked if we needed to make sure the Flight Attendant was seated and the problem was handled because we were unsure where the passenger was and if he was a physical threat. The Captain said 'yeah; call quickly to make sure' and I used the call button to call the cabin. The Flight Attendant answered and said that the passenger was 'not listening' but did not indicate that anything else was wrong and said he was in his seat. At that time; we stopped all communication with the cabin because we did not feel that there was an immediate threat to the approach or landing the aircraft. We continued the ILS 4R approach and landed without incident. Upon landing and clearing the runway we were instructed to contact Ground. Ground gave us taxi instructions to taxi via 22R; E; to the gate. Then; per standard BOS procedure; I took Comm 2 to contact Operations and get a gate assignment and the Captain monitored Comm 1. The Captain said we should have security meet us to handle the passenger. I agreed and asked Operations to have police meet the aircraft. We completed the after landing checklist; taxied to the gate; and completed the parking checklist. Upon reaching the gate; passengers were deplaned as usual (pending a 5 minute delay while we waited for security); the Captain contacted Operations; and I spoke with the police about the matter. ATC was NOT made aware of what happened because; after our final call to the cabin; we did not feel that there was a threat to the safe operation of the aircraft. Upon completing the flight we discussed what should have been done and what actions could have been better. We agreed that we should not have answered the call because the EMER switch (indicative of an emergency) was not used. Therefore; we should have continued the flight and assessed the situation further once we had landed. In the future; I will not answer calls initiated by the cabin during sterile cockpit unless the EMER switch is used to indicate an emergency condition. Answering the call only increases workload during a time of task saturation. I will also ensure that all crew members understand communication requirements and what is expected during sterile cockpit and emergency operations.,,,,An air carrier First Officer discussed the propriety of a call from a Flight Attendant regarding a disruptive passenger during approach and landing.,"The incident occurred during an ILS 4R approach into BOS when a Flight Attendant contacted the cockpit about a disruptive passenger. The call was unexpected as the crew was in the sterile cockpit phase. The passenger was refusing to turn off his phone, prompting the Flight Attendant to seek assistance. The crew decided to address the issue by making a PA announcement, continuing the approach, and landing safely. Post-landing, they requested security to handle the passenger. The crew later reflected that answering the call during sterile cockpit may have been unnecessary, leading to a decision to improve communication protocols to avoid similar distractions in the future.",between attendant and crew

We were level at 11;000 FT heading about 210 when both First Officer and I heard our callsign and instructions to descend to 6;000 FT and head 190. We were instructed to contact Approach on 119.4 and told of traffic at 1 o'clock and 10;000 FT. I stated to the First Officer 'I wonder why they would give us that clearance with traffic over there.' I had barely started down when the First Officer told me to level as she was looking at the TCAS and I was searching outside. I actually climbed the aircraft before getting the RA. People were deviating from LIT all the way in and also in the terminal area. The ATC Manager said those instructions were for another flight and that the Controller had issued them twice. We evidentially responded on the second call but we were blocked by the other flight responding. This was the second 84 plus hour month in a row for me having just completed a 4 day trip and flying 25.30 hours on that trip. I was assigned this trip in the evening and confirmed the deadhead out with crew scheduling. I had to sit in the jumpseat out because the dead head was made on an oversold flight and could not check in early for a seat. The agent said it was either the jumpseat or not at all. Crew tracking could not be reached (did not answer my call to resolve issue) I took the jumpseat and headed out. It was either that or not get there in time for the flight I was working out. Fatigue does cause one to lose that edge especially needed in the terminal area. I even question myself now as to why I would have even begun such a descent. If my game was on it would not have happened. With 4 days of early get ups it is not surprising that this could have happened. With manning the way it is I expect more of these types of deviations to affect the pilots at our company. Just look at how much flying reserve pilots did at my base and you'll get my point. I guess some would say that was perfect utilization of the reserves. Pilots on reserve know better. We are pretty much beat.,,We were deviating around build ups at 11;000 and unable to cross STONZ on BYP arrival. We had been coordinating with ATC. I (pilot not flying) stated that we were unable to cross STONZ. What I heard after that was fly heading 190 descend to 6;000 contact Approach which seemed very reasonable considering we were deviating and need to rejoin the arrival. I read that back and then the Controller said that we had traffic 1 o'clock at 10;000. I responded that we were looking and switched frequencies. I think I called twice. During this time I was looking at the TCAS screen and the pilot flying had started down. I saw the conflict and told him to level. He clicked off the autopilot and was beginning a climb when we got the RA. I checked in again and stated we were responding to an RA. After the Captain spoke with ATC Manager and we learned the clearance had not been ours. We had no idea the conflict was our fault until the tape was pulled. I have no idea how we mistook a 4 digit call sign for a 3 digit call sign.  I will be extremely cautious in the future. I just wanted to add that once we leveled and began to climb I did have the aircraft in sight. This was not an abrupt maneuver by any means.,,Air Carrier flight crew reports accepting a clearance to descend intended for another aircraft which results in a TCAS RA. Fatigue was cited as a factor.,"The incident occurred when a flight crew mistakenly accepted a descent clearance intended for another aircraft, resulting in a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA). The pilot, experiencing fatigue due to long working hours and a deadhead flight, descended after receiving the instruction. The First Officer noticed a conflict on the TCAS and instructed the pilot to level, but the pilot initially climbed, prompting the RA. The crew later learned the clearance was for another flight, issued twice by ATC. Fatigue was identified as a contributing factor, with the pilot noting the impact of extended hours on performance. The incident highlights the need for improved crew scheduling and management to mitigate fatigue-related risks.",between attendant and crew

After I determined what the problem was I went to the jet bridge to call Maintenance Control. At the same time there was a Flight Attendant using the other phone on the jet bridge. As I was talking the Flight Attendant paused her conversation to ask me if it was OK to board the aircraft. I replied; 'No; it is not OK to board; please hold boarding'. She then advised the gate agent 'the mechanic said no; it is not OK to board'.After I finished my conversation with Maintenance Control; I went back to the cockpit to inform the Captain. I also informed the flight crew and the flight attendants that I had to go down in the E&E compartment to do a 'BITE' test on the IRU; and for them to not let any one near this area. At that point I proceed to go to the E&E compartment through the floor entrance.Shortly after I entered the E&E compartment I heard a noise. I looked to my right and discovered that someone had fallen into the E&E compartment. I asked the passenger if he was OK and he confirmed that he was. At that point I called out for help. After what seemed to be a minute or two the passenger stood up. I asked him again if he was OK and he said 'yes; I am OK'. At that point I watched him as he climbed out of the E&E compartment.,,The Captain attempted to help the individual who became belligerent and non-compliant to instructions from both him and the Purser.,,A Mechanic who needed to access the E&E compartment of a B767-300ER asked that boarding be delayed until he finished his maintenance procedure.

I could see the Ramp Agent pushing the stairs to the aft door; so I made the announcement that we would be deplaning out both the forward and aft exits. Although the door chime had not been given; the Ramp Agent opened the aft door and gave me a thumbs up to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots never told us to hold passengers and I could see that the 'A' Flight Attendant had opened the main cabin door; so I let passengers start to deplane. I did not realize an engine was still running due to problems with the APU. I was having trouble getting my ears to pop and could not hear very well. The ramp agents never told me to keep passengers on board. Even after the passengers started getting off; the ramp agents continued to unload bags. I didn't fully realize what had happened until we were in the taxi on our way to the hotel and Flight Attendant 'A' brought it up. We all should have communicated better and the aft door should not have been opened by the ramp until the engines were shut down and it was safe for passengers to deplane.We need to stress the importance of the ramp [personnel] being aware of what is going on around them. The ramp [personnel] are the eyes and ears for flight attendants as we can't always see or hear what is happening outside the aircraft. Also making sure the cabin crew is more observant; not always counting on the ramp [personnel] to give them accurate info.,,Opened main cabin door and found #2 engine still running in cool down mode. Did not deplane passengers until #2 engine was shut down. Observed passengers deplaning from back door of aircraft before #2 was shut down.Discovered GPU unit had not been properly hooked up to aircraft. Flight crew had shut down #1 [engine] and was waiting for ground crew to properly connect GPU; so they left #2 [engine] running in cool down mode much longer than normal. Flight crew shut down #2 [engine] upon learning main cabin door was open.,,Unaware that the right engine was still running; awaiting ground power; the Gate Agent and Flight Attendant at the aft main door of a Q400 opened the door and deplaned passengers.,"An incident occurred at a Q400 aircraft when passengers began deplaning through the aft door without the right engine being shut down, due to insufficient communication and awareness among the flight crew, ground personnel, and cabin crew. Upon arrival, the seatbelt signs were off, but the door chime was not received. The Ramp Agent opened the aft door, prompting the Flight Attendant to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots had shut down engine #1 but left engine #2 running, awaiting ground power unit connection. The flight attendant, unaware of the running engine, permitted deplaning. Another flight attendant noticed the engine still running and shut it down after passengers had started leaving. Passengers deplaned while engine #2 was running, posing a safety risk. Post-incident, all parties agreed on the need for enhanced communication and awareness. Improve communication and coordination among flight, ground, and cabin crew. Ground personnel should act as the eyes and ears for the flight crew. Cabin crew should enhance their observational skills and not solely rely on ground crew information. This incident highlights the importance of clear communication and situational awareness to prevent similar occurrences.",between attendant and crew

During cruise flight; First Officer called Lead Flight Attendant (FA#1) to request a trip to the Lavatory. A few minutes later; Lead Flight Attendant called flight deck to advise that it was set up.  The First Officer got up; verified that the area outside of the flight deck door was clear and that the isle was barricaded; then opened the flight deck door.  As I was adjusting the oxygen mask and setting up the comm panel; the Lead Flight Attendant asked if 'so-and-so' could enter the flight deck (instead of the Lead Flight Attendant entering the flight deck) while the First Officer was gone.  In our crew; we had a new Flight Attendant (FA#2); who I had not previously worked with.  When the Lead Flight Attendant asked if 'so-and-so' could enter the flight deck; I assumed that he was asking about the new Flight Attendant as I could not recall her name.  I answered that she may. As I was testing the interphone function of the oxygen mask; I heard the flight deck door close and looked up and was shocked to see an employee of my airline standing on the flight deck with the door closed!  This individual is employed by my airline as a Customer Service Representative (CSR) in my base.  She was wearing her airline uniform and had her ID displayed on an armband.  I was stunned and somewhat shaken to see her and not a Flight Attendant.  I considered having her exit the flight deck immediately; but choose to minimize the flight deck door opening and closing by waiting for the First Officer to return.  Total time with this individual on the flight deck was approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  During this time; she stood in the aft part of the flight deck; adjacent to the flight deck door.  When the First Officer called the flight deck for entry; I had the CSR visually identify the First Officer through the peep hole.  I unlocked the flight deck door and the CSR exited and the First Officer returned and the flight deck door was secured. At no time did I intend to permit access to the flight deck an individual who was not authorized.  It was my understanding that the Lead Flight Attendant had asked if it would be allowable for Flight Attendant #2 to enter the flight deck instead of the Lead Flight Attendant as prescribed.  It was my intent to allow FA#2 to enter the flight deck as this was her second trip and I feel that it is important that the flight attendants are exposed the flight deck environment in the event of an emergency requiring Flight Attendant assistance on the flight deck. After this episode; I asked the Lead Flight Attendant why he would even ask if I would allow access to the flight deck of individual who was not authorized.  He stated that he didn't know that a CSR was not authorized to enter the flight deck.  I suggested that he review his Flight Attendant Manual and informed him that a security breech regarding access to the flight deck is a very serious matter.  He assured me that it would not happen again. This report is submitted to remind all flight crew members that flight deck access procedures are in place to protect the security of the flight crew members and the safety of the aircraft and passengers.,,,,A Captain reported that his Lead Flight Attendant allowed a Customer Service Representative to enter the cockpit while the First Officer went to the lavatory; instead of a Flight Attendant. The Captain did not know that the person who was entering was not a Flight Attendant until he saw the person.,"The incident occurred when the Lead Flight Attendant (FA#1) requested the Captain to allow another individual to enter the flight deck while the First Officer was absent. FA#1 intended to send Flight Attendant #2 (FA#2), but a Customer Service Representative (CSR) entered instead. The Captain, unaware of the CSR's identity, permitted access, leading to the unauthorized individual being on the flight deck for approximately 3-4 minutes. Upon realizing the error, the Captain addressed FA#1, highlighting the seriousness of the security breach. The outcome emphasized the need to strictly adhere to flight deck access protocols to ensure safety and security. The proposed solution was a reminder to review procedures and ensure only authorized personnel are granted access.",between attendant and crew

Why? Our inbound flight was delayed more than 2 hours so the turn time was very quick. The Agent was very hurried to get the plane cleaned and get it out ASAP. I was greeting passengers. When they were all boarded; the number three Flight Attendant came to the front to say [that the] exits were briefed. At that point we were all near the front door.The Agent closed the door and pulled the jetway and the Purser said to arm doors. Number three and I then walked to the back of the plane; planning to arm the doors. As I left the front of the plane I realized I had a personal problem. I walked back to get something out of my bag and told my partner I needed to take care of something and went to the lavatory. She; at that time; was also getting something out of the other lavatory for a passenger. When I came out she was in the jumpseat; so I put my bag away and sat down; forgetting to arm my door.Shortly after takeoff; I noticed her door wasn't armed; then looked at mine and realized both doors did not get armed. We then both armed our doors.We later tried to go over the reasons why this happened. I believe the number one reason was trying to rush our departure combined with distractions that happened right as we needed to arm our doors.,,,,Caught up in a maelstrom of activity and the need to address a personal problem as their departure was rushed due to a late arrival; two flight attendants aboard an A320 realized only after takeoff that neither had armed their door for departure.,"The incident occurred when two flight attendants on an A320 failed to arm their respective doors before takeoff. The cause was attributed to a rushed departure due to a delayed flight and a quick turnaround, combined with personal distractions.

The 'A' Flight Attendant and I told the Captain that we are on our first tray of drinks. We weren't able to take drink orders and pass out peanuts on the ground because as soon as the last passenger boarded the Operations Agent closed the front door. The Captain told us in five minutes it was reported we will fly into turbulence. We (flight attendants) asked the Captain do we need to stop beverage service. The Captain told us to continue to serve the passenger and he will call us back to let us know if it was safe to continue beverage service. Five minutes later the Captain called us and told us to continue service.After the 'A' Flight Attendant finished her last tray; she made a final descent announcement. The 'C' Flight Attendant and I hadn't finished our service. But when 'A' Flight Attendant made the final descent announcement; we stopped serving and went to the aft galley to clean up so we could be seated.The Captain called us and told the 'A' Flight Attendant that he heard her announcement and that we can continue to serve beverages. So the 'C' Flight Attendant and I re-poured our drinks. We (me and 'C' Flight Attendant) didn't realize how close to the ground we were when the Captain called and told us to finish our service. We were past the final descent stage of the flight; but yet the Captain told us to finish beverage service.The Captain never chimed for final descent in the final descent stage of the flight; but yet he chimed us to tell us to finish our beverage service. About two minutes after the captain called us to tell us to finish beverage service; we hit code four turbulence.We had a jumpseater on the jump seat; so the 'C' Flight Attendant got to the other side of the jump seat and I sat on the floor. Meanwhile the trays of beverages started to fall on me. Because we were in the approach stage of the flight with code four turbulence; it caused the trays of beverages to fall on me. The 'C' Flight Attendant made an attempt to make it to the front jump seat.As the plane was going forward; toward the ground; the can of beverages started falling out of the cabinets hitting me. I tried to close the cabinet doors so that the cans of beverages would not hit the jumpseater. Needless to say; I got drench by the drinks that were on the trays; I got hit multiple times by cans of beverages; and the aft galley floor was flooded with beverages.I'm not sure why the Captain told us to finish beverage service while we were in final descent stage of the flight. Maybe he was trying to impress (name) because he was on our flight. But whatever the reason was for the Captain to make such a reckless decision doing a crucial stage of the flight it caused a safety breach because while trying to close the cabinet doors we landed. If it is a 55 minute flight with expected turbulence; then the flight attendants need to remain seated and not do beverages service.,,,,Miscommunication between the Captain and the flight attendants regarding expected turbulence and passenger beverage services resulted in wet floors; wet clothing and exposure to possible injury on the part of those in the cabin.,"The incident occurred during a flight when miscommunication between the captain and the flight attendants regarding expected turbulence and beverage service led to a safety breach. Approximately ten minutes after the 10,000-foot chime, the captain instructed the flight attendants to continue serving beverages despite impending turbulence. The flight attendants were unaware of their proximity to the ground when the captain told them to finish their service, which occurred during the final descent stage. Shortly after, the aircraft encountered Code Four turbulence, causing beverage trays to fall and flood the aft galley. Flight attendants were struck by falling cans and the jumpseater was exposed to potential injury. The captain’s decision to allow beverage service during a critical phase of the flight resulted in a messy and unsafe situation. The flight attendant suggested that flight attendants should remain seated during the final descent if turbulence is expected to avoid such incidents.",between attendant and crew

He then switched us to SOCAL final. We checked in with SOCAL final and were immediately cleared for the visual approach to 24R. We read back the clearance; turned 10 degrees right; and began a descent to the normal 2500 foot alt for the LAX visual. Shortly the controller asked our heading and we responded 150. He said turn left 130. He then asked our altitude. We stated descending through 4500. He asked what our assigned altitude was. We responded that we had been cleared for the visual approach. His response was 'no; you were not cleared for the visual approach; you were told to expect it. Maintain 4000 and turn left to 100.' we responded leveling 4000; heading 100; and we understood we had been cleared for the visual approach and that was the clearance we had read back to him. He then vectored us to final and again cleared us for the visual approach 24R.  Although there was not much traffic; I distinctly heard two different controller voices on SOCAL final. So maybe there was some miscommunication in TRACON. And maybe the controller meant to say expect; but actually said cleared; I've been guilty of that. But I guess the bottom line is we heard the clearance and read it back and received no correction. There was no traffic conflict throughout this incident.  I think the controller(s) just made a mistake.,,,,A Q400 flight crew suffered a breakdown in communications with approach control regarding whether they had been 'cleared for' or were 'to expect' a visual approach to LAX.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between the Approach Controller and the Q400 flight crew regarding a visual approach clearance to LAX. Initially, the crew was cleared for the visual approach, which they read back and began executing. However, the controller later corrected the crew's altitude and heading, stating they were not cleared for the visual approach but had been told to expect it. The crew, hearing no further correction, adhered to their initial understanding. The confusion may have stemmed from miscommunication in TRACON, as two controller voices were heard on SOCAL final. Despite this, the flight proceeded without traffic conflicts, indicating the issue was a procedural mistake without serious consequences.",between attendant and crew

I then waited until the seatbelt sign went off and the cockpit finished their announcement to the passengers and called them. The First Officer answered. I asked him: Did the Purser call you and tell you that we were in the aisle doing our cabin safety checks because I was still in the aisle when you took off'. He said to me 'The Purser said give me two seconds. We were on the runway and if we would have pulled off then we would have had to wait 30 minutes'. I again told him 'Well I was still in the aisle when you guys took off. Thank you I just needed to check what had happened.',,,,An A320 crew took off with a flight attendant in the aisle performing the cabin safety check.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the flight crew of an A320 aircraft.

Despite the safety video not being completed and the cabin safety checks not being fully executed, the cockpit proceeded with takeoff. The flight attendant was still in the aisle when the aircraft began rolling down the runway and had to rush to her jumpseat to secure herself before takeoff. After reaching 18,000 feet, she informed the purser, who had communicated with the cockpit.

[We] arrived in ZZZ2 at 2111 with a 02 hour and 35 minute ground time before continuing to operate the 'red-eye' from ZZZ2 to ZZZ3.  I afforded all opportunity to get plenty of rest to prepare for the trip.  I stayed overnight at a nearby hotel; checked out at 1730 and proceeded to the airport for a 1900 check-in.  I completed at least 12 hours of total sleep prior to reporting for the trip.  Upon arrival at ZZZ2 from ZZZ1; I felt pretty good during the 2 hour and 35 minute ground time.  We left ZZZ2 for ZZZ3 at 2345 and both my First Officer and I felt alert.  About half way to ZZZ3; both my First Officer and I experienced the onset of fatigue.Symptoms included yawning; short naps; head nod; and reduced concentration.  We missed several radio calls from ATC.  I attempted to combat fatigue by placing the overhead cockpit lights to bright; but this reduced our outside visibility; then I selected DIM on the lights.  This helped initially; but we both continued to suffer from the effects of fatigue.  I had the flight attendant call us every 15 minutes to ensure we were alert.  Once we started our descent and approach into ZZZ3; our alertness increased.  This is due to the increased task of preparing for the arrival.  Total duty period was 11 hours and 8 minutes.I suggest the company not schedule more than one flight activity when spanning the hours of 0200-0500.  When a red-eye is scheduled as the only activity; I do much better since I can rest all the way up to report time.  Having to complete flying activity prior to the red-eye; coupled with a sit time in ZZZ2; is a recipe for disaster.  Even after I had afforded all opportunity to rest prior to the event; I experienced fatigue during cruise.  Had the effects degraded further than experienced; I would have had no choice but to divert to a location well short of our destination to get proper rest before continuing.,,,,An air carrier Captain related the debilitating effects of fatigue resulting from back side of the clock scheduling including extended breaks between flight segments.,"The incident involved a flight crew experiencing fatigue due to backside-of-the-clock scheduling, which led to reduced alertness and performance during a red-eye flight. The captain and first officer reported symptoms of fatigue, including yawning, short naps, and reduced concentration, which began approximately halfway through the flight. These symptoms caused them to miss several radio calls from air traffic control (ATC). The crew attempted to mitigate fatigue by adjusting cockpit lighting and having the flight attendant check on their alertness every 15 minutes. Alertness improved as the flight approached its destination due to increased pre-arrival tasks. The captain recommended that the company avoid scheduling multiple flight activities between 0200-0500 and instead allow rest periods before red-eye flights to prevent fatigue-related risks.",between attendant and crew

After being stunned I immediately strapped into jumpseat position #4 and we took off. When it was safe I returned to my position. This could have been avoided if the pilots would have given us a prepare for take off. Now apparently the reason we didn't get it was that ATC had lost our flight plan and we taxied around for a long time. It's my understanding this is what distracted the pilots from giving us the take off warning.,,Several flight attendants reported their flight began the takeoff roll following an extensive ground delay with no PA from the flight deck announcing the takeoff was imminent.,"During a flight, a delay occurred on the tarmac due to air traffic control (ATC) issues, which were not communicated to the flight attendants by the cockpit. As a result, the flight attendants conducted additional safety checks. However, the pilots initiated takeoff without issuing the standard ""prepare for takeoff"" announcement.

We conducted FL180 and below checklist with exception of altimeter setting. I informed Captain I would be off frequency to get arrival ATIS. He handled all communication during this time while hand flying the aircraft (autopilot not used). Very long ATIS due to air show requirements. I returned to frequency and as I looked up; I saw the altitude selector at 11;000 FT (per clearance) but aircraft was leveling 10;000 FT. Center at that point asked our altitude. I heard the Captain say; 'my bad I missed it.' I responded to Center; 'returning to 11;000 FT.' Captain returned to 11;000 FT and flight continued to our destinataion without further incident; but extremely busy due to high volume radio and aircraft traffic. I fly as a contract pilot with this company and am quite familiar with aircraft FMS/EFIS; and NAV systems but note the Captain tends to hand fly the aircraft in the highest traffic; highest work load times. Numerous times I have had to call out 'altitude' when he was flying and going off assigned altitude. I have pointed this out but Captain said nothing and evidently won't change his procedure. I will fly with him in the future but will encourage autopilot use and monitor his climb and descent profiles closely.,,,,A First Officer reported leaving ATC frequency to get the ATIS and upon his return discovered the hand flying Captain leveling at 10;000 FT with Altitude Alerter at 11;000 FT.

Upon returning, the first officer noticed the captain had leveled off at 10,000 feet despite the altitude selector being set to 11,000 feet. ATC contacted the flight, prompting the captain to correct the altitude and resume the flight without further issues. The high workload and manual flying by the captain were identified as contributing factors.

Flight attendants were not aware that the Captain was armed (due to lack of briefing by the Captain and lack of CLR). The FAMs did not know the Captain was armed (due to lack of CLR and proper briefing with Captain) and in turn the Captain was unaware of the presence of FAMs on the flight. In addition I as Purser was completely distracted from my boarding and Pre-Departure duties. I was not able to provide any safety and security vigilance that is expected of me during the boarding process. This was all due to the fact that our Captain became upset over me serving him his coffee with cream on the side instead of inside the coffee. As the result of this a confrontation ensued between myself and the Captain that lasted throughout the boarding process. The action taken by the Captain and the inflight supervisor was to remove me from the Purser position. My flying partner took over being Purser to appease the Captain. However that did not change the fact that the working crew (both flight attendants and cockpit) was unaware of the armed FAMs onboard and as well as the FAMs were unaware that the Captain was armed.,,,,An air carrier Flight Attendant reported flight attendants and pilots were both unaware that FAMs were on board; and the flight attendants and FAMs were unaware the Captain was an FFDO.  Problem reportedly stemmed from lack of communication resulting from friction between the purser and the Captain before departure.,"The incident occurred due to a lack of communication and briefing between the flight crew, specifically the purser, and the captain. The purser was unaware of the presence of armed Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) on board and the fact that the captain was an FFDO (Federal Flight Deck Officer). Similarly, the FAMs were also unaware of the captain's status. The issue originated from a disagreement between the purser and the captain regarding the serving of coffee, which distracted the purser from their duties and led to a confrontation during the boarding process. As a result, the captain and in-flight supervisor removed the purser from their position, and the purser's partner took over.

Approx 5 min later First Officer received a call from the cabin that the passenger passed out in the Flight Attendant's arms and that they were searching for medical professional on board.  Before the First Officer was able to get any additional information the Flight Attendant that called hung up.  The First Officer briefed me on the current situation. I instructed him to prepare for a possible diversion.  I got the ops freq for him and we set the FMS for the diversion. I then took over ATC comm and instructed the First Officer to get more information from the Flight Attendants on the age/sex of passenger name or seat assignment etc in case we needed to make a medical phone patch call. While he was talking to the Flight Attendant I informed ATC of our situation and the possibility of diverting for an unknown medical situation with a passenger that has passed out in the cabin.  The First Officer got in touch with one of the Flight Attendant and received some basic information that the passenger was female; non English speaking; vomiting and abdominal pains with two RN's evaluating her. The Flight Attendant then hung up on the First Officer again.  The First Officer briefed me on the information he received and informed me that in his opinion that both Flight Attendants were in a panic. The First Officer and I discussed the situation and I instructed him that we were 45 min from landing in ZZZ2 or 10 min from ZZZ.  We both agreed we needed more info from the Flight Attendants and RN before beginning our diversion.  I received instruction from ATC to descend to FL320 and switch to another ATC controller.  I checked in with that ATC controller and advised him of the situation of a possible diversion to ZZZ after we received additional information from the cabin on the condition of the passenger. During my conversation with ATC I heard the First Officer inform the Flight Attendant that she needed to ask the RNs for more information on the condition of the passenger; needed a seat assignment at least; and to tell the RN's that we needed a decision whether to continue to ZZZ2 that will take 40 min or divert to ZZZ that will take 10 min. When the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant I informed him of our decent to FL 320 and switched to another center freq.  We again discussed the situation with the Flight Attendant and finished preparations for diversion to ZZZ.  First Officer got ATIS and we set up for landing on RWY 23 in ZZZ.  First Officer then received a call from the Flight Attendant with seat assignment of passenger and that the RN's agreed that it would be best to divert to ZZZ.  When I heard that on the Interphone I informed ATC of or need to divert to ZZZ for a medical emergency. ATC gave  us a left descending turn to direct ZZZ. I informed ATC that we wanted paramedics; ambulance to meet the Aircraft for a female passenger in her mid 30's with abdominal pains and vomiting. After the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant. I brief him of our ATC instructions; asked him to call the company and instruct them that we will be diverting to ZZZ for a medical emergency and to pass on the information to our dispatcher and that we will call him on the ground in ZZZ.  We then completed all checklist and when we contacted ZZZ Approach Control were given straight in to Rwy XX.  We landed 10 min after beginning our descent on Rwy XX and in the Gate; 2 min after landing.  Paramedics took the passenger off the plane and she was transported to a local hospital.  The First Officer suggested that he talk to the Flight Attendant's on the situation to evaluate whether we should continue the flight to ZZZ2 with them.  I agreed.  (First Officer is a certified paramedic) I contacted dispatch and gave him all the information I had and while I was on the phone with him I was handed thepassenger boarding stub with the passenger's name and passed it onto dispatch.  After I finished my call with Dispatch a Flight Attendant came up to the cockpit. I asked her if there was anything used as far as emergency equip the passenger. She informed me that just the stethoscope and blood pressure cuff out of the EEMK [Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit] were used and replaced into the kit.  The First Officer returned to the cockpit and informed me that he talked to both the Flight Attendants and they were more relaxed and he felt that they were capable to continue the flight to ZZZ2 and back to ZZZ.  A few min later Flight Attendant 1 brought up one of the Flight Attendant O2 bottles and informed me that they had to give the passenger O2 and that the bottle pressure was below 1500 psi. I was a little disgusted and informed her that it needed to be replaced or serviced before we can leave ZZZ. I told her that I needed to know all the equipment that was used for this passenger; and should have be told of this when I asked the first time. (Note at this time the paramedics had already removed the passenger and we had been on the ground for about 15 min.) I called Maintenance Control about the O2 bottle and later discussed swapping the O2 bottle with the other CRJ9 that was overnighting.  Contract Maintenance did show up at the aircraft and serviced the O2 bottle. After contract Maintenance had finished the servicing of the O2 bottle and took the maintenance logbook to sign off the writeup the first officer and I prepared the aircraft for departure.  The next two flights were uneventful.  After returning back to ZZZ for the overnight I was performing my shutdown checklist when the Flight Attendant presented me the inventory checklist for the EEMK [Emergency Medical Kit] and First Aid Kit.  I again was disgusted.  The EEMK showed that the all items were in the EEMK but she had checked that it was incomplete and serviceable. One of the First Aid Kits was used and the latex gloves were used and the kit was incomplete. I informed her that this inventory should have been completed before we left ZZZ for ZZZ2 and I should have been informed when I asked her if any emergency equipment was used of the O2 bottle and the latex gloves were used.  I then called Maintenance Control to defer the First Aid Kit and after discussing the EEMK with him he decided to defer both the EEMK and the First Aid Kit that were used.  I left the Aircraft at XA:30 local time.,,,,A CRJ diverted to a nearby airport in response to a passenger medical emergency.  The Captain expressed some concern about the professionalism of the Cabin Attendants' familiarity with the administrative aspects of the aircraft emergency equipment.,"The incident involved a CRJ aircraft diverting to a nearby airport due to a female passenger experiencing a medical emergency, including vomiting and abdominal pains. The flight crew received initial reports from the cabin about the passenger's condition, followed by a request for medical assistance. The cabin crew's communication was described as panicked, with incomplete information provided during initial contacts. The flight crew prepared for the diversion, informed air traffic control (ATC), and requested emergency services at the diversion airport. The aircraft landed at ZZZ, where paramedics transported the passenger to a hospital. Following the landing, the flight crew discovered that emergency oxygen equipment had been used and was not properly serviced. The Captain expressed concern over the cabin crew's handling of the situation and their communication regarding the use of emergency equipment. Maintenance was called to service the oxygen bottle and defer the First Aid Kit, which had been used during the incident. The flight crew also reviewed the inventory of the Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit (EEMK) and found discrepancies in its contents. The flight resumed to its final destination, with no further issues reported during the remainder of the journey. The incident highlighted concerns about the cabin crew's familiarity with administrative procedures related to emergency equipment usage and their communication during critical situations.",between attendant and crew

I was in the galley next to door two and there had been a jetbridge at door one.  When the door closed I knew that there was an agent on board still so I thought that there was a jetbridge at door one.  I didn't even realize that we had begun to push back until I heard a commotion and saw the Customer Service Agent in the aisle saying that someone needed to call the cockpit and tell them to go back to the gate and I looked out the window to see that we had begun to be pushed back.  We returned to the gate the Agent got off and when the jetbridge pulled away that time I armed my door and made the PA to arm doors to the rest of the crew.,,I was working Flight Attendant #6 in economy walking around closing bins; my exit row had been briefed as it was getting close to departure. I went to verify with my flying partner #5 is she had a chance to brief her exit row so that I could relay the message to the purser so that way he knew the exits at 4L&R were briefed. She had not done her exits and I started to go back to brief her exit (and I completed the briefing for her) and I thought I saw something moving outside. I was unsure if the plane was moving or if it was ground crew. I then noticed the aircraft was moving and asked did anyone hear arm doors? My flying partner at 3R said no she armed 3L&R. I went back to arm 4L&R as we were pushing back. I then ask about the agent that I saw in conomy that she was still on the plane. The captain came over the PA said we were going back to the gate to let the Gate Agent off the aircraft after they radioed to operations they were onboard. I then heard disarm doors. Then a minute or so later I hear arm doors and we continue with the flight. I ask my flying partners what happened that was in business they said the door was just shut without them being told it was ok. I asked one of the flying partners about how was cabin ready given when the doors were not armed. They did not know.,,In the quest for an on-time departure; B747 flight attendants report door closure and pushback commencement with a Customer Service Agent still on board.,"An incident occurred involving a B747 flight where a miscommunication led to a gate agent remaining onboard during the plane's pushback. The flight attendants were distracted, with one not arming the door or making an announcement, believing the jetbridge was still in place. The other attendant, focused on exit row procedures, noticed movement and realized the plane was moving without proper communication. The flight crew responded by returning to the gate to allow the agent to disembark, then arming the doors and resuming the flight.

The biohazard guys came on and found that a young boy had a temperature of 38.7; 38 being normal. They decided to quarantine him; his row; the rows in front and back of him; and something like 6 flight attendants; who had served him. One of them told a language speaker that a doctor was coming and would check him on board.  After about 20 minutes; the station manager finally showed up and said that to protect their departure on the 13th; the Chinese authorities would accept just one Flight Attendant. She didn't want to speak to me; and tried to ignore me; but I got involved in the conversation and asked where the doctor was; since this boy was only a fraction of a degree above normal; which may be normal for him. She didn't have a clue; and suddenly didn't seem to understand English anymore.  The purser and I asked her how they were going to determine which Flight Attendant would be quarantined. She said we should choose. We both said we would not do that; that we had no right to order someone to go into quarantine. She said then she would choose. When I asked her what she would do when that person refused; she again didn't understand English. I guess she's not used to people not obeying her.  Finally; the Purser said he would stay. I applaud him for doing that; but what makes this even more bizarre is that he never came into contact with the boy. I asked that station manager why not just send a customer service agent to go with the quarantined people; since they are local and speak the language. She didn't seem to understand my question...again.  Now here's the safety issue:  One of our crew members; who was completely healthy; was forced to go to a non-western hotel; where sick people were being held in quarantine; and given no bottled water (only purification tablets to use with tap water).

Biohazard personnel, led by a station manager, enforced these measures. The manager initially stated that only one flight attendant could depart, causing a conflict with the flight crew. The crew refused to select someone for quarantine, leading the manager to decide. The purser volunteered to stay, despite not being in contact with the boy. The Captain questioned why a customer service agent couldn't accompany the quarantined individuals, but the manager didn't respond. A safety concern arose as a healthy crew member was sent to a hotel with sick individuals, provided only with purification tablets and tap water. The purser's decision to stay and the Captain's suggestion for customer service involvement highlighted the need for improved quarantine protocols.",between attendant and crew

During briefing I sat next to the aft purser and I smelled alcohol on his breath. I spoke with my flying partner as I was unsure what course of action to take. Once I boarded the plane I spoke with the purser and said I smelled alcohol on the Aft Purser's breath and she said; 'Yes I did also and I said something to him.' When I asked how he reacted she said he really didn't react. As we began boarding I became more uncomfortable about the lack of action taken regarding this. I spoke again with my flying partner and he agreed I needed to tell the Captain and the First Officer.  The Captain asked to have the Purser sent up to the cockpit. She spoke with both pilots and confirmed what I had said and that she; too; had smelled alcohol on his breath. She also stated it was difficult in her culture to be assertive with a Japanese man. The Captain asked her to send up the Aft Purser. As the Purser and I exited the cockpit she pulled me aside and said; 'why did you have to say anything'? Now I was feeling extremely uncomfortable. I started to shake; wishing I hadn't said anything.  The last thing I wanted to do as an out of base crewmember is alienate my flying partners. The Aft Purser spoke with the cockpit; then proceeded throughout the flight to not speak to me and to get the aft galley's needed supplies through other flight attendants. I went back to the cockpit and the Captain advised me that since the Aft Purser had popped a mint prior to entering the cockpit he couldn't really smell alcohol and that he didn't notice any unusual behavior such as slurred speech or stumbling and he was OK with him flying. I told the Captain whatever he decided was fine with me; I was just doing my job and keeping everyone apprised of the situation in case anything happened. If I had taken the Purser position in briefing the outcome would have been different. I would have confronted the Aft Purser in the office and given him 2 choices ... go on sick leave or we go talk to the domicile manager or supervisor. I feel this situation was completely downplayed and I was made to feel like I was making a big thing out of nothing and this is unacceptable as a safety professional.,,,,Believing the Aft Purser to have been drinking alcohol; a Flight Attendant is distressed that she failed to receive support from her cabin crewmates for her pleas for investigation prior to departure.,"An incident occurred on a flight where a flight attendant detected the smell of alcohol on the Aft Purser during briefing. Concerned for safety, she discussed her observations with her flying partner and later informed the Captain and First Officer. The Captain requested the Aft Purser to the cockpit, where the Purser confirmed smelling alcohol but stated the Aft Purser didn't exhibit signs of intoxication. The Captain allowed the Aft Purser to fly, citing the use of a mint and no visible signs of impairment. The Aft Purser potentially being under the influence of alcohol, detected by a flight attendant.The flight attendant addressed her concerns with crew and management, leading to a cockpit consultation. The Aft Purser denied impairment, and the Captain permitted him to fly. The flight attendant felt unsupported and disrespected, while the Aft Purser avoided her, highlighting crew dynamics and cultural barriers. The main character felt her concerns were dismissed, indicating a potential flaw in handling safety issues. She proposed a direct approach if in a leadership role, suggesting a need for stronger protocols to ensure safety and crew support.This incident underscores the challenges in addressing safety concerns within a crew, emphasizing the importance of clear procedures and respectful communication to ensure passenger safety.",between attendant and crew

Approaching FIR received ATC message time-stamped XA:35Z instructing we contact ATC frequency 124.XX MHZ.  Crew acknowledged ATC instructions via CPDLC at time XA:35Z; and attempted voice contact per ATC instructions.  ATC MESSAGE EICAS memo message and SENDING CDU prompt remained displayed for what would be a period of 6 minutes.  After time-out period; CDU displayed ATC MESSAGE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED.  During this time interval crew unsuccessfully attempted contact ATC 124.XX MHZ. ATC sent a second datalink message after the auto-generated ATC MESSAGE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED FMC alert message. This read: 'Attempt voice contact ATC'.  There was no PRINT or SEND prompt to this second datalink communication; and this message was not recorded in the CPDLC log.  However; either this second ATC datalink message; or-- more probably-- the timing out of the first message; allowed programming logic to re-enable CDU send prompt; which the PF immediately selected.  This second response (to the first ATC message) is time-stamped XA:41Z.  Meanwhile the pilot not flying was successful with voice relay through aircraft on frequency to ATC; and voice communications were soon established with ATC on an alternate frequency.  The airplane ACARS system processes all Company and ATC datalink messages to and from the airplane.  At time XA:39Z we received; on ACARS; the first of three cabin write-up acknowledgments called in presumably by the Chief Purser.  Crew's observation is this co-incidental occupation of FMC datalink processor/buffering delayed ATC datalink communication.  As a crewmember on international flights; I have long been frustrated by some Chief Purser's habits of sending non-essential cabin items both without coordinating this activity with the flight crew on duty; and/or initiating sending no essential cabin items so early in the flight.  FOM states 'Purser will consult with Captain prior to using ACARS'.  Some do not.  Some are briefed; as happened on this occasion; by a Captain during preflight briefing; that using ACARS is appropriate and approved by the Captain.  This leaves timing of ACARS usage to the sole discretion of the Chief purser; and its use may very well be at a time in flight that the Captain never imagined. Additionally; Pursers are not trained to envision how cabin write-ups affect the dispatch ability of an aircraft in event of diversion.  I am not suggesting these write-ups not be recorded for the above reason; I am suggesting; however; that legality of dispatch makes it ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT that the Captain be advised IMMEDIATELY prior to using the cabin ACARS.  At any rate; if indeed the use of the cabin ACARS interfered with ATC communications; as it appears it did; a wholly unacceptable-- an unnecessary-- communication interruption can occur.  The use of the cabin ACARS must be limited to non-controller pilot datalink communications/ADS operations.  I believe this report is particularly important given a recent fleet communication regarding timeliness of aircrew responses to CPDLC instructions from ATC.,,I was the Captain on this flight. I was in the bunk asleep during this matter. I had briefed the Chief Purser that she could use the cabin ACARS for cabin write ups. The aircraft was approaching FIR and was given a CPDLC message to contact ATC on 124.XX. The relief pilots were unable to acknowledge this and the message timed out. In the mean time they had relayed communications through another aircraft and eventually got in contact on 124.XX. We believe the message could not get through to CPDLC because at the same time the Chief Purser was sending in cabin write-ups on the cabin ACARS. I need to make sure to have the Purser check with me for the appropriate time to do the cabin ACARS as this caused a delay in our being able to communicate with ATC.,,A pilot reported that the Flight Attendants use of the cabin ACARS during international operations interfered with CPDLC/ADS communications with ATC.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew, Air Traffic Control (ATC), and a flight attendant during international operations. ATC transmitted a message instructing the crew to contact a specific frequency, but the crew faced difficulties acknowledging this due to interference from cabin ACARS usage. The flight attendant used the cabin ACARS to send cabin write-ups, coinciding with the timing out of the ATC message. This interference led to a delay in establishing communication with ATC. The proposed solution is to restrict cabin ACARS usage to non-controller communications and require the purser to consult the captain before using it, ensuring coordination and preventing future disruptions.",between attendant and crew

I noted he was very excited; speaking with a difficult to understand accent; and coughing. I got out of my seat to look through the cockpit door peephole and witnessed the front several rows of passengers reaching for their masks and covering their mouths to breath. The First Officer declared an emergency with ATC and we immediately diverted to the nearest suitable airport. Total descent time was approx. 6-7 minutes. After landing it was determined that the fumes had decreased and the air had cleared. We taxied to the gate; deplaned and notified company of our location and situation.,Reporter stated that four passengers were taken to the hospital for examination and were released. Later investigation determined that a single passenger; an employee of another airline; had smelled something 'unusual' and decided to unilaterally access her PSU manually to obtain oxygen masks for herself and a companion. Doing so actuated the oxygen generator; alarmed other passengers; who attempted to access masks for themselves; engaged the concern of the Flight Attendants who attempted to assist them in accessing their oxygen masks; which resulted in more O2 generators being activated; more heat generated and the generation of a white haze; a by-product of the high heat emitted by the generators.  By the time the Cabin Attendants advised the Flight Crew the air at the top of the cabin was; indeed; full of 'smoke'; the passengers were scrambling to access their masks and the reporting Flight Attendant was alarmed and wearing a portable O2 mask while attempting to transmit on the interphone. The combined effect when viewed through the cockpit peep hole was of a near panic situation with visible smoke in the cabin.  The result was the declaration of the emergency and the diversion to the nearest suitable airport.,,,An A319 declared an emergency and diverted due to smoke in the cabin.,"The incident occurred when an A319 aircraft experienced the automatic deployment of oxygen masks in the front cabin section due to toxic fumes and haze.

The #2 engine's vibration gauge started to slowly increase into the abnormal range. We ran the QRH; and were only able to maintain the normal range at approximately 70% power setting. Because that thrust setting was too low to maintain cruise flight at FL 320; we determined it was necessary to divert to ZZZ. The flight continued with no other problems and a normal landing was accomplished. We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance to discuss the problem. After telling Dispatch where we were and that we needed an airport for diversion ZZZ was selected as the new destination airport and ATC was advised. An Emergency was declared. During the discussions; Maintenance Control advised us to follow the QRH and shut down the #2 engine. We asked multiple questions; but the only answer given was to follow the QRH. I asked the Maintenance Control person if he was even looking at the QRH for this problem and he admitted he wasn't. I asked him to reference the QRH with me. They still persisted to follow the QRH. We asked to speak with a Chief Pilot and the Program Manager; but our Dispatcher told us none were available and that a phone patch wouldn't work. During this conversation with Maintenance; we learned that the #2 engine had experienced this same problem the week before; and that the wrong engine had been fixed.  The rationale for our decision to forgo engine shutdown was the first caution note; printed in bold; in the QRH for Engine Fan Vibration which states; 'It is not recommended that an engine be shut down unless there is another indication of a severe engine abnormality; i.e; high oil temperature; high oil pressure or abnormal vibration is felt through the airframe.' All other engine gauges and parameters were normal and comparable to the left engine.  We did not feel any vibration through the air frame.  We also discussed that in the descent; the thrust would be back and would most likely remain in the normal range.  The descent was initiated for the diversion and we were able to control the vibration all the way to landing at ZZZ thus not needing an engine shut-down. Even though both the Captain and I had talked with the flight attendants about the diversion and possible engine problem; they never mentioned that the engine sounded louder than normal.  It wasn't until we were on the ground; that the aft Flight Attendant said that there was a louder than normal sound coming from the engine.  Recommendation Regarding Contract Maintenance. We decided not to fly the aircraft out of ZZZ due to multiple findings; including:  1) the fact that we couldn't verify the aircraft was legal to fly after corrective work had been performed on the wrong engine; 2) the very poor inspection done by contract maintenance. Even other ground crew personnel told us that they should not be trusted. It is our belief that the Contract Maintenance person never inspected the #2 engine. (We had questioned him how he looked at the blades and if he opened up the cowling.  He said he didn't open the cowling and that he had used the belt loader because a ladder wouldn't be tall enough to reach the engine.  We mentioned the belt loader was not on that side of the aircraft and he laughed and then stated 'You couldn't see anything from examining the blades anyway.'  (Yet he wrote in the corrective action of the log book that he inspected the blades).  The only time we were able to communicate with this person was when he finally came up to the cockpit for the run-up. After the run-up; he concluded that the engine was fine; and that we were good to go. Back at the gate; he took the maintenance book to sign off the engine; but had to come back and find out which engine we experienced trouble with. (This contradicts the fact he wrote that he inspected the blades. Had he inspected the blades; he would've known which engine had the vibe).  A decision to not use these contract maintenance personnel should be highly considered. Always get a Chief Pilot when requested.  We are encouraged from day one of CRM to utilize all our resources and we requested these resources but were denied access to them.  Maintenance Control often appears 'disengaged' to the problems the crew is encountering and the only answer they give to any questions for help or problem solving is 'Follow the QRH' even when presented with contradictory or unclear QRH procedures to follow.  Isn't maintenance there to help be a useful resource and problem solve?  Don't use this contract maintenance provider in the future.,,,,High engine vibration indications initiated an ongoing exchange with the commuter airline's dispatch and maintenance control organizations that the reporter deemed ineffective. Flight diverted and canceled,"The incident involved a flight crew encountering engine vibration issues, leading to a diversion and cancellation. After takeoff, the #2 engine's vibration gauge indicated abnormal levels, prompting the crew to follow the QRH. However, the suggested power settings were inadequate for cruising, necessitating a diversion to ZZZ. Communication with Maintenance Control was deemed ineffective, as they failed to provide meaningful assistance beyond directing the crew to adhere to the QRH. The crew elected not to shut down the engine, as the vibration was not severe enough, and successfully landed at ZZZ. Post-landing, the crew learned that a flight attendant had noticed a louder engine noise, which the crew had not detected. The crew identified multiple issues with the contract maintenance, including a prior incorrect engine repair and a lack of thorough inspection. The maintenance team's unprofessional conduct and inability to competently inspect the engine led the crew to cancel the flight from ZZZ. The crew recommended against using the contract maintenance provider and criticized Maintenance Control for its disengagement and lack of problem-solving support. The flight was ultimately diverted and canceled due to these maintenance and communication shortcomings.",between attendant and crew

Keypad has been deactivated - DOOR CANNOT BE OPENED BY PERSONNEL FROM CABIN SIDE. On board services: A. Flight Attendants must use Interphone to request cockpit access. B. EMERGENCY ACCESS FROM CABIN SIDE IS NOT AVAILABLE. C. cockpit two person rule must be observed.' I informed the purser of my concerns for SAFETY before briefing and he called maintenance.  He was informed that there is a code that the pilot can give for alternative access. I briefed with the Captain of any alternative ways for a SAFETY stand point and he stated that there is not any way to access the door under emergency basis at all. I didn't feel comfortable flying on a plane that I wasn't able to access the cockpit for emergency basis on for SAFETY. I called the crew desk immediately to inform them of my SAFETY concerns. I have been charged with a Did Not Fly action and delay of the aircraft for my SAFETY concerns. I hope that my safety issue is addressed for future administrative corrections and hope no one else will have to go through the difficulties that I feel I am being given to defend my integrity of being a SAFETY professional.,,,,A Flight Attendant reported concerns about lack of emergency cockpit access when the keypad entry system to the cockpit was deferred.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant who reported concerns regarding a safety issue related to cockpit access. The Flight Attendant noticed a maintenance defect on the keypad entry system to the cockpit, which was inoperative and rendered the cockpit door inaccessible from the cabin side. This raised safety concerns, as the Flight Attendant would be unable to access the cockpit in an emergency. The Flight Attendant informed the purser about their concerns, who then contacted maintenance. Maintenance responded by stating that the pilot could provide a code for alternative access, but during a briefing with the Captain, it was clarified that no such alternative access was available under emergency conditions. Uncomfortable with the safety risk, the Flight Attendant contacted the crew desk to report their concerns. As a result, the Flight Attendant was charged with a ""Did Not Fly"" action, leading to a delay in the aircraft. The Flight Attendant expressed hope that the safety issue would be addressed administratively to prevent similar situations in the future. In summary, the incident was caused by the inoperative keypad entry system, which raised safety concerns. The process involved the Flight Attendant reporting the issue, maintenance being contacted, and the Captain confirming the lack of emergency access. The result was a ""Did Not Fly"" action and aircraft delay, with the Flight Attendant advocating for future administrative corrections to address the safety concern.",between attendant and crew

She confirmed it was clear and I requested permission to start the number two engine from the Ramp Agent.  He pointed to the number two engine and gave the engine start signal.  A normal start was completed.  The First Officer completed the weight and balance form while I completed the CG.  The First Officer signed the paperwork and handed it to the Flight Attendant who closed the cabin door. I looked out to the Ramp Agent and requested permission to start the number one engine.  The ramp agent pointed to the number one engine and gave me the start engine signal.  I began to start the number one engine.  After a normal engine start; the Flight Attendant began to rapidly knock on the flight deck door.  As soon as the door was opened I heard the engine noise in the cabin and realized that the cabin door was still open.  I immediately shut the number one engine down.  I again looked up at the warning lights and did not see the passenger door light on.  It was not until I moved my hand to block the incoming sun light that I was able to see the warning light. The event occurred due to an environmental issue.  The aircraft was parked roughly facing to the west/south west.  The sun was still low on the horizon and shining through the First Officer's side window and onto the warning/caution panel.  As I scanned the warning lights I did not realize the sun was causing the passenger door light to be unreadable.  Had I seen the passenger door light on; I would not have requested permission to start the engine.  According to the Flight Attendant; while the First Officer and I were completing the weight and balance; the Gate Agent removed and stowed the prop tie.  He then proceeded to walk away from the aircraft.  When we completed the paper work and handed it to the Flight Attendant; there was no one by the door to give the paper work to; nor was there anyone to help her close the door.  Once we began starting the engine; she moved away from the door and began knocking on the flight deck door.  I do not know why the Ramp Agent gave me the OK to start the engine with the door open.  After shutting the engine down; Gate Agent came back up to the aircraft and took the paper work from the Flight Attendant.  The Gate Agent stated that he thought someone else had already collected the paper work.  The door was closed and the engine was restarted.  The remainder of the flight was uneventful.,,,,A DHC-8 Captain started the left engine with the passenger door still open.,"The incident occurred during the pre-flight procedures of a DHC-8 aircraft. The Captain requested permission to start the number one engine after completing the weight and balance paperwork. However, the passenger door warning light was unreadable due to sunlight reflecting on the panel, and the Captain did not notice the door was open. The Flight Attendant noticed the door was open and knocked on the flight deck door to alert the crew. The Captain immediately shut down the engine. The Gate Agent, who had earlier removed and stowed the prop tie, returned to the aircraft and collected the paperwork, allowing the door to be properly closed. The engine was restarted, and the remainder of the flight proceeded without further issues. The incident was attributed to an environmental factor (sunlight) and the absence of ground personnel monitoring the door after collecting the paperwork.",between attendant and crew

Spoke to the Purser about this because there had been no information for passenger on oxygen on our briefing sheet. Later a passenger service representative boarded; letting us know that; indeed; we would have a passenger on oxygen. Fortunately; the agent had seen the passenger in the boarding area and saw that the passenger would not be using a nasal cannula but a trachea cannula instead. Everything on the aircraft had been incorrectly set up for a nasal cannula.  The agent redid the hoses and explained how to change the tanks.  The passenger was with his family and a paramedic in the boarding area but the paramedic was not allowed to board per a TSA officer even though the Captain had allowed it.  So; five minutes before departure the passenger is hastily boarded; along with his wife and 2 daughters who are traveling with him. I am given no additional/further medical information and am trying to communicate with people who speak limited English. One of the daughters questions me if the flight goes all the way to Vietnam. I tell her the flight number does but that everyone needs to deplane in VHHH. She becomes worried and says her father needs to stay on the oxygen and that they had been told that they wouldn't have to deplane. She makes a quick phone call and I speak to the Doctor. She is concerned about the VHHH stop because they had NOT been told about this. I assured them that they would have oxygen in VHHH and that everything was already taken care of because the computer booking would have alerted someone that this wasn't a nonstop flight. The doors were already closed at this time so I told the daughter that we would follow through and confirm with VHHH later on during the flight. I spoke with the Purser about this and we both felt it was important to follow up with VHHH because everything else related to our passenger had been very unorganized and mismanaged. Luckily; we had a Flight Attendant that spoke Vietnamese.  I asked her to speak to the family after takeoff and reassure them that the oxygen would have already been prearranged in VHHH.  Later; when the Vietnamese literate Flight Attendant was on her break; our passenger needed to use the bathroom.  I tried to communicate with the family to see how long he could be without oxygen and I couldn't really get a straight answer because of the language barrier. I erred on the side of caution and we strapped a portable oxygen bottle around the daughter who was assisting her father to the bathroom. The Purser had communicated to the cockpit the need for verification that we would have oxygen for the passenger in VHHH. Eventually; the cockpit received a message that the passenger had been advised in their PNR that there would be no oxygen in VHHH!!!!! And if they need it; it would be $250 USD. The Vietnamese speaker spoke to the family and they became a bit upset because here we are getting close to landing and we are making last minute arrangements for oxygen. Upon landing someone comes down the aisle with an aisle wheel chair and no oxygen. I had to forcefully let them know our passenger could not be moved without oxygen. The Purser; myself and a few of the economy flight attendants stayed on board for 40 minutes with the passenger and his family while company customer service representatives explained to the family that the price of the oxygen would be around $500 USD!!!!! This was due to the cost of a Doctor or Nurse needing to be there and there was a minimum charge for a set number of hours. The family became very distressed. The father was on his deathbed and this was his last flight so he could die in Vietnam and they had been given wrong information. It was devastating for us to see how poorly this family had been treated by our Company. More importantly; it was dangerous that someone didn't follow throughproperly. This family was basically shoved on the airplane without proper medical information ever being gathered and placed in his computer record and communicated to the crew.  Subsequently; the paramedic should have been allowed to board.  By to let the paramedic board; important medical information was not able to be conveyed to the crew due to the language barrier.,,,,A Purser relates her concerns about the services provided a passenger traveling with special medical needs.,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",between attendant and crew

My flying partner was behind me in the cabin and I assumed she would arm both upper deck doors as I disposed of the glasses and cleaned and secured the galley in preparation for departure. I was not aware that she had left the upper deck.  After the safety video was finished I checked the cabin; closing some sidewall bins checking seats and seatbelts and instructing a few passengers seated by the exits to open the window shades. I double checked the galley then sat in my jumpseat and fastened my seatbelt. My flying partner was still back in the galley area at this point and I asked her to double check to make sure the window shades by the exit were open. After take-off I noticed the window shades were still down so I went up to her jumpseat and quietly told her why the window shades had to be open. She said she forgot; then she thanked me for arming the doors for take off. I looked up at the door and was horrified to see it was not armed and the other door was also disarmed.  We armed the doors and I reported it to the cockpit and the purser. Full staffing for the upper deck is two flight attendants--one committed to the aisle; the other in the galley. It is hard work in the best of circumstances and doubly so when one attendant is not working at 100%. In this particular situation I realized in the first few minutes of working together before passenger boarding that I would be doing much of her work in addition to all of mine. This proved to be the case when passengers started to board.  While organizing the galley; talking with the cockpit crew regarding meals and security I was also hanging coats; stowing luggage in the closet and serving predeparture beverages. By the time the 'prepare for departure' announcement was made it seemed like I was going in 10 different directions. The door at upper deck right was my assignment. I did the preflight safety check according to the manual when I boarded and it was my responsibility to either arm the door for departure or make sure it was armed. I failed to do this on this day. I can assure you I double checked the door was disarmed upon arrival at our destination; armed for our departure home and disarmed after our arrival.,,,,A B747-400 flight attendant assumed her flying partner would arm her assigned emergency exit when she was busy with other duties.  So did her flying partner.  The flight took off with two exits disarmed.,"The incident involved two flight attendants on a B747-400 aircraft who both assumed their responsibilities for arming the emergency exit doors were covered by the other. During predeparture preparations, one flight attendant was focused on cleaning and securing the galley, while the other was assisting with passenger seating and safety checks. Neither ensured the doors were armed, leading to the aircraft taking off with both upper deck doors disarmed. Upon realizing the mistake, they armed the doors, informed the cockpit, and completed the flight safely. The flight attendant later reflected on the need for clearer communication and task allocation to prevent such oversights in the future.",between attendant and crew

After stowing my bags above the flight crew rest seats I proceeded to the cockpit and the Captain handed me the window shades for the cockpit and told me to find a place to store them as he did not have enough room in the closet in the cockpit.  I went to the pilot designated storage areas above the flight crew rest seats and did not find any room to store the shades.  I then attempted to return to the cockpit and found the galley Flight Attendant trying to store her bags in the closet aft of the cockpit.  I was waiting for her to finish so I could return to the cockpit and put the window shades under the second observers seat.  While waiting the galley Flight Attendant looked up and said; 'those won't fit in my closet'; referring to the shades.  I said; 'I don't want to put them in there'.  Still waiting she said; 'You didn't hear me; those won't fit in my closet!'  I said; 'Again; I don't want to put them in YOUR closet.'  She finally was finished and I secured the shades in the cockpit.  The other relief pilot asked what happened because the galley Flight Attendant said; 'I hope he doesn't plan on eating tonight.'  This is a 13+ hour flight and I wanted to try and address the issue with the galley Flight Attendant.  As I went to the galley to speak with her another Flight Attendant said; 'You better not push her buttons; she controls your food!'

On southbound leg; several verbal exchanges of words led the Captain and First Officer 1 and First Officer 2 to conclude that several flight attendants (not all) had little respect for Captain authority. At one point Purser walked away from Captain during a conversation involving safety issues. During layover; Captain made decision to replace Purser with another Flight Attendant. Captain ordered initial Purser to work in coach (or at least not as Purser) but the Purser refused to follow Captain's orders.  Captain and First Officers agreed we could not work with this Flight Attendant and requested that a Flight Operations Manager remove him from flight. Ultimately; the remaining flight attendants wanted to walk if Purser was removed from aircraft. All agreed that they felt the Captain was unsafe if Purser was removed.  Pilot talked to the Flight Operations Manager on a conference call and decided to allow Purser to fly as passenger. Purser agreed to ride as passenger. Flight Attendants never recanted on their reference to the unsafe feature regarding the Captain. Second Purser took over. Northbound flight was uneventful.

This decision was met with resistance from other flight attendants, who expressed concerns about the Captain's safety if the Purser was removed. After a conference call with the Flight Operations Manager, it was agreed that the Purser would fly as a passenger on the remainder of the journey rather than continue in his role. The remaining flight attendants maintained their stance that they could not work safely under the Captain's authority if the Purser was removed.

He once again stated that they don't have Maintenance here. I then asked him 'What if we have a problem in the back of the aircraft.' He replied 'I can hear you so I can click once for yes and twice for no.' I realized later how foolish I was not to have walked off the plane at that time. After takeoff the #2 got out her manual and of course there it was under malfunctions. 'Airline can not dispatch a flight if all cockpit cabin interphones are inoperative.'

The takeoff and climb were all normal.  During our climb one of the Flight Attendants rang us and said the passenger count was 81.  I asked her to verify the count two more times.  She still said the count was 81 not 51. The First Officer adjusted the zero fuel weight by adding 5;800 lbs to the FMC to account for 30 Passenger error.  Upon arrival I called Operations and spoke to a Supervisor.  He asked what revision number was on my loadsheet and I replied Revision zero.  He informed me the loadsheet was revised three times and it was closed out at 81 Passengers.  So the error occurred when the Agent gave us the original loadsheet which was incorrect and the Flight Attendant did not actually perform a passenger count but instead went off the loadsheet. I spoke with the Flight Attendants and informed them how important it is to actually perform the count to crosscheck the Agent's number.,,The 'perfect storm' of two compound errors led to this event. A correct count by the Flight Attendants would have allowed us to catch the error on the loading schedule. Flight Attendants need to understand the importance of an accurate Passenger count; that it is not just a 'nice-to-know' number on a napkin.

I told him I wasn't doing well at all and wouldn't be able to do an inflight service. I was asked if we needed to make an emergency landing. I told him I thought I could at least make it to our destination. After that phone call; I had to go back to the lav. At that point in time I was very weak & dizzy and couldn't make it back up to my jumpseat. So I retreated to the nearest seat. I left my jumpseat out the entire flight to create some sort of barrier between the cabin and the flight deck. A passenger came up to me and told me he was a former EMT & wanted to take my vital signs. He said I wasn't in the best shape but I would be okay. I asked him to call the flight deck and let them know what was going on with me. He then returned and told me we were about 30 minutes out from our destination and we would be landing soon. Once we landed; EMTs boarded the aircraft and assisted me into the terminal via wheelchair. My vital signs were taken and I told them the symptoms of how I was feeling. They told me it sounded like I had food poisoning and there wasn't much they or a hospital could do for me. They advised against going to the hospital. I was contacted by my manager and crew scheduling. I was told I was taken off my trip and my manager had me go to the airport clinic to be evaluated. The doctor at the clinic diagnosed me with food poisoning and told me not to fly anywhere that night or the next morning. He also said there was nothing he could prescribe me and that the illness would have to run its course. The next time I am ill to the point of not being able to perform my duties and I know well ahead of time I will definitely call crew scheduling and my manager and let them know immediately. I will also get to some sort of urgent care facility as quickly as possible. I should have called as soon as I started showing signs of illness. I understand also that it is a major problem with me being the only flight attendant on duty and not being able to be in the proper state of mind and body to effectively perform my duties.,,Flight Attendant got progressively sicker during flight to the point of a passenger needing to help fill in for her duties. I briefed the First Officer on the situation and he had heard some of it. I said we needed to find in the FOM/POM reference to flight attendant incapacitation. I could find no reference in POM index for flight attendant or incapacitation. First Officer eventually found it.I told her if she was not feeling well or felt worse to brief a passenger on the use of the interphone and have them contact the flight deck. ... with approximately 50 minutes left in the flight at FL340 I received an interphone call from the cabin from a passenger on board saying the flight attendant was ill. He identified himself as a pilot and EMT. I asked the status of our Flight Attendant and he said she was conscious with a good pulse and good breathing and aside from being sick to the stomach had good vitals.I briefed the passenger initially on the interphone use and if a chime was heard pick up the phone and if her condition changed to call us ... At some point I went in the back and briefed the EMT that if he believed the flight attendant could not adequate perform her duties to relocate the her to a passenger seat and that he needed to sit in the FA jumpseat per FOM 'Flight Attendant Incapacitation' procedures. He accepted and I briefed him on opening the door stowing the Flight Attendant jumpseat upon arrival at the gate and going over securing the cabin for arrival.,,A CRJ900 flight crew must make difficult decisions when the sole flight attendant aboard is incapacitated by food poisoning.,"A flight attendant on a CRJ900 aircraft became incapacitated due to food poisoning, which manifested with symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, and severe cramps. Despite initial attempts to continue her duties, her condition deteriorated, leading her to inform the captain she could not perform her responsibilities. The captain, referencing company procedures (FOM), coordinated with a passenger who was an EMT to monitor her condition and take appropriate actions. The flight landed safely, with the EMT assisting in securing the cabin and moving the flight attendant to a passenger seat. Upon deplaning, she was evaluated by EMTs and later at an airport clinic, diagnosed with food poisoning, and advised against flying. The incident highlighted the importance of early communication with crew scheduling and seeking timely medical assistance.",between attendant and crew
