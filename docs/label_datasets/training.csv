Ultimately; I failed to notify either Operations in ZZZ or the Captain. Upon reflection during the flight and; as not to create an 'issue;' I realized that I had failed to handle the situation correctly. In an effort to not continue the risk; upon arrival in ZZZ1; I spoke with the Operations Agent and explained the situation and asked if it could be corrected. The Operations Agent indicated to me that the passenger's bags would be pulled prior to their connecting flight. I then spoke to the passenger(s) and asked them to speak with the Operations Agent. Self-realization that each of us is critically responsible for the safety of our crew; our passengers and our assets. That it is not an issue to stop what is currently happening and address it at the time. To hope that if you do make an error that by handling it at the time; that you will not be perceived differently by the crew. Is it possible that checked baggage be screened for items such as lithium batteries; thereby reducing the factor of human error?,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported failing to notify the appropriate parties before departure after learning about a passenger's checked bag that may have potentially contained lithium batteries. After arriving; the reporter notified an Operations Agent to deal with the bag's contents.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who was informed by a passenger that their checked luggage contained an electric razor and a camera, potentially housing lithium batteries. The attendant initially failed to notify Operations or the Captain, possibly due to uncertainty about the items. Upon realizing the oversight, the attendant informed an Operations Agent upon arrival, leading to the passenger's bags being pulled before their connecting flight. The attendant reflected on the importance of safety and suggested enhancing procedures to reduce human error through better screening of checked baggage for lithium batteries.",training

We called back to the FA's (Flight Attendants) who said they were finishing up service and would come up when they could. When they called up; they gave the code word as normal. I did a positive exchange of controls to the Captain since it was my PF (Pilot Flying) leg. He took controls as normal. Door unlocked and the crew swap went normal. Upon finishing in the lavatory the B FA called up to begin the next crew exchange. She informed me that the CA wanted to use the lavatory too. I was waiting in the galley expecting the A FA to come out so we could do the normal process of me sitting down; getting controls back; getting any flight updates; and then having the FA's call back up so the CA could use the lav. Instead; the flight deck door opened and out walked the CA. No one was at the controls; the A FA was in the process of moving from my seat to the CA seat. I immediately said 'she's supposed to come out first; no one is at the controls'. The CA responded 'oh; right' or something along those lines. The B FA and myself expressed our concerns over the incorrect lavatory exchange procedure. He then proceeded to open the lavatory door. Not go back into the flight deck. I rushed into the flight deck; sat down; got myself situated and locked the door since there was no pilot. I got the aviate; navigate done and now wanted to communicate. I asked the A FA what happened and she said 'I don't really know; he told me to switch seats with him so we squeezed past each other'. I told her that's not normal and that I needed to talk to the CA. The B FA called up; said the code word; and the CA came back in. I talked to him about what happened and he said something like 'oh right; that did seem strange'. I talked to him about the correct procedure which he; I assume; did not know. I told him we had no one at the controls and how dangerous that is. Upon getting to the hotel the FA's asked me if I was going to fill out a report. I called the Pilot Union Professional Standards to get their opinion on the situation. I used this as a teaching moment; however; the whole event should never have happened.,,,,First Officer reported that during a lavatory break; both pilots were out of the cockpit at the same time and the flight attendant was swapping seats in the cockpit; leaving the aircraft uncontrolled.,"The incident occurred during a flight when the First Officer (FO) and Captain (CA) were both absent from the cockpit, leaving the aircraft uncontrolled. The First Officer had informed the Captain of the need to use the lavatory, and the flight attendants (FAs) were expected to manage the cockpit exchange. However, during the crew swap, the flight deck door was opened, and the Captain entered the cockpit while no pilot was seated at the controls. Simultaneously, the A FA was in the process of moving from the FO's seat to the Captain's seat, creating a dangerous situation. The FO returned to the cockpit, retook control, and addressed the unsafe procedure with the Captain. The B FA also expressed concerns about the improper exchange.

The aircraft was put on a hardstand with no tug where with guidance from the ramp crew we would be able to start both engines and be directed to the movement area of the ramp. After completing the Engine Start Check; I looked over to the Ramper and with their permission; I released the parking brake. I however; did not reengage the parking brake. I then directed the First Officer to start both engines. The number 2 engine was started first. Following the start of the number 1 engine; the First Officer stepped on the brakes and simultaneously engaged the parking brake. This caused the airplane to stop abruptly. I asked the First Officer why he did what he did; and he said that we were moving. I then said that it was my mistake for not having the parking brake engaged; but we were moving slowly and we were far from any equipment and people. I then asked the First Officer two questions Why did he not say to me that the aircraft was moving and I would have applied the brakes and why did he apply both the brakes and the parking brake at the same time ? He said that he was not sure the brakes alone would have stopped the airplane. We then proceeded with the rest of the normal checklists and taxied to the runway and departed. In flight; the Flight Attendant said she was injured from the whiplash and was bruised. She said she may see a doctor upon reaching our destination. At the end of the flight I exchanged my contact information with the Flight Attendant to keep me informed of her physical condition. The whole sequence of events started with me not engaging the parking brake after releasing it for the out time. The threat of not recognizing that we do not have rampers to tell us to reset the brake after push was not addressed during our threat discussion and mitigation. My error was not seeing the airplane moving after the number one engine started and stopping the airplane before the First Officer. The undesired state was the fact that the aircraft moved when it should not have causing potential harm to the ramp crew and outside equipment. The other error I would say was CRM. The First Officer acted in the interest of safety and was the first to recognize the movement of the aircraft. He however over reacted. Based on the fact the airplane was moving slowly and we were far from rampers and equipment; I think he should have told me that we were moving and I would have stopped the airplane. If I did not react he then should have stepped on the brakes. This was the error on CRM our part. After talking to him I found out that he just finished IOE recently and this was his first trip after completing IOE. I think lack of experience in actual line operations caused him to act the way he did. I also should have checked with the Flight Attendant to see how she was doing after the airplane came to a stop. What I learned was to be extra vigilant when you are taxiing out with no towbar from the gate. If we were close to people or equipment; this could have been bad. Addressing ramp operations with no tug driver telling you to 'set the brake' is a threat that we should have discussed and talked about. I also need to be more aware of aircraft (unintentional) movement in all situations and react appropriately.,,,,ERJ145 Captain reported the parked aircraft began rolling on the ramp and the First Officer put the brakes on and the parking brake causing an abrupt stop injuring a Flight Attendant.,"The incident involved an ERJ145 aircraft during its morning flight. The captain released the parking brake but failed to re-engage it, causing the aircraft to move on the ramp after the engines were started. The first officer, noticing the movement, applied both the brakes and the parking brake, resulting in an abrupt stop. A flight attendant sustained injuries from the sudden stop, including whiplash and bruising. The primary causes of the incident were the captain's oversight in not re-engaging the parking brake after releasing it and the first officer's overreaction to the aircraft's movement. The captain acknowledged a lapse in vigilance during ramp operations without proper communication from ground staff and attributed the first officer's actions to his recent completion of initial operating experience (IOE), indicating a lack of line operation experience. The captain learned the importance of being more vigilant when taxiing without a tug and emphasized the need to address ramp operation threats during pre-flight briefings. Additionally, the incident highlighted the importance of effective crew resource management (CRM) and clear communication to prevent similar occurrences.",training

The flight attendant reflected on the possibility that the passenger may have misheard due to the face mask, speaking too fast, or unclear articulation. The flight attendant acknowledged the need to improve their communication technique in future briefings.",training

I pointed it out to the gate agent and he stated it's approved; because it covers her nose and mouth. But I stated; no; because it's see through and mesh. Masks have to be made of solid material.So thinking the gate agent would say something to her about the mask Passenger X boards the plane and takes her seat wearing her mesh mask. FWD Flight Attendant (FA) sees this and questions it and then calls me for a reference. I stated to her; I don't think it's an approved mask for flying; let me find it in the manual before going to Passenger X. While I'm trying to find it; FWD FA sends a message to the gate agent about Passenger X wearing this mesh mask.  FWD FA also informs the Captain as well. After searching under COVID section; I find it and inform FWD FA and the Captain that it's not approved and that I'll inform her that her mask is not compliant. I approach Passenger X about her mesh mask and also show her in manual that it's not compliant. Passenger X makes a statement that she's been allowed to wear it on her flights. I then read the mask compliance portion in the manual verbatim. She makes a little fuss about it and then states 'Fine; hand me a mask.' I tell her 'Thank you.' I head back up to the FWD part of the cabin; galley area to inform FWD FA and Captain we're good. Passenger X switched out her mask for one of our mask. Also show them both in the manual where it's located if there's ever any other issues that arise in the future. They can both reference. Also state to the gate agent that Passenger X mask is not approved.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger was required to remove a mesh face mask; while the Gate Agent did not agree; and use a company supplied mask before departure.,"The incident involved a disagreement between a flight attendant and a gate agent regarding the approval of a passenger's mesh face mask. The flight attendant believed the mask was not compliant with airline policies due to its see-through material, while the gate agent initially allowed the passenger to wear it as it covered the nose and mouth. During the flight, the flight attendant questioned the mask's approval, consulted the manual, and informed the captain. The flight attendant then approached the passenger, showed the manual's mask compliance section, and explained the mask was not approved. The passenger initially protested but eventually agreed to exchange the mesh mask for a company-provided one. The flight attendant informed the gate agent and captain that the issue was resolved, providing future reference in the manual if similar situations arise.",training

He further alleged that I knew about this prior to takeoff. I responded that I was not aware of any such issue; and would not have departed had I known. He said he had cell phone video and observed the aft FA (Flight Attendant) make a interphone call to the cockpit. Noting this was a serious safety issue. I concurred with him that if this occurred it was indeed a safety issue and that I would investigate and report as required; but I had not received an interphone call from the FA. He reiterated the cell phone video and stated his intent to submit it to [the company] and the FAA. He provided no further details; nor showed me the video; and departed. As background; the flight was operating about 5 hours late due to aircraft non-availability. Once we had an aircraft; we boarded and waited another 25 mins or so for a replacement FO (First Officer) as the original FO was now projected illegal. The new FO was a [distantly-based] new hire; but this had little if any impact on the flight. On taxi out we stopped for about 20 minutes in the west hard stand to receive a complete weather reroute from ATC; reentered the new route; got approval from dispatch to operate on the new route; changed runways and departures; briefed and accomplished flows and checklist. We had 4 minutes to make our [Departure Time]. I immediately made the 'FA prepare for Takeoff PA'; cleared to line up and wait by ATC; cycled the seat belt chime to alert FAs we were taking the runway; sat for 15-20 seconds and were cleared for takeoff. Uneventful flight to ZZZ till passenger approached me (FO was already gone) at gate in ZZZ. All of this delay information just indicates that passengers; especially a small child; might well have needed to use the lavatory. So I did query the Flt Attendants about this incident. The aft FA did make an interphone call to the #1 FA; following his chain of command; to advise that a father had taken his son into the restroom. The #1 FA told me he did not contact us on the Flt Deck because we had 'already started rolling for takeoff' and he was concerned about violating the sterile cockpit in a critical phase of flight. He made a quick decision that overall safety was better served by not contacting us. Clearly taking off with anyone in the lavatory is unsafe and against [company] SOPs. Unclear to me in this event is exactly when the father and child entered the lavatory. If during the hold short or line up and wait (15-20 secs) phase; a call could be appropriate to the cockpit to alert us of the situation. We could decline the takeoff clearance and clear the runway as needed. If in fact we were accelerating (rolling?) for takeoff; the passengers' safety may be more compromised by the rapid deceleration of a rejected takeoff. The FA's situational awareness is limited to our departure PA; and taking the runway chime followed by aircraft movement and engine noise. This limited input could affect their decision making process as to where we are in the takeoff maneuver.Secondly; I'm concerned about communication. I brief the #1 FA on every flight; I believe this to be important since we now fly with many different crews; from many different bases; frequently different on every leg. I did so on this flight to relay details of the flight and to open up communication. Still no one called to advise us of this event during the entire flight. I only learned about it from the concerned passenger at the arrival gate. Kind of blindsided. Not even the father in the lavatory said anything. Of note there were 10 uniformed crew members on the flight who said nothing when departing; though they may not have been in a position to observe anything. Bottom line is passenger safety is paramount; I believeunless we're on high speed takeoff roll; we could have handled a reject safely if notified. Perhaps a more assertive approach by the FA would have prevented this event from progressing to a takeoff with passengers not in their seats.,,,,A321 Captain reported being informed after landing of passenger using lavatory during previous takeoff roll.,"A passenger reported to the flight captain that a father and small boy were in the lavatory during takeoff. The passenger provided a cell phone video showing an interphone call made by a flight attendant to another crew member, who then did not contact the cockpit to avoid violating sterile cockpit rules during a critical phase. The flight experienced multiple delays, including aircraft unavailability and weather reroutes, leading to a near-miss of the departure time. The flight attendant involved made an interphone call but did not inform the cockpit, leaving the captain unaware of the situation until post-landing. The captain expressed safety concerns, emphasizing the importance of timely communication during takeoffs to allow for safe aborted takeoffs if necessary. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication protocols, especially with diverse crews, to prevent similar occurrences and ensure passenger safety.",training

Saturdays are busier than normal but no effort to adjust that today.  Then management assigns domestic on what they thought was an open desk [XX] but that desk was open and they make that domestic dispatcher who showed at XA00 to move off the desk they assigned in error to desk [XX] one and half hours after being here; in that time of moving desk to desk [YY] they received several calls (please note that releases have that desk number on it) so the one remaining international desk [ZZ] has to now answer and transfer the calls to correct desk; while working their new workload which is in beginning of shift and they are also working to remain in control of desk. The Domestic Dispatcher is now rushing to move and reset up and transfer flights between desks; and of course there are several calls and now all desks in international which where reduced by two are forced to help the lone domestic dispatcher with these issues; in addition.  Now that this Dispatcher moved all but one flight was moved that was caught by incoming Dispatcher and moved to the original desk that had it on the domestic side since new Dispatcher was also on a call and still trying to set up their new desk.  The phones kept ringing on wrong desk and the lone Domestic Dispatcher asked for help not knowing that two of the International Dispatchers where already on phone with the Domestic Dispatchers other issues.  I asked the International Dispatcher next to me to get the Chief to lend assistance but they where in the bridge morning meeting discussing the weather and daily assignments.  The International Dispatcher came back to report that Chief was unavailable; and I suggested that the Chief needs to leave that meeting and help domestic dispatcher for they are swamped and bringing down the entire Caribbean team; so the other dispatcher went to Chief and insisted on getting help for domestic dispatch and fortunately there was a Chief in training who came down to answer phones and lend a hand.  The phone calls I took where Flight ABCD time off gate was generated in error and needed to be removed; Flight DAEE was in ZZZ going to ZZZ1 and they where given a ground delay and ATC re-route so then I had to get reroute ensure compliance build that route and verify that we had petrol to accomplish this: I got so in detailed with this issues I did not get time out and I had to ask International Dispatcher to remove that time.  While working on weather briefing and re-route another of the Domestic lines where ringing and all International Dispatchers where on phone so I grabbed the call and placed them on hold to finish re-route but that person hung up and then called.  I advised the captain of Flight DAEE that I would finish re-route after I briefed on weather and send them an ACARS with route and burns; since the Domestic Dispatcher was at this point under water and not coming up.  The Captain said that would be fine and I built his new route while I answered another one of the Domestic Dispatchers phone lines.  This was a flight attendant who once I answered she said they had a medical emergency and needed Medlink!  I asked for flight number while I was still engaged in the re-route for the Domestic Dispatch (placing all my international desk and its duties on lower priority).  The Flight Attendant (FA) was not using proper radio telephone procedure; nor had any patience; to connect to Medlink we need basic info flight number; age; gender; problem or issue but the FA when placed on hold thought they where disconnected and called back but to further aspirate the issue they called the original desk domestic side of room and needed to be transferred to international side of room.  So this one flight and one flight attendant had to be spoken to sternly just to remain on line with Medlink.  Now once Medlink got on lineagain the FA did not provide information had to be extracted by Medlink and that conversation was very difficult because the FA world speak pause and speak not allowing Medlink to speak or speaking over Medlink with the constant live mic one of the mics stuck open and there was a constant hiss in back ground and flight attendant kept telling doctor to speak louder and the doctor was practically yelling; finally the FA said that they could not hear so I ACARS crew to have PIC call in and speak to Medlink; since the doctor on board was saying they needed to land now; the Domestic Dispatcher got that call and remained on line with the Medlink and did divert the flight but this poor planning of management and multiple error caused problems for a international section that was already task saturated due to managements closing of several desk and distributing that international workload.Several failures:  First Management not understanding that it is not the number of flights but the quality of work and the management team has closed desk that was originally planned open based on published schedule.  Second; Management not familiar with work on quad and placed a Domestic Dispatcher on a weekend International desk; third; the decision to move was not well thought or executed and if it was not for another dispatcher an airborne flight would have been left unattended; Forth; placing a domestic dispatcher in an area by themselves with no support of other domestic dispatchers working similar area and familiar with weather; GDP; and ATC initiatives; fifth; only having one chief who was also task saturated; sixth; not having properly training flight attendants on proper radio telephone etiquette and protocol. Stop closing desk; and Staff properly (follow workload committee models numbers and not a number that is not truly representative of the actual work.  Have sector managers that come from ranks of dispatch and fully understand issues on floor or at least have them trained by dispatch instructors who have worked the floor.  Place like dispatchers together i.e. domestic working NE or ZZZ1 or SE together so highest quality of information is properly disseminated to flight crews without taking extra time and further task saturating the other dispatchers and areas.  Have an International Chief and Domestic Chief (or at least two Chiefs; who are current and qualified to better aid floor dispatchers).  Properly train all flight attendants for proper radio telephone etiquette and protocol.,,,,Dispatcher reported staffing issues resulting in being inundated with various tasks and moving from the desk to desk in order try to maintain operational control and communications with their flights.,"The incident arose from a combination of poor management decisions and miscommunication within the dispatch team, leading to a highly task-saturated workload and operational breakdown. The root cause included the reduction of international desks without adjusting the workload, assigning a domestic dispatcher to an international desk during peak hours, and insufficient staffing planning. These decisions overwhelmed the remaining dispatchers, who were forced to handle an influx of calls and re-routing of flights while managing their own workload. Additionally, a flight attendant's lack of proper radio telephone protocol compounded the issue during a medical emergency, requiring the intervention of a Chief in training to assist the overwhelmed domestic dispatcher. The result was a near-disruption of operations, with the flight being diverted due to the poor planning and lack of support. The dispatcher highlighted several systemic failures, including inadequate staffing models, lack of trained leadership, and insufficient training for flight attendants. Proposed solutions included restoring proper staffing levels, having dedicated international and domestic chiefs, and improving training for both dispatchers and flight attendants to prevent similar incidents.",training

However, due to a hectic pre-takeoff taxi process, where passengers repeatedly needed to be reminded to sit down and fasten their seatbelts, the information was inadvertently forgotten. The lead FA proposed a potential solution: implementing a system in the computer to denote FFDOs with a triangle symbol, which could help ensure the information was readily accessible during busy boarding or pre-takeoff procedures.

The passenger was informed to take a seat at mid to aft cabin due to distribution on the 800 aircraft; stating there is plenty of overhead bin space at the back for his carry on that seemed a bit large for the more narrow/less deep bins up front. The passenger snapped at the D Flight Attendant indicating that he was going to do what he wanted to do.Flight Attendant D recognized that the tall male passenger sat in the OWWE (Overwing Window Exit) Row. As the D made her way back she stopped to see how the passenger was doing. He was glossy eyed and loud. Flight Attendant D inquired if he had been smoking and under the influence of a substance. The passenger replied 'Yes; all day long.'  Flight Attendant D clarified if he were referring to Marijuana? The passenger replied 'Yes; I voted for it and I have been smoking all day long. We just signed a deal...' Then showing his logo/ clothing brand.The D Flight Attendant congratulated him on his business dealt then proceeded to inform the B Flight Attendant of the concern having a person under the influence of a substance in the OWWE. The B Flight Attendant concurred stating that 'Under the influence of a drug/marijuana is the same as alcohol.'The D Flight Attendant informed the A Flight Attendant of the concern then went up to the forward galley to discuss with the A [Flight Attendant]. The C Flight Attendant conducted the OWWE brief.The A [Flight Attendant] proceeded to talk to the passenger. The D Flight Attendant informed the flight deck both Captain and First Officer. No verbal response was given to the D Flight Attendant from the flight deck.The A Flight Attendant informed me; the D Flight Attendant that the man was okay.The D; said 'No he's not - he is admittedly in front of many passengers; I can smell the marijuana; under a controlled substance; approved use in Captain is only for use in the home and at a minimum he should not be in the OWWE; if even on this plane however even people who smell as if they've been drinking are not to be allowed to board.' The A Flight Attendant responded by saying; 'I spoke to him and leaned in and could not smell it.'Later the B Flight Attendant stated that he appears under the influence of marijuana/a substance and is eating a lot of pretzels; referring to the munchies.Later the C Flight Attendant stated that he (C) 'Heard how the passenger was talking to the D Flight Attendant and told him to settle down.' As the D Flight Attendant - the C heard that the passenger said he had been smoking marijuana all day long why was he allowed to remain in the overwing window exit?I think the FAM (Flight Attendant Manual) needs to clarify the term 'Intoxicated' to define if it only refers to alcohol or any substance to include marijuana; meth; speed; cocaine. Particular clarification is suggested with respect to marijuana as it is now legal in many states. However I don't think those laws supersede federal law or Federal Aviation Regulations. I think that the flight deck/ops made an error in allowing the passenger to remain in the OWWE; even if they wanted to approve a stoned/person under marijuana passenger to be able to remain on the plane. I think the fatal error was made in saying 'The A said the passenger was okay. 'If the A Flight Attendant has the final say then please clarify for crew.  The C and B Flight Attendants are still on probation and the A has not been flying too long. Being able to answer a question 'Yes; I will help' is not very reassuring when someone is under the influence of a primarily illegal substance even if it is legal in some states. It is a known fact that reaction time and mental processing of information is delayed under the influence of marijuana and other drugs; legal or illegal.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that a person under the influence of marijuana was allowed to remain seated in the emergency aisle after admitting being under the influence.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who encountered a passenger emitting the odor of marijuana.

They debated whether he should be removed from the overwing window exit seat due to safety concerns. The flight deck was informed but did not provide a verbal response. The A Flight Attendant deemed the passenger acceptable, while others, including the B and C Flight Attendants, disagreed, noting the passenger's behavior and the potential risks of marijuana use. The situation highlighted the need for clarification in the Flight Attendant Manual regarding the definition of ""intoxicated"" to include substances like marijuana, despite its legal status in some states.

He never communicated with us that he had confirmed the type of battery inside the device and he verified that it was safe for travel in the cargo hold of the aircraft. If he had indeed safely verified he had checked the device thoroughly; he should have been able to answer the question about the type of battery powering the device and communicated that information with both the flight deck crew and the Flight Attendants.

She sent us Version 2 of the Takeoff Data with the updated count; we re-accomplished the Before Push Checklist; and the flight proceeded normally.GENERAL SAFETY CONCERN: This isn't the first time I've had this situation occur. It's easiest to catch on full or nearly full flights with a senior 'C' F/A who still counts the number of empty seats before pushback. Various things can set up the situation where this error can occur; a boarding pass that isn't scanned will do it; or an [Gate] Agent who assumes that the thru count is correct without verifying can cause it as well. I've seen that too; the deplaning F/A's got a thru-count; but the [Gate] Agent never asked for it; and the oncoming F/A's were never asked or told what it was. The [Gate] Agent blindly assumed that the count was right; and she was wrong. (That error got caught because it occurred before the final passenger count was abolished.) With current procedures; if the thru-count is off and the subsequent flight isn't full; NOTHING will catch this sort of error after it gets made. 'What's the thru-count supposed to be? 28. Yeah; we have 28.' (No; you have 29; because the 4th Rider; in a seat; is staying on even though the operational information system thinks she's getting off here; but you didn't catch it because another passenger was using the lav when you counted and you weren't aware of it. Or because you got distracted during the count; and it was like 27 or 28 or something; and it's easier to say 'yeah; we have 28' than to go back and count again.) These errors happen ALL THE TIME; but now we are generally oblivious to them; whereas before the procedure change; 'count's off; have to count again' was common. Sometimes the F/A's count before push was simply off and the recount straightened everything out; but other times there was a real discrepancy between the number of people that the computer had on the aircraft; and the true number. The ramifications of errors like this are two-fold. First; the aircraft is operated with an inaccurate ZFW (Zero Fuel Weight) and Takeoff Gross Weight. This means that the aircraft is operated in a non-compliant manner with certainty; even though the actual impact of a 200 or even 400 pound error is essentially nil. Second; however; in the event of an aircraft accident; having an accurate count of Souls On Board can be absolutely vital; and an inaccurate count may be the difference between leaving someone on the aircraft who could be rescued; or sending a firefighter into an aircraft in search of an individual who was never there in the first place. In other words; an accurate count makes no difference whatsoever; until that one day when it is of life and death importance. It frankly astounds me that; at the same time that we obsess over 97 bags versus 98 bags (at 50 pounds each); with elaborate checks and verification between the ramp agents and the [Gate] Agent; we willingly forgo the best and only verification of what the computer says about our number of passengers (at 200 pounds each). How the FAA can require no counting of people actually onboard the aircraft at the same time they require exact accountability of bags; is beyond me. An extra passenger; as we had today; is four times as consequential in terms of aircraft weight as an extra bag; and infinitely more important as a soul to be rescued and accounted for in the event of an accident.The FAA should require Company to return to the previous practice of counting the actual number of people who are physically onboard the aircraft prior to pushing back from the gate. Yes; those counts take time; and when a Flight Attendant miscounts; it takes time to resolve the error. But; isn't an accurate count of the number of lives in our care worth it?,,,,B737 Captain reported an inaccurate passenger count prior to departure.,"An incident occurred involving a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding an inaccurate passenger count prior to departure. The flight captain noticed a discrepancy in the ""Souls On Board"" count, initially reporting 144 souls (138 passengers, 1 infant, and 5 crew) based on the Weight and Balance report. The flight attendant, however, stated there were 139 passengers plus an infant. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the infant was in a lap, not a seat. The flight crew consulted with the gate agent and verified the counts. A boarding pass had not been scanned, leading to the error. The gate agent confirmed the count and provided an updated Takeoff Data version, prompting a recalculation of the Before Push Checklist. The flight proceeded normally after the resolution. The flight captain highlighted that such discrepancies often occur due to unverified boarding passes or gate agents assuming counts are accurate without confirmation. They emphasized the critical importance of accurate passenger counts for aircraft weight calculations and emergency response, proposing that the FAA require a return to physically counting passengers before departure, despite the time it may take. This practice, the captain argued, ensures the safety and accurate accounting of lives on board.",training

He immediately responded that he was a frequent flyer and didn't have to. I asked him politely stating that it was FAR procedure that bags that size be checked (it was over 21 inches in height and rather wide). He got belligerent and said he would be talking to the airline about the poor treatment. I apologized; stating that I was following procedure. He checked his bag and immediately came back saying he was being abused and that I had been yelling at him. At this point; I asked my Captain to see if there was anything he could do to alleviate his mood. My Captain politely talked to him; and the passenger sat down.Once everyone was on board and I got my final; I immediately did my announcements; count; and shut the door. When I did service; I asked him what he wanted and had him repeat it so I was certain I got it right. I then offered him his complimentary drink or snack because he was entitled to it. He got the [snack] box. I finished service; did a trash run; and as I am eating; he ripped back my galley curtain and demanded that I talk to the guy behind him who was rudely kicking his seat to not; because he should be allowed to keep his seat back. I nodded; and asked the guy behind him in [4C] to refrain from kicking him. It was painfully obvious that he wasn't doing it on purpose. The passenger in question was 6'5 and well over 350 pounds. He was just too big for the seat and was pressing against it; because his legs had nowhere else to go. I offered the passenger in 4C a different seat away from him and the passenger declined calling Passenger X an entitled baby and that he wasn't interested in moving for him. I did not respond in any way to the name calling; as I did not want to further gain Passenger X's ire; but I was very polite to both of them. About 25 minutes to landing; Passenger X asked for coffee. I told him we ran out; but offered to make him some. He declined.Other passengers remarked about his rude behavior and apologized to me. I didn't respond because it is unprofessional to do so. One woman told me I had the patience of a saint. Upon departing; he told the Gate Agent that I was drunk and rude. The Gate Agent talked to me and I explained that he was upset with me. She remarked that I definitely didn't seem drunk; just very happy go lucky.I boarded for the next [flight]. After shutting the doors; I started to do my safety announcements. I get a call from my Captain and notice the police are waiting. He had called the police and told them I was intoxicated. I don't drink. I haven't had alcohol in over 20 years. I explain this to the police and give them a statement and all my identification and information. I tell them I will fully cooperate with them and I am willing to give blood; pee in a cup; and take a drug or breathalyzer test. The police tell me I definitely do not appear to be drunk or on anything; but they must do a breathalyzer on me to document it. I absolutely complied immediately. I am given a breathalyzer and it comes out 00. The police apologized and I immediately go back to work.I will say that I am absolutely distraught that I was put in this situation. I am a very energetic and enthusiastic individual when it comes to doing my announcements. I am disheartened that my manners were misconstrued in anyway as I try to be as completely professional and polite to everyone I meet. I usually have a great time with my passengers and they always come out of my plane with a big smile on their face. I regret that I was unable to please this passenger at all; but I did everything within guidelines of behavior and professionalism. I really don't know what I could have done differently; except try to accept a bag that was too big for the bin.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger became rude and disruptive after having to check in his carry on bag that was too big for the overhead bin.,"The incident involved a flight attendant and a passenger on a flight. The passenger, identified as Passenger X, became disruptive after being asked to check his large carry-on bag, exceeding the overhead bin's size restrictions. The flight attendant followed proper procedures, but Passenger X responded with belligerence, complaining of poor treatment and later accusing the attendant of yelling at him. Despite apologies and attempts to manage the situation, including involving the captain, the passenger's behavior persisted. During the flight, he made further disruptive demands, including regarding another passenger's seat behavior. Upon disembarking, Passenger X falsely accused the flight attendant of being intoxicated. The captain reported this to the authorities, leading to a police investigation. The flight attendant complied with all requested tests, including a breathalyzer, which confirmed no impairment. The investigation concluded with no evidence of intoxication, allowing the attendant to return to work. The attendant expressed regret over the passenger's misinterpretation of her professionalism and energy, emphasizing adherence to protocol.",training

FA (Flight Attendant) X was not in compliance the first day of work. [She] was eating out of first class basket before anyone was served; not briefing the exit row before main cabin door was closed and texting once she finished her service. The second day; FA X was working first class. When we arrived in ZZZ with almost a four hours and a half sit; I arrived in the crew lounge and was watching TV. FA X came in shortly after me [while] I was watching TV and texting. I look up and FA X pulls the plug from the TV and I said to FA X why are you behaving like this?FA X said you are not watching TV and I said I was and did not appreciate her behavior and she said she would do again if I turn the TV back on and she did for a second time. This time ripped it out of the wall and I said to FA X you are being disrespectful and to not do that again. She left the room; came back at the same time another crew member came in the room. She had her phone so loud. FA Y said would you please turn your phone down. She said that the volume was on the lowest setting for her phone. FA Y offered FA X headphones. She said they would not work on her phone. The show FA X was watching was using profanity every other word and it was very loud. Any crew member who walked in immediately walked out and sat outside the crew room. FA Y and myself left the room. We both felt very uncomfortable with FA X's behavior. The crew room is supposed to be a place to rest and relax. I did not feel comfortable with FA X's behavior [and] called my manager and explained what had happened and to see if once we arrived [at our destination;] if another FA could take her place. The manager said I know you have high expectations and informed me this was a CRM [issue] and we needed to work things out. Requested at some point to send an email in regards to what happened. When we arrived in ZZZ1; it was late and I was very tired and had an early report the next day. Did not have time to do a report in regards to the CRM. Following our ZZZ sit; I arrived to the aircraft for our next trip to ZZZ1; FA X said we needed to make it through these next 2 days. She was not sure what came over her in the crew room. I agreed with FA X let's work together. We performed our safety demo and part of the demo was to wear the life vest and performed how to wear the vest. FA X would only hold the vest during our demo. After our demo; I mentioned she needs to wear it versus holding it. On the third day of our first leg; FA X was leaving bins half open and the closet door open. This happened more than 8 times and had requested to please make sure they are closed and locked. She would just look at me and walked away. The service cart was left unattended at the exit row. FA X left her service cart and walk to the front galley and called the flight deck. I saw the cart sitting in the aisle at row 12. We did have turbulence on and off during the flight. I walk back to the cart and checked with passengers for service. She was requesting [that] a passenger wanted to purchase Pringles. Prior to FA X making the call to the flight deck; FA X had touched the FA call button twice in a row and I held my index finger to say give me a minute with okay I will be there. I was in the middle of my service with first class.I was not comfortable and felt the safety on the aircraft for the passengers and myself was not safe and FA X would not comply with the safety of the aircraft. I had requested for a manager to meet the aircraft once we arrived at our destination due to the situation through ACARS.I was not sure what the reason was for her calling the flight deck. I spoke to the flight deck in regards to problems of safety in flight. FA X called the flight deck and said I was ignoring her and not helping her on requested items. I explained as before; I was serving first class and [I] would be there shortly. I said to the CA (Captain) [that]there was a communication problem and FA X was leaving bins opened and unlocked service cart left in the aisle at row 12. FA X walked up to [the] galley to call the flight deck and left the cart in the aisle. I requested the flight deck to please notify ACARS there was an issue with safety on board and FA X was not keeping the bins closed and locked; left her cart at the exit row and not talking to me. After FA X's service in the main cabin; she began texting on her phone for the remainder of the flight and would not respond to me.On arrival; two regional managers came to the aircraft to talk and discuss the issues. I had explained to FA X; once all passengers had left the aircraft; a manager would be coming to talk with us in regards to our flight. Before I could address the reason for the call; FA X started the conversation in regards to the incident in ZZZ crew room and made false accusations in regards to what happened to the point of making up things that did not occur. The main reason for the meeting was to discuss the safety issues. I explained the issues of FA X not listening to my request to please lock and close all bins and several occasions to please close the closet door after she opened it to remove an item. The manager asked if we both could work this flight together if not; and you choose not to; you will have a missed trip and a meeting with a manager. FA X said she was okay and I said I had a problem flying with FA X from inflight safety as well making false accusations that did not occur.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that the work environment was very stressful due to the cabin crew pairing.,"The incident involved two flight attendants, FA X and FA Y, on a flight operated by an air carrier. FA Y reported that the work environment became increasingly stressful due to FA X's non-compliant and disrespectful behavior. On the first day, FA X violated protocols by eating from the first-class basket before service, failing to brief the exit row, and texting after completing her duties. The following day, during a layover, FA X disrupted the crew lounge by unplugging the TV, leading to a confrontation. FA X's behavior in the crew room was deemed disrespectful and uncomfortable by other crew members, prompting FA Y to contact management and request a replacement. Despite management's suggestion to resolve the CRM issues, FA Y did not file a report due to fatigue. Subsequent days saw continued non-compliance from FA X, including failing to secure bins, leaving the service cart unattended, and making disruptive calls to the flight deck. During turbulence, FA X was observed texting and ignoring safety protocols, leading FA Y to inform the flight deck about safety concerns. Upon arrival, managers met with the crew, where FA X made false accusations. The managers facilitated a discussion, with both agreeing to continue working together, though FA Y expressed ongoing concerns about safety and false allegations. In summary, the incident stemmed from FA X's repeated non-compliance and disrespectful behavior, leading to a CRM breakdown. Management介入 aimed to address the issues, but FA Y's concerns about safety and accuracy highlighted the need for continued attention.",training

The signal for the cabin to disarm doors is the seatbelt sign going off. We waited about 45 seconds and they still hadn't started disarming doors. I cycled the seatbelt sign in case they hadn't heard it; still no disarming. As the jet way was quickly approaching the door we made a PA for the flight attendants to disarm doors. This is the same crew who didn't check handset the night before until we had done a [return to the gate] for another reason. The same 'A' that had no idea what a security check was or why we did it on first flight of day. Same flight attendant that had no idea why we wear O2 masks when one of us leaves the flight deck.Maybe we should train the new hires in more than 2 weeks so they learn what we used to teach all flight attendants in their class. This in just one example of the many things I see on a daily basis that hardly ever happened a few years ago The training of the new hire flight attendants is only hitting high spots now train them the way we used to so they actually learn something.,,,,An Airbus A320 Captain reported that after arrival the flight attendants did not disarm the doors in a timely manner.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding the delayed disarm of cabin doors after arrival. The flight attendant failed to disarm the doors promptly after the seatbelt sign was turned off, despite a 45-second wait and an attempt by the captain to cycle the seatbelt sign. When no action was taken, the captain made a passenger address (PA) announcement to urge the flight attendant to disarm the doors. This incident highlighted concerns about the flight attendant's knowledge and training, as they reportedly lacked understanding of basic procedures such as security checks and oxygen mask usage. The flight attendant in question was part of a new hire group that the captain criticized for inadequate training, suggesting that the training program may need to be revised to include more comprehensive instruction. The summary concludes with a call for improved training for new hires to address recurring issues.",training

Whatever training or emphasis Inflight puts on this training isn't working. More times than not the flight deck has to interject themselves into the process to make it work. On this flight three of the four Flight Attendants didn't think a call was necessary. The fourth F/A insisted. She ran the call. It was bad from the start. She didn't inform the A F/A that a medical call was being made. Didn't know where the jacks were; communications were atrocious. At one point when we finally were able to get her to understand she needed to talk to the Dr.; she keyed the MIC and talked for two minutes straight telling the story of the event. It only stopped when the flight deck keyed up the MIC and interrupted her and told her to stop talking. She seemed unable to grasp the difference from information the Dr. would need and completely irrelevant information. This was a non-emergency event by all accounts. The passenger was awake; alert; and said he felt fine after a juice and snack. If it had been critical this could have ended much differently. As it was; I instructed another F/A to take over towards the end. Anecdotally the F/As are not adequately trained to use the headset. They aren't adequately trained to understand the basics of radio communication. They don't talk loud enough. They don't understand the basic information the Dr. will want. They overstate the qualifications of Medical Personnel who are helping. In our case we had a ski resort medic. She repeatedly referred to him as 'Dr'. We are going to hurt someone. This was the worst medical call that I have ever witnessed. It was an embarrassment; and if it had been an actual crisis; a lot of time was wasted. We have to do better.,,,,B737-800 Captain reported the flight attendants did not seem to be adequately trained to properly utilize ground medical resources.,"The incident involved a flight attendant initiating a ground medical call that was poorly executed due to inadequate training. The attendant failed to communicate effectively, providing unnecessary details and incorrectly referring to a medical responder as a doctor. The situation was non-emergency, with the passenger recovering quickly, but highlighted significant training gaps. The result was a ineffective communication that wasted time and could have been critical in an emergency. The solution proposed is enhanced training for flight attendants in medical communication and procedures.",training

As I was contemplating asking if he needed to use his concentrator during all phases of the flight; I checked my manifest and noticed he wasn't even listed as having an O2 concentrator. As I was about to ask him a question or two; the passenger in 13B asked me if his (12B) O2 bottle ran out; would we have O2 bottles for him to use on board. I almost chuckled as I said 'he's not using O2 from a bottle; it's an O2 concentrator; but we have no info about it even being on board.' She replied that he indeed was using an O2 bottle as he has lung cancer and only 25% use of one of his lungs. I must have had a very odd look on my face as I said 'but he can't bring his own O2 bottle on board an aircraft; totally not allowed!' 'How did you get past the TSA?' She said they discovered the bottle; took it; checked it out; and returned it saying it was okay. My comment was 'they what?' 'So; no one else was informed that you had this and intended to use it on the plane? Turn it off please; now.' I went and retrieved one of our Portable Oxygen Bottles (POBs) and asked the D flight attendant to tell the A flight attendant to notify the flight deck. The passenger in 13B was the girlfriend of the passenger in 12B. She also told me he has used his own POB on many other flights before. She didn't say which airline.Being the C flight attendant; I'm not allowed to be forward of the exit rows for boarding; nor would I leave my cabin area of responsibility prior to takeoff. After takeoff; I'm setting up my cart as the B and D flight attendants are [completing other service duties]. So; not sure how I could have done anything different due to my position. Had I been working a position where I would have seen Mr. [12 B] on what I would have assumed was an O2 concentrator; I would have looked at my manifest to see if he was listed as using one. I would have then asked him if he needed to use it during all phases of flight including takeoff and landing; where I may have asked to move him to a window seat so as not to block/hamper other passengers egress to the main aisle in an emergency. That exchange most likely would have brought about a discovery of an O2 bottle and not a concentrator.I think lesson #1 is never assume a darn thing! Many passengers are not aware they need to disclose plans to use an O2 concentrator and I have watched them come onboard only to discover they aren't listed on my manifest. I then have time to contact an agent to see if they are aware of it and it just hasn't showed up on my manifest yet. I strongly suggest all flight attendants be very aware of passengers using O2 and watch for the device when passengers are boarding; then verify we all know about it. None of that would have mattered in this instance as his O2 bottle was concealed in a small black oblong bag. Boarding an aircraft is a crazy busy time for all concerned. All the more reason to be alert then; as well as any time after takeoff; to things like a passengers using (what should only be) an O2 concentrator and checking to make sure they are listed in our manifest or the proper tag has been placed on it by our agents.,,,,Flight Attendant reported discovering a lung cancer patient inhaling oxygen from a personal bottle not listed on the manifest. The bottle was turned off and replaced with an onboard bottle.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a passenger in seat 12B, diagnosed with lung cancer, used a personal oxygen bottle not listed on the manifest. The flight attendant, initially unaware, was informed by the passenger's girlfriend that TSA had permitted the bottle. Upon realizing the bottle's presence, the flight attendant retrieved an onboard portable oxygen bottle, instructed the passenger to turn off his personal device, and notified the cockpit. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of verifying oxygen device usage and being vigilant during boarding to prevent similar occurrences. The result was the passenger switching to the provided onboard bottle.",training

No inop or deactivated label was present by this CB and no documentation in the logbook could be found regarding this CB so Maintenance was notified. After Maintenance researched the aircraft's history no reason could be found for the CB to be open so the Mechanic closed the CB and signed off the corresponding logbook entry I had written. It is unknown how long this aircraft had been operating with this CB collared.Second; I was informed by the Purser that the aft galley had no electrical power so the utility bus switches were cycled to reset the system and I called a flight attendant in the aft galley to confirm if the galley had power. I was told the power was on and no mention was made of any open CB. I informed the Purser the aft galley power was on. Much later and just prior to departure I was informed that that the forward galley had no electrical power (in spite of the fact the First Officer had requested a cup of coffee some fifteen minutes earlier prior to departing on this all night flight). My experience and intuition dictated an inspection of the forward galley where I immediately discovered two forward galley CBs open. Again Maintenance was notified. The Mechanic informed me that earlier he had opened both the forward and aft galley CBs for reasons I do not fully understand but not related to any aircraft airworthiness or mechanical issue. The Mechanic reset the forward galley CBs and normal galley power was restored.Third; I then needed to confirm the aft galley was powered and if any crew member had reset the aft galley CBs. Power was normal and when asked directly about open CBs a flight attendant admitted that a flight attendant had reset the CBs. I asked him to come forward and we stepped onto the jet bridged where I discretely counseled him that he must never reset a CB and always inform the Captain of any CB that might be found open. The flight soon departed and upon arrival at our destination; as the crew deplaned; I asked three of the flight attendants what they believed should be done if they find a CB open. Their confident consensus was that they could reset the CB one time while on the ground and that notifying the Captain was not required. I informed them of the correct policy but they persisted that their rules allowed them to reset a CB. I further explained the policy was for safety reasons and that I was not authorized to ever reset a CB. I encouraged them to research the issue.It appears many flight attendants may not understand our CB policy and their responsibility to inform the Captain of aircraft discrepancies. Specifically; I recommend an immediate system wide electronic message to all flight attendants reminding them of the CB policy and their responsibility to inform the Captain of all maintenance related issues. Additional periodic training also seems to be required for all flight attendants. Note: On other flights; I have had flight attendants bypass me WHEN I'M PRESENT to inform Maintenance of an issue and only later do I happen to learn of the problem; and have been told by flight attendants pre-departure that: 'you can write it up when we get to our destination' as if they have that authority. Initiative by flight attendants to notify appropriate agencies for support should not be discouraged when the flight crew is not present but they should be reminded that they still have the responsibility to insure the Captain is informed.,,,,A B757-200 Captain utilized the occasion of finding an open and banded Circuit Breaker (CB) during preflight to address what he believes to be diametrically opposed understanding of undirected CB operation between flight crew and cabin staff. He further addressed what he believes to inappropriate direct flight attendant/maintenance interface without prior consultation with the Captain.,"During the pre-flight preparation for a B757-200 flight, the Captain discovered an open Circuit Breaker (CB) with a red collar in the potable water system. No documentation or labels indicated a known issue with the CB, so Maintenance was notified. After researching the aircraft's history, Maintenance found no explanation for the CB being open and closed it, signing off in the logbook. Later, the Captain addressed issues with galley power and discovered two forward galley CBs open. Maintenance explained they had opened and closed the forward and aft galley CBs earlier for unclear reasons, unrelated to airworthiness or mechanical issues. The Captain was concerned about the lack of communication regarding these actions. Upon further investigation, the Captain learned that a flight attendant had reset the aft galley CB without informing the Captain. The Captain discreetly counseled the flight attendant on the proper procedure to report any CB issues. After the flight, the Captain questioned other flight attendants about their understanding of CB policies. Their responses indicated a lack of awareness, as they believed they could reset CBs once without notifying the Captain. The Captain emphasized that flight attendants should always inform the Captain of any CB issues and highlighted the importance of adhering to safety protocols. The Captain recommended implementing a system-wide electronic message to remind all flight attendants of the CB policy and their responsibility to report discrepancies to the Captain. Additionally, periodic training was suggested to reinforce these procedures. The Captain also expressed concern about instances where flight attendants bypassed the Captain to communicate directly with Maintenance, even when the Captain was present.",training

I knew we were too high to land and that our landing did not feel normal. The plane started to sink; and we heard the engines being pushed to throttle and we thought the pilot was going to possibly attempt a go-around. We hit the runway incredibly hard bounced up in the air and then I felt the right wing tip way to way close to the ground. I was actually looking outside to see just how close we were to hitting the wing tip and rolling over. At this point the plane was sideways and was squirreling all over the place. I thought we were going to have a crash landing. After we got to the gate at no time did the pilots call back and see if we were ok. The pilots at no time made a P.A. to the people about what had just happened. After the passengers deplaned and we got up to the flight deck; myself and the Number 2 Flight Attendant; we asked the Number 1 Flight Attendant where the flight deck was. Number 1 stated the Captain told her; 'I can't believe I almost crashed this plane and took off outside to look at the plane'. After our 2nd terrifying landing in 2 weeks on another 737; and not being able to talk to our Captain or First Officer; the Numbner 2 and I removed ourselves from our last two legs of our trip. We both were shook up. This was our 2nd unreal and terrible distressing landing in 2 weeks. On both of these incidents the weather did not play a factor. It was sunny and warm. On our flight back to base one of our 737 Captains had just finished his recurrent training. We had both flown many times together without such incidents taking place. He was the only pilot to give us some possible explanations. One; on the earlier incident; the Captain was new to the left seat and needs additional training. Or two it was a max flaps 40 involvement. He explained that some pilots like to practice using the 40 setting; when it really is only supposed to be used on short runways like LGA; DCA; and BOS. At our meeting; the Chief Pilot was initially in the meeting and told my friend and I that; 'this would happen again.' This statement was shocking to us because we have both flown this plane many times without these terrible landings taking place. It should be noted that for many years both Number 2 and I have flown the 737 and every plane this airline has had and never had any landings like these last two.This incident was on our first trip of the month. The earlier event; we had completed a turn I was the Number 4 Flight Attendant; and my friend was the Number 2 Flight Attendant on this flight. This was a really terrifying landing. The Captain came on the P.A. and told us and the passengers that it was 84 degrees and the wind was 5 MPH. He then told us to prepare for landing. My friend and I prepared the cabin and did our final cabin checks and took our jump seats and belted in. We first started to feel our plane did not feel right as we were around approximately 1;000 FT. We looked at each other and looked outside to see how close we were getting to touching down. As we stated to get closer to landing we both knew that everything about this landing did not feel normal; the position of the plane and the attitude. We hit so hard the plane bounced 8 to 9 feet; slammed down again on the runway and we bounced another 5 feet; and then our planes wings tipped so low to the ground; they went right to left and I told my friend to 'cover her eyes.' We both felt the plane was going to crash. After we got to the gate again the pilots never came on to talk to the passengers or to us the crew. By the time the Number 2 and I got up to the flight deck the Captain was gone. My friend spoke to the First Officer; and asked; 'what just happened; what was the landing all about?' The First Officer replied something about the winds; and my friend said no; there was no wind. Then the First Officer told my friend 'that the Captain was fairly new to the left seat'. This was a terrifying landing.,,The event occurred because the pilot lost wind. He was going to do a go-around but decided to land the aircraft because he was lined up. However; we were still too high when he landed and we knew he was making a decision when we heard the engines flare and then we dropped down around 50 feet to the ground.We are the eyes and ears of this operation so everyone says. However; when we have negative issues to discuss most pilots leave us hanging with unresolved answers and emotions. Yes; we are able to feel when things are off with the engines; landings; weather. If the only thing the pilot is worried about is his aircraft and not his crew; we have a long way to go. A pilot that clearly knows that an incident occurred should at the very least call back and make sure that his crew is ok. If he could provide information as to what happened; would be great. Everyone says the back of the B737 feels totally different from the front of the aircraft and it's true.,,Two B737-800 Flight Attendants report a Captain; apparently new to the left seat; lost control of the aircraft in the flare and made a very hard landing which resulted in two bounces before coming to stop.,"The incident involved two hard landings on a B737-800 aircraft, experienced by two flight attendants during separate flights. In both cases, the landings were described as abnormal, with the aircraft feeling unstable and the pilots failing to communicate effectively with the cabin crew or passengers afterward. The first landing occurred during final approach, with the aircraft feeling too high before touchdown. The plane bounced upon impact, with the right wing tip nearly touching the ground, causing concern among the flight attendants about a potential crash. After the incident, the pilots did not address the crew or passengers, leaving the flight attendants unsettled. The second landing was similarly hard, with the aircraft bouncing multiple times and the wings tilting dangerously low. The flight attendants reported that the captain, who was apparently new to the left seat, lost control during the flare. After landing, the captain did not communicate with the crew, and the first officer mentioned the captain's inexperience as a possible contributing factor. Both incidents occurred under clear weather conditions, with no apparent external factors. The flight attendants expressed frustration over the lack of communication from the pilots and the unresolved nature of the incidents. They also noted that the captain may have been practicing with max flaps 40, which is typically reserved for short runways, as a potential factor in the hard landings. The flight attendants removed themselves from their duties following the second incident, citing the traumatic nature of the events and their concern for safety. The chief pilot acknowledged the issue but did not provide a definitive resolution, leaving the flight attendants shaken and uncertain about future flights. The attendants suggested that the captain, who was new to the left seat, may require additional training, particularly regarding the appropriate use of flaps during landing. They also emphasized the need for better communication between pilots and cabin crew in the event of an incident.",training

Called Maintenance as the IFE Contractor had put an entry in the logbook as accomplished work card 23-32-00 (ops check system normal). RJAA Maintenance arrived at the gate and I asked him if he could remove the system placard. He called the IFE Technician to the plane who then told me that the system worked but needed further troubleshooting. Logbook items 12; 13; 14 & 16 all addressed parts of the IFE system. Local Maintenance did not clear the IFE placard. Per the MEL 23-10 and NEF 23-33b; I instructed the Purser not to use the IFE system for any of the required passenger safety briefings; or other pre-recorded announcements. After departure; I was made aware that the IFE system was used for the passenger safety demo. Apparently; the Purser decided to use the system after being instructed by me (Captain) not to use this equipment.  AFTER GATE ARRIVAL THE PURSER CAME TO COCKPIT; I DISCUSSED WITH HER THE VIOLATION OF POLICY AND POSSIBLE FAR'S REGARDING USE OF AN AIRCRAFT SYSTEM THAT WAS ON MEL PLACARD; AND THAT THE FINAL AUTHORITY FOR OPERATION OF COMPANY EQUIPMENT RESTS WITH THE CAPTAIN DESIGNATED ON THE FLIGHT RELEASE.  SHE TOLD ME THAT THE MECHANICS; AS THEY LEFT THE AIRCRAFT IN TOKYO; TOLD HER THE SYSTEM WAS FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND TO USE IT.  I POINTED OUT THAT THE CAPTAIN HAS THE LAST SAY REGARDING USE OF EQUIPMENT ON COMPANY AIRCRAFT AND THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE COORDINATED WHAT SHE BELIEVED PROPER USE WITH THE CAPTAIN AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY TOLD HER SPECIFICALLY NOT TO USE THE PRE-RECORDED PORTION OF THE IFE SYSTEM AS IT WAS PLACARDED INOP.,,Captain reviewed the logbook items and spoke to both the Narita Mechanic and two tech reps about the issue. [Captain] then declared that the IFE system would not be used by crew. In the course of the flight; it was discovered that the cabin crew made an attempt to utilize the IFE system which proved unsuccessful. Considering the consequences of an MD-11 accident and other experiences with IFE malfunctions and fires; adherence to Captain's directive needs to trump cabin crew intuition. Additionally; MEL/CDL/NEF guidance concerning placarding is vague and needs to be reduced to plain language with the mutual consent of the company and the FAA. This is the second time I've witnessed a problem involving crews and Maintenance personnel not understanding placarding procedures. This entire situation might've been averted if placarding guidance had clearly stated that an INOP sticker needed to be placed on the ON/OFF switch at the IFE control console.Remind cabin crew of Captain's authority. Simplify guidance for installing INOP stickers for MEL/CDU/NEF items; particularly those in the cabin.,,B777 Captain is informed after the fact that the Purser attempted to use the IFE system for passenger briefing after being advised that it was inoperative on MEL and not to be used.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and the flight attendant regarding the use of an inoperative In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) system on a B777 aircraft. The IFE system was placarded as inoperative (MEL 23-10) and the captain had instructed the purser not to use it for passenger safety briefings or other pre-recorded announcements. Despite this directive, the purser attempted to use the system during the safety briefing, believing it was functional based on communication with maintenance personnel. After the flight, the captain addressed the issue with the purser, emphasizing the captain's authority as the final decision-maker regarding the use of company equipment. The purser argued that maintenance had indicated the system was functional. The captain stressed the importance of adhering to MEL directives and the potential risks associated with using unapproved systems, referencing past incidents involving IFE malfunctions. The incident highlighted a gap in understanding of placarding procedures, with the captain proposing that guidance on MEL/CDL/NEF placarding should be simplified and standardized, particularly for systems in the cabin. Additionally, the captain recommended ensuring cabin crew awareness of the captain's authority and the importance of coordinating with the flight deck before using systems that are placarded inoperative. The B777 captain discovered that the purser had attempted to use the inoperative IFE system for passenger safety briefings despite being explicitly instructed not to do so. The purser believed the system was functional based on communication with maintenance. The captain emphasized the importance of adhering to MEL directives and clarified their authority as the final decision-maker. The incident underscored the need for clearer guidance on placarding procedures and cabin crew coordination with the flight deck.",training

Discussed the light with the Captain and because of the likelihood of a long delay in ZZZ; we elected to come to ZZZ1 and report the light 'On'. In ZZZ1; Maintenance found enough debris that the aircraft was removed from service to flush the oil system and recheck for debris. [Contributors]:1) There is no guidance for the flight crew regarding the chip detector. It is not part of the normal preflight inspection but the light is obvious if 'On'. Without guidance there is confusion as to whether this is something we should check or even be concerned about if it is 'On'. 2) The most common time to find this light 'On'; is during the first flight of the day preflight which is usually at an outstation. Due to the difficulty of getting Maintenance to the Outstation and the likelihood of a lengthy delay; it is difficult to convince myself; much less the Captain; that we should report the problem at the Outstation. This is the second time in the last two months I have delayed reporting the light 'On' to avoid delay at the Outstation. This is the first time out of six previous that required more than a simple cleaning of the detector.

After discussing the issue with the Captain, they decided to divert to ZZZ1 due to concerns about potential delays at the outstation. Upon arrival, Maintenance discovered sufficient debris in the chip detector, leading to the aircraft being removed from service for oil system flushing and reinspection. Contributors to the incident included the lack of clear guidelines for flight crew regarding the chip detector light, which is not part of the standard preflight inspection. The First Officer noted that the light frequently illuminated during the first flight of the day at outstations, and the difficulty of obtaining timely Maintenance support at remote locations compounded the decision to delay reporting. This was the second occurrence in two months, with the first five instances requiring only a simple cleaning of the detector. To prevent future occurrences, the First Officer recommended the establishment of clear guidelines for flight crew actions when the chip detector light is illuminated, aiming to address confusion and reduce the risk of similar incidents.",training

After the [onboard] services; the crews have been putting aluminum cans in the New Tech electrical [food] carts. When I made this known to the [more experienced] flight attendant crews; the response was negative and I quote that their response is 'This is what we have always done.' I am considered a Junior Flight Attendant. The carts have shown malfunction from the collaboration of the aluminum and electrical appliances. If abused it can cause other malfunctions to the electrical system(s) of the aircraft. ALL New Tech Carts hold HEAT!!!! When aluminum is introduced to the hot electrical plates it can cause an explosion. I was told that they do it because they are not going to plug the carts back up to the electrical [cord.] But what happens when the next crew uses the carts? The [residue] cannot be washed away. I believe that is what they think; or burned away using the integrity of the airplanes electrical heating systems. AGAIN; this has been practiced numerous times. My response is I am not stupid to the following working crew. And they wonder why we have mechanical problems with the planes. The [aluminum] can explode if they continue to practice this method [or] attitude.,Reporter stated the New Tech Carts can chill or heat food. Switches for the cooling or heating of carts are located at the Galley's upper panel. Only the Aft Galley on their B747's currently use the New Tech Carts. An electrical cord from each cart is connected to another cord supplying electrical power for heat or cold. Older carts were either chiller or hot carts; not both.Reporter stated her concern was the potential for the used aluminum cans to melt on the heating pads and releasing mercury or some other fumes. Heating pads are believed to be made of a ceramic/metal material. Another concern was the lack of training for many of the flight attendants who just don't understand how the New Tech Cart's function. Many times she has found flight attendants trying to heat food while they also had the chiller switch 'On' and complaining the heater was not working. Reporter noted she has nineteen years flying experience.,,,A Flight Attendant describes the potential for electrical malfunctions caused by stowage of empty aluminum cans in the New Tech Cart food trays and the lack of training for the proper operation of the carts on B747-400 aircraft.,"The incident involved a conflict between two flight attendants regarding the improper storage of empty aluminum cans in the New Tech electrical carts used for heating and cooking meals on a B747-400 aircraft.

Despite their concerns, the more experienced flight attendants dismissed the issue, stating it was a longstanding practice. The junior attendant emphasized the safety risks and lack of proper training on the aircraft's electrical systems, expressing frustration over what they perceived as unsafe habits contributing to mechanical issues.

The aircraft also had one MEL; the APU was inoperative; so we had to do an external air start at the gate. While taxiing to the runway; we performed a cross bleed start on the number one engine. Everything was normal during the taxi; beside the aircraft getting warm while using the bleed air to operate the air conditioning packs.We were in the takeoff roll; well past 80 KTS and approaching V1 when we received a call chime from the Flight Attendant. I was the pilot flying and decided to continue the takeoff; as we were within a few KTS of V1. While I was rotating the aircraft; we received a second call from the Flight Attendant using the cabin emergency call button. After raising the gear and configuring the aircraft; the First Officer answered the call. She said; 'There's smoke in the cabin; down the floor aisle.' We immediately informed Tower of the situation and that we would like to return. At the same time; the Flight Attendant called back saying she was seeing smoke coming out from along the aisle; down around where the emergency lights are. I asked her if it smelled like smoke; a burning smell; or an electrical smell. She went to investigate and then call us back.We were still on the SID and I had started to level off back down to 3;000 FT.The Flight Attendant called back and said that there is no smell at all; the smoke is like a mist; and it is cold air coming out. Tower at this time asked us if we would like to land on [Runway] XXR or YYR. We informed the Tower that we were still analyzing the problem; so he sent us to Departure. We contacted Departure and he had us fly heading 185 degrees and climb to 4;000 FT.The Flight Attendant called us to say that the smoke had gone away; but as soon as I added thrust to climb to 4;000 FT the smoke reappeared. I asked if there was any smell again and she said no; and [that] it was still cold air coming out. All this happened in a very short time frame. At this time we realized that it was not smoke; but condensation coming from the air conditioning packs. We had received no indications of anything abnormal in the cockpit; no EICAS messages; and all readings on the systems page of the MFD were normal. The cabin was warm and humid from the taxi out; so the temperature control was set to cold on the Flight Attendant control panel.At this point; Departure asked us what we wanted to do. We talked about that if we returned we would have to perform an overweight landing; around 4;500 LBS overweight. We decided it was safe to continue the flight. Departure gave us a heading to rejoin the SID; which put us on a heading that we could return if need be.The Flight Attendant called us back to say the condensation was gone and had not returned. At no time while talking with Tower or Departure did we declare an emergency; only saying initially to the Tower that we needed to return to the airport. That was before we had all the information about what was happening in the cabin. Only after evaluating the facts did we decide not to return.Concentrating on planning a return overweight landing while running checklists; coordinating with ATC; and communicating with the Flight Attendant can lead to missed steps. I must continue to stay vigilant and not rush through things while also maintaining the safety of the aircraft; passengers; and crew. Also; [while] not dismissing the Flight Attendant's call; [I should] not be distracted by it during the critical phase of takeoff (especially near or at V1) until it is safe to answer. I never want to discourage anyone on the flight crew to inform me if there is a problem or safety issue.,,To prevent this type of situation from occurring again; flight crew should be aware of the difference between smoke and mist from the air conditioning packs.,,An E145 flight crew continued their takeoff when the Flight Attendant called as they approached V1. After airborne the Attendant advised of 'smoke' coming from the floor of the cabin. The smoke eventually was determined to be condensation from the air conditioning system as it cooled the hot humid air. The flight continued to its destination when the condensation was identified and later abated.,"The incident involved an E145 aircraft with an inoperative Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), requiring an external air start. During takeoff, the flight attendant reported ""smoke"" in the cabin, prompting the flight crew to consider returning to the airport. However, after further investigation, the ""smoke"" was identified as condensation from the air conditioning packs, which was exacerbated by the warm and humid cabin air from the taxi. The flight crew ultimately decided to continue the flight after the condensation dissipated and determined there was no immediate threat to safety. The proposed solution emphasizes the importance for flight crew to recognize the difference between smoke and condensation from the air conditioning system.",training

The conversation seemed to be slightly longer than normal and so when the First Officer returned to the radio the Captain inquired if there was something wrong. During relaying this information to the Captain; the flight crew missed the hold short of L3. Air Traffic Control inquired about this and immediately issued a clearance to continue on Mike to hold short of 9L at M2.

The aircraft was in taxi out mode. The other Flight Attendant noticed that the safety strap at the L2 door was stuck in the door. I tried to pull it back in; but it would not budge. I saw some light coming through from where the strap was. I called the flightdeck; apologized for interrupting; and asked if they were showing any indications of the integrity of the seal being breeched. He said everything looked fine. I told him about the strap. I said that if he could stop the aircraft; I could quickly crack the door and bring the strap back in. He said it wasn't as easy as that because the aircraft was already pressurized. I then asked him what the ramifications could be if we left it alone. He said that it might cause a squealing sound on climb but should eventually go away when we leveled off. So; I said as long as there weren't any warning bells; and he was comfortable with leaving it; then I would leave it alone. I also said that I would contact him if anything happened. As soon as we took off; the door started squealing; and it actually got louder the higher we went. It could be heard full force all the way up to the divider. It was like a horn being blown. I waited until 10;000 to see if it would go away; but it didn't. I called the pilots; and they could hear it over the intercom without me telling them. He suggested putting a wet rag on it. That didn't do anything. No one was complaining about any physical reactions; except the other Flight Attendant was getting a headache. The noise was just so obnoxiously loud that it wasn't right to put the passengers through it. So; the Captain returned to the departure airport. On the ground; a mechanic from one of the smaller airlines; came and checked out the door seal; said it was fine; we took on more gas; and we left. Maybe emphasizing something like 'strap check' in the whole door closure routine.,,Excessively loud squeal from L2 Door caused by safety strap caught in door pressure seal. [I] elected to return to the departure airport to remove safety strap. Flight Attendant called us in the cockpit from the back of the aircraft while we were approaching the runway prior to takeoff to advise us that a safety strap was caught in an aft service/entry door. After a discussion of the situation with the crew and verification by the Flight Attendant visually and by cockpit indication that the doors were closed and locked; my assessment was that there were no associated safety of flight issues and no risk of damage to the aircraft. I discussed my assessment with the crew; considered the alternatives and the comfort level of the crew with the process; and elected to go. As is the case in situations like this; there were factors that biased my assessment that it would be OK to fly with the strap in the door frame. My bias factors were: 1. Previous experience. I had experienced safety straps in the doors of Boeing aircraft on occasion over the years; and had discussed with others their experiences. That basis of experience set my frame of reference to the situation. My mindset was that if there was no metal piece of the strap caught in the door; and nothing extending to the outside of the door; that we could operate with safety and without risk of aircraft damage. 2. Progress of flight and operational considerations. We were operating out of an airport without a Control Tower; with a limitation for one IFR or special VFR aircraft allowed to operate in the airspace at a time. We had our clearance; and had aircraft waiting behind us to receive their clearance after we exited the airspace. We discussed the possibility of having the Flight Attendant pop open the door and pull the strap in; but we were pre-pressurized for takeoff and I was not keen on the safety aspect of having the door popped open without stairs up to the aircraft. So the remaining option was to taxi down the runway and back to the ramp; shut down; bring the stairs; and open the door to clear the strap. That option also would have made it necessary to refuel to bring us back to our required fuel after the taxi burn; which at this particular airport equates to a significant wait time for the fueler to show up. Did I make the right choice? No. That was apparent to me immediately during climbout when the flight attendants called on the Service Interphone and I could hear the squeal in the background. I had heard pressure squeals in the past but nothing close to the loudness of this one. Would I make that choice again? No. What I will do and what I would share with other crews is that it is necessary to clear the strap from the door frame prior to flight. Doesn't matter if it requires a taxi-back; another de-ice; more fuel; ATC clearance issues; or any other operationally undesirable factors which exist.,,A B737's L2 door safety strap was trapped in the door seal after it was closed but the crew decided to depart only to return to the departure airport because of the excessively loud squeal.,"The incident involved a safety strap on the B737's L2 door becoming trapped during closure. The flight attendant noticed the issue and informed the cockpit, but the pilots assessed it as low risk, deciding to proceed with takeoff. During the flight, a loud squealing noise developed, prompting an immediate return to the departure airport. Mechanics confirmed the door's integrity, and the flight resumed after refueling. The flight attendant suggested incorporating a more thorough strap check into pre-flight procedures. The pilot acknowledged bias from past experiences and operational constraints, learning the importance of resolving such issues before takeoff to prevent disruptions.",training

I advised Commercial radio and a discrete HF frequency was arranged and the patch was made. An on board ER nurse attended the passenger; made evaluations; provided treatment; and talked directly to Medlink. Medlink advised that we could continue and to provide O2 as needed. The Flight Attendant advised that they were using the Therapeutic O2 bottle. The Flight Attendant later advised us when the therapeutic bottle reached 250 PSI and a decompression bottle was used. As we still had several hours of flying; we discussed O2 use; and operational restrictions regarding depletion of O2 bottles. The First Officer and I discussed that the safest course of action; regardless of O2 quantities; would be to remain at altitude. I advised the First Officer that I was exercising Captains Emergency Authority in the event any of those bottles went below the prescribed volumes in order to remain at altitude. I discussed an O2 use plan with the Flight Attendant. We discussed using one decompression bottle to 1;500 PSI; then switch to the other decompression bottle; and use it until depleted. Shortly afterwards; she advised me that the first decompression bottle was at 1;250 PSI. I told her to switch to decompression bottle two; use it to 1;500 PSI; then use decompression bottle one; and deplete it. My thought was to ensure the Flight Attendant's maintained full capabilities in their mobility bottles. Shortly after this discussion; the  Flight Attendant advised that they could use their mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. With this information we revised our plan to include the mobility bottles as long as they ensured the mobility bottles did not go below 1;000 PSI. ACARS messages were sent to Dispatch advising them of the O2 usage and the volume levels of the bottles. After the second decompression bottle was used to 1;500 PSI; two mobility bottles were depleted to 1;000 PSI and a third was being used as we began our descent. Upon landing we were met by medics and the passenger was transported to medical facilities. Once we were deplaned I discussed O2 bottle usage with the Flight Attendants to ensure I fully understood the amount used. I discovered that the therapeutic bottle was depleted to 250 PSI; the number one decompression bottle to 250 PSI; number two to 1;500 PSI; and two mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. Mechanics boarded the aircraft; were advised and we discussed the write ups of the bottles as well as the EMK. [We were in a] high workload environment in ETOPS airspace. Medlink event happened near a waypoint with need to arrange for Medlink; plot; and report waypoints; monitor Medlink transmissions via HF; and derive an O2 use plan with Flight Attendant's that would be sufficient for a number of hours. There appeared to be confusion between the naming conventions of each type of bottle and the amount we could use before encountering altitude restrictions. I thought that the Flight Attendant was trading the names of the therapeutic bottle and the decompression bottle. Once on the ground I discovered that both the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle were depleted to 250 PSI.,,,,An  Air Carrier flight crew depleted their cabin oxygen bottles below acceptable limits while treating a passenger who became ill near the ETP. There was confusion with naming conventions of the bottles and operational restrictions.,"The incident involved a flight crew and a flight attendant responding to a passenger illness requiring medical attention during a flight in ETOPS airspace. The flight attendant initially requested Medlink assistance, and the crew arranged for a discrete HF frequency to facilitate communication. An onboard emergency room nurse evaluated the passenger, and Medlink advised continuing the flight while providing oxygen as needed. The flight attendant used a therapeutic oxygen bottle, later switching to decompression bottles and mobility bottles as the flight progressed. Despite efforts to manage oxygen levels, confusion arose regarding the naming conventions and operational restrictions of the oxygen bottles. As a result, some bottles were depleted below prescribed limits. Upon landing, the crew reviewed the oxygen usage and discovered discrepancies in the bottle levels, including the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle being depleted to 250 PSI. Mechanics were boarded to address the oxygen bottle write-ups and ensure compliance with safety standards. Post-incident, the crew discussed the oxygen bottle usage to clarify naming conventions and prevent future operational issues.",training

Why? Our inbound flight was delayed more than 2 hours so the turn time was very quick. The Agent was very hurried to get the plane cleaned and get it out ASAP. I was greeting passengers. When they were all boarded; the number three Flight Attendant came to the front to say [that the] exits were briefed. At that point we were all near the front door.The Agent closed the door and pulled the jetway and the Purser said to arm doors. Number three and I then walked to the back of the plane; planning to arm the doors. As I left the front of the plane I realized I had a personal problem. I walked back to get something out of my bag and told my partner I needed to take care of something and went to the lavatory. She; at that time; was also getting something out of the other lavatory for a passenger. When I came out she was in the jumpseat; so I put my bag away and sat down; forgetting to arm my door.Shortly after takeoff; I noticed her door wasn't armed; then looked at mine and realized both doors did not get armed. We then both armed our doors.We later tried to go over the reasons why this happened. I believe the number one reason was trying to rush our departure combined with distractions that happened right as we needed to arm our doors.,,,,Caught up in a maelstrom of activity and the need to address a personal problem as their departure was rushed due to a late arrival; two flight attendants aboard an A320 realized only after takeoff that neither had armed their door for departure.,"The incident occurred when two flight attendants on an A320 failed to arm their respective doors before takeoff. The cause was attributed to a rushed departure due to a delayed flight and a quick turnaround, combined with personal distractions. After takeoff, both attendants noticed the doors were not armed and promptly secured them. The situation was resolved without further issues.",training
