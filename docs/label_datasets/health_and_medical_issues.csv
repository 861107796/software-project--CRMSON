Bio hazard found by Flight Attendants behind last row of seats in economy. Plane had already pushed back from the gate. Crew voiced concerns about the finding and I held conversation with Captain about crew concerns. Captain initiated a conversation with operations; and I went to the rear of the plane to investigate the situation further. The biohazard bag had not been closed so I put on gloves and carefully looked  inside. The contents were soiled; linens; wipes; and the dustpan from the large bag. After discussion with the crew; we agreed that we were happy to put the bag into a sealed container as we knew what the contents were. I returned to door; and reported my findings to the Captain and also of the conversation amongst the crew. Had the bag being sealed and tied it was agreed amongst the crew that none of us were happy or comfortable; taking the bag on a flight due to security concerns; and we would have wanted to have had the bag removed. This situation could have been avoided had there been more time to do a thorough cleaning of the aircraft and for the flight attendants to do their thorough checks before passengers; started boarding,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported notifying the Captain of a 'Bio hazard' container of soiled linen during departure taxi.

The first class wasn't even deplaned. Only three people had deplaned while others were trying to get their bag down and deplane. I said no not at this point; which in turn the first cleaner gave me serious attitude. The Gate Agent came down; no mask on; with an attitude about us not letting the cleaners enter to clean. They had 12 people to clean; usually they have a shortage of cleaners. But we hadn't even had first class passengers cleared and they started coming on. I asked not yet; let the passengers deplane and this flight is a full flight. This is becoming a serious issue at times and passengers getting upset they can't deplane and usually the cleaners keep cleaning and not moving in so they can deplane. Understand at this time with COVID the importance of cleaning but passengers complain at me about cleaners not clearing so the could deplane. It's stressful enough with all we are dealing with no food drinks and upset passengers about what they can't have. Our passengers were moving quick and not stalling getting off.  When they were off we couldn't get our bags and personal items together.  The flight deck wasn't able to exit. I understand there is time a limit and all but this rushing is going to seriously cause problems with safety of crew and passengers.  I was wrong possibly and maybe for which i will follow these memo's I forgot about from now on. Just trying to give our paying passengers a pleasant and safe flight including safe deplaning.,,,,Flight Attendant reported there was no social distancing by the aircraft cleaners during deplaning and also stated the Gate Agent was not wearing a face mask.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and ground personnel during the deplaning process of a full flight. The cleaning crew requested early access to clean the first-class section before all passengers had deplaned, which the flight attendant initially refused. This led to tension, as the cleaning crew and a gate agent, who arrived without a face mask, displayed an attitude. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of passenger safety and deplaning efficiency, citing stress from COVID-related protocols and passenger concerns. After deplaning was complete, the crew faced delays in retrieving their belongings, and the flight deck remained inaccessible. The flight attendant acknowledged potential oversights and expressed a commitment to follow procedures, highlighting the need for safe and efficient passenger experiences.",health and medical issues

We were confused by this question because we had been uniformed of any issues regarding our flight. Then he proceeded to tell us that there was an air quality issue with that aircraft. We were even more confused as to why we were not made aware of this issue and wanted confirmation or at least more information about what we were dealing with. He then left us and we began communication with CSS (Cabin Service System); and tried to contact a Supervisor. We then learned that it was in fact our aircraft; and they were now tail swapping it out of service. I am unclear on what we should be doing; if we should be concerned for our health; or be tested? I was under the impression that the Supervisor who first approached us would return with more information or at least confirm that it was our flight. I am not feeling well; but I am unsure now if I was already getting sick; or if it was caused or exasperated by this aircraft.

While our country is currently in a national emergency; any serious medical event leads to uncertainty. All three flight attendants were in constant communication with the Captain. At first we were told no passengers could leave the aircraft when we landed. We had passengers who were aware of the situation and wanted to be involved. Of course our first priority was the safety of our passengers and crew; we also were aware of the effect any decision would have on the company. After discussion with Station Ops and Dispatch; the Captain was instructed to not hold the passengers; and that the aircraft would be cleaned upon arrival. We also spent the entire flight containing the incident so all passengers felt at ease about their safety. I felt we were successful. However; in this coronavirus environment; it was very stressful and we had to remain calm and in control. We were dealing with many different situations and important decisions during the flight.,,After the deplaning of Flight XYZ from ZZZ to ZZZ1; the one of the crew members failed to stay with the XX through passengers. During this flight; we encountered many distractions including a passenger that vomited in the forward lav and we alerted the Captain due to the national concern over the scare of the coronavirus.

Originally I was told that there was a passenger at the gate who does not have a face mask isn't going to wear one. Also that that passenger was telling people at the gate of having had the virus already. On top of that I was told this passenger had a medical problem they were traveling to ZZZ to be worked on. I was also hearing that passenger was being disruptive.One of my flight attendants had a concern of this passenger still being contagious and being a disruptive passenger. With the passenger still being at the gate I started to receive more information I was told to contact MedLink. Turns out that the gate had already been in touch with MedLink and the passenger had already been cleared by MedLink. As for the pre-existing medical condition; the passenger told the gate of not wearing a mask because it causes asthma attacks. I verified this to be a possibility with MedLink on my side.As for the disruptive behavior I spoke with the station manager and he informed me that the passenger was being cooperative and only just understandably a little frustrated. I asked him if he thought passenger would be an issue in flight and he indicated that he did not believe that to be the case. After speaking with my flight attendant about her concerns we decided they had all been resolved and we allowed the passenger to board the flight.

It created an uncomfortable work situation where I had to decide between feeling safe; and wanting to maintain peace. For the rest of the trip not only was my health put at risk; but others were as well. From other cabin to each and every passenger on board; our health was more at risk then it needs to be due to non-compliance of a requirement.To avoid a lack of CRM and a situation where FAs might become hostile towards each other; as well as for everyone's health and safety; masks must be mandated unless strictly for medical reasons.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that another Flight Attendant refused to wear a mask during boarding and throughout the flight.

He said that he was about to start coughing.  Once inside the lav; we (myself and other passengers) could hear him coughing so hard that he was gagging.  2 passengers expressed concern.  When he came out; I asked if he was feeling alright.  He told me that it was just allergies and he didn't want to start coughing in front of everyone.  Twice; during taxi; I had to ask him to put his mask back on. (Note: if someone is eating or drinking; I leave them alone.  But he was reading and/or digging through his bags.)  In flight; as soon as I went upfront; we went into the lav again after 2 more lav visits; I went back and asked him again if he was alright.  He told me that he 'Wasn't feeling well;' but that it was because he hadn't eaten breakfast. We provided everyone with snack bags and I kept an eye on him.  After several more lav trips; I called the PIC and informed him of what was going on.  The PIC asked us if we had a way of taking his temp.

I told him that we were about to land and that he needed to return to his seat.  He wasn't happy; but complied.  After arriving at the gate; he came back to use the lav again.  The PIC called and asked if we (the FAs) would ask him to stay seated until everyone else had deplaned so someone to talk with him.  I asked him and he was very unhappy and agreed while yanking off his mask. I must have looked surprised because; after looking back at my face; he quickly put his mask back on.  He deplaned last and a [customer service agent] was there to meet him.  The other FA informed me that; when he first boarded the plane; he had immediately used the forward restroom.  That totaled 9 trips to the lav in 1.5-2 hrs and many requests to keep his mask on.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger using the restroom numerous times; coughing and having to constantly be reminded to wear a mask.,"During a flight, a **Flight Attendant (FA)** reported an incident involving a passenger, referred to as Passenger X, who exhibited unusual behavior. Passenger X used the restroom a total of **nine times** within a span of **1.5 to 2 hours**, which raised concerns among the crew and other passengers. Upon entering the restroom, Passenger X was heard coughing heavily, to the point of gagging, which worried two other passengers. When asked about his condition, he initially claimed it was due to allergies but later stated he was not feeling well because he had not eaten breakfast. The FA provided snack bags to all passengers and kept a close eye on Passenger X throughout the flight. Additionally, Passenger X was repeatedly reminded to wear his mask properly. The FA noted that he was reading or digging through his bags, which may have contributed to the need for mask reminders. The FA informed the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) about the situation, and the PIC requested that the FA check if there was a way to take Passenger X's temperature. Since the crew did not have a thermometer, the PIC suggested contacting a customer service agent to meet the flight. After landing, the PIC instructed the FA to ask Passenger X to remain seated until all other passengers had deplaned, so that someone could speak with him privately. Passenger X complied but was visibly unhappy and removed his mask in frustration. After noticing the FA's surprise, he quickly put the mask back on. Passenger X was the last to deplane and was met by a customer service agent at the gate. The FA later reported that Passenger X had used the forward restroom immediately after boarding the plane, adding to the total of nine restroom visits.

They explained they were unable to call an FA because they saw this while standing in the aisle several rows behind these people as all passengers waited to deplane. The two passengers were able to exit the aircraft before the other passengers could notify me. I assured them the plane was terminated and would be sanitized for the evening and we agreed that the only thing remaining we could do about it was to notify Operations and request they inform the cleaners of the location to take extra precautions to protect themselves and to sanitize that area thoroughly. The blood [was] intentionally smeared into an X shape on the wall. I presumed the blood came from tearing open a scab or some other small wound. It was a clearly visible amount but didn't indicate heavy bleeding.By the time [deplaning] was complete and I could go to row XX; most of the moisture from the saliva and nasal secretions had dried and was barely visible; only the blood stood out. Without their notification; and even with the easily visible blood; it would have been impossible to realize the extent to which they had contaminated every possible surface. It would have dried completely had we taken the time to tidy the aircraft first. In our PA about passenger compliance we emphasize seat belts and smoking and perhaps that is outdated and detracts from where the emphasis currently should lie. We state federal law prohibits tampering with a lav smoke detector; perhaps we have a law that prohibits passenger misconduct and could be stated in such a way that explains the criminality (if any) to such behavior. I do not believe those passengers believed they could face any consequence for these actions. Regardless of taking place during a pandemic; at any time this behavior poses a risk to other passengers; crew; and employees.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that two passengers were observed spitting; and wiping their saliva and blood over their entire seating area.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and two passengers (Party2) in seats XX5 and XX6.

The two passengers exited the aircraft before the other passengers could notify the flight attendant. The flight attendant terminated the flight and informed Operations to request cleaners to sanitize the affected area thoroughly. The blood was smeared in an X shape on the wall, likely from a small wound. The flight attendant noted that without the passengers' notification, the extent of the contamination would have gone unnoticed, as the saliva and secretions had dried by the time she could inspect the area.

No immediate solution was proposed for the passengers' actions, but the flight attendant emphasized the importance of addressing such behavior to protect other passengers, crew, and employees.",health and medical issues

I also asked if anybody felt uncomfortable with the small child taking the mask off at times while she is sitting far from everybody else and they all agreed it was OK. I told Captain the situation and they called a duty officer on their behalf to clear us to leave. The reason for making the exception made sense. She was at least 3 rows away from the nearest person; we avoided a meltdown; she was getting her camera ready and the bathroom in the back was inop so we knew nobody would go back there. I believe no further action was needed. We got guidance on the full procedure from our pilots and everyone was extremely grateful for a resolution to make everyone happy onboard.We need a better mask policy for children; especially if they might have a disability.,,Flight attendants reported that a child was unable to wear a face mask due to crying; resulting in a stressful situation. The child and parent were reseated and the situation was resolved.,"The incident occurred when a mother and her X-year-old child boarded the aircraft without the child wearing a mask. Despite the gate agents informing the mother that the child needed to wear a mask, the child refused, and the mother was unable to comply due to the child's distress. The flight attendant attempted to resolve the situation by offering a cookie to the child and moving the mother and child to a different seat to minimize discomfort for other passengers. The mother, who appeared stressed and emotional, was empathized with by the flight attendant, who acknowledged the challenges of the situation. The flight attendant also questioned the enforceability of mask policies for young children, especially those who may have disabilities. The situation was ultimately resolved without further action, as the mother and child were reseated away from other passengers, and the flight attendant sought guidance from the captain and duty officer. The flight attendant proposed the need for a more flexible mask policy for children, particularly those with disabilities.",health and medical issues

We called the customer service to notify her that a passenger appeared to be intoxicated. Customer service stated to me that the passenger did not appear to be intoxicated at that time. Under my observation; she did not appear that she was intoxicated. Enroute; I received a call from the Flight Attendant that the passenger was struggling to buckle her seatbelt and continued to take her mask off after multiple requests had been made. I made the non-compliance announcement for mask requirements; and she did not comply with the request either. We decided to have ZZZ1 customer service meet us at the gate to have the passenger removed. I notified Dispatch and ZZZ1 Operations to ensure we had someone meeting us at the aircraft. Upon arrival; customer service removed the passenger without any further issues. The event was caused by a passenger being intoxicated and a delayed reaction of the alcohol entering the blood stream; causing the effects of the alcohol to not become noticeable until enroute. Next time a passenger is appearing to be intoxicated; although multiple opinions on whether they appear to be intoxicated; have the passenger removed and tested for alcohol.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger appeared intoxicated during boarding; but was allowed to fly.  During the flight the passenger was non-compliant with face mask policy.,"The incident involved a passenger who appeared intoxicated during boarding, as reported by the flight attendant. Despite initial observations suggesting the passenger was not intoxicated, the effects of alcohol became noticeable enroute, leading to non-compliance with safety protocols, including mask requirements. The flight attendant contacted customer service, who met the aircraft upon arrival and removed the passenger without further issues. The cause of the incident was attributed to the delayed effects of alcohol on the passenger.

I was C; and could not see the seat from where I was standing in the exit row; and did not notice the passengers placing it during boarding.  I was busy greeting passengers as they walked through; and telling people who sat in the exit row that they were seated in the exit row; and verifying they were willing to sit there.  One woman was not responding to me; and I realized she could not hear me.  She said her ears were blocked from the last landing; and they had not cleared. Since she was unable to hear or respond to my questions; I told her I would have to re-seat her.  A gentleman in the exit row loudly said she was sick; and should not be allowed on the plane.  I asked her if she was sick; and she said no.  She appeared to be congested; which is likely the reason her ears blocked on landing.  I had her trade seats with another passenger; briefed the exit row and secured the forward cabin from the exit row forward.  When I got to the front; I informed A the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure.  I did not hear a PA that the aft cabin was secure. I informed the A that the woman I moved from the exit row could not hear; that she was congested but said she was not sick.  The A said she did not appear sick or have any COVID symptoms when she boarded. I said congestion could be a COVID symptom; and A seemed surprised; and said she never heard that.  By then operations was in front with us; and he and A said all I was required to do was ask if they are sick; and if the response is no; then we leave it alone.  I did not know if the passenger had allergies; a cold; or something more serious.The A was doing her final walk through prior to takeoff; and noticed a child seat directly behind the exit row. Someone notified the Captain; and A and D quickly had passengers change rows. The captain rang; I answered; and he asked if they were finished. I said I was C in front; and they were not quite done.

While conducting her duties, she was occupied with greeting passengers and ensuring that those seated in the exit row were willing to assume the responsibilities of that seat. A passenger in the exit row exhibited hearing difficulties, as she was unable to respond to the flight attendant's instructions. The passenger explained that her ears were blocked due to a prior landing, leading to congestion but not indicating that she was sick. The flight attendant attempted to reseat the passenger in accordance with safety protocols, but a gentleman seated nearby objected, claiming the passenger was sick and should not be on the plane. The passenger denied being sick, though her congestion raised concerns about potential COVID-19 symptoms. The flight attendant consulted with the captain and operations, who advised her that if the passenger was not explicitly sick or exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, she could remain on the plane. The flight attendant proceeded with reseating the passenger and securing the forward cabin. The incident was resolved after the flight attendant successfully completed the seat change and informed the captain that the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure.

She was still in the bathroom saying she was coming. FA3 and FA1 continued communicating with her and at less than 1 minute to landing the decision was made that she would not be able to safely make it to a seat and she was informed to 'stay in the lavatory.' The flight landed and taxied to toward Gate A19 at which time FA1 informed the Captain we had a passenger land in the lavatory. The Captain asked for basic information at this time. FA1 informed him that the passenger was still in the lavatory and if we were going to be stopped so she could return to her seat. The Captain stated; 'We're going to keep moving.' The passenger was told to remain in the lavatory until the seatbelt sign was turned off. Once we parked at the gate; the passenger came out on her own and apologized saying she was getting sick.

I asked more about this; feeling a little concerned as to what could have caused them to deny him boarding these previous days and if it could be an issue during the flight. They told me the previous days he had not wanted to board the plane. He had explained to them that he hadn't gotten sleep and also hadn't eaten. I'm not sure what happened those past few days but it was communicated that he had gotten enough sleep and was able to finally board the plane.I made sure to ask clearly if they thought there might be any issue during the flight or if there was anything I should know that could cause an issue in-flight.

Right before takeoff while we were still taxiing; [he] got up out of his seat and moved back a few rows to the exit row. I called the Captain and let him know someone was out of his seat. By this time [he] was seated a few rows back. The pilot made an announcement that everyone needed to be in their seat and then we took off. We just continued with taking off when we were scheduled.

Prior to starting the service; I witnessed [flying partner] remove her tote bag from the galley cart and take several pills.  [Flying partner] then had difficulty pushing and pulling the beverage cart with assistance.  It strained her and seemed very difficult for her to speak with customers; so I had prepared a sign in blue marker that read; 'What do you want to drink?' and listed beverages.  After picking up trash; [flying partner] repeatedly placed her used gloves on top of the galley counter.

We had two through Passengers onboard that were continuing on to ZZZ1.  I had a great conversation with them while I was tidying the aircraft.  Our D Flight Attendant was the first Inbound Crew Member to leave the plane.  There was a female Outbound Crew Member that came on to help clean; as well as a COVID-19 Cleaner from the Ramp. A second Outbound Crew Member came onboard as well; he stood in the forward entry area.  I heard the Inbound A Flight Attendant ask him if all of the Outbound Crew Members were at the gate; I guess he said yes because she collected her things walked off the plane.  The COVID-19 Cleaner and the Outbound Crew Member that helped us clean walked off the plane as well.  I also noticed that there was an Above the Wing Supervisor standing in the jet-bridge.  I think he was there because we arrived late and it was an aircraft booked FULL out of ZZZ to ZZZ1.  The two through passengers had moved from the back of the aircraft to the front of the aircraft and sat in row two.  They were seated below the overhead bin where my crew luggage was stowed; and they were asking me if they could use the lavatory.  I brought my things down and thanked the male Outbound Crew Member for stepping onto the plane.  I think that all of my other Crew Members had already walked off the plane; and that I was the last Inbound Crew Member to step off the plane.  This is the part were the COVID-19 Brain Fog comes in.  I'm not sure if the B Flight Attendant or myself was the last Inbound Crew Member to leave the plane.  I do know that there was only one Outbound Crew Member onboard an aircraft with through passengers onboard.  There was a lot going on during the crew change and I didn't think about having two Outbound Crew Members onboard before leaving the aircraft.  Three months ago I had an on the job COVID-19 infection; and I was off work for three months recovering.  I still have a couple of the COVID-19 'Long-haul' symptoms such as Brain Fog and some occasional fatigue.  I should have made sure that two Outbound Crew Members were onboard before I stepped off the plane.,,,,Air Carrier Flight Attendant reported a possible FAR violation due to an insufficient number of FAs on board while passengers were aboard. The Flight Attendant cited long lasting symptoms from COVID-19 that may have contributed to the event.,"A flight attendant reported a potential violation of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) due to insufficient crew during a crew change while passengers were onboard. The incident occurred when a flight attendant, Party1, was unsure whether the minimum number of flight attendants was present before leaving the aircraft. During the crew change, confusion arose as to who was on the plane, with only one outbound crew member present despite having through passengers. This uncertainty led to a possible FAR violation. The contributing factor was Party1's long-term COVID-19 symptoms, including brain fog and fatigue, which may have affected their ability to ensure compliance. To address this, the solution proposed is to verify the number of outbound crew members before leaving the aircraft, ensuring adherence to safety regulations.",health and medical issues

After speaking with the PAX (Passenger) she informed me that she had a highly contagious disease. After speaking with her; She explained that her illness wasn't airborne but someone could contract it if they touched anything she'd touched. I asked her for her name. Although; it was turbulent and we were on final descent; I contacted the cockpit they were informed of what was going on. I was told he couldn't talk at that time but did I need me Paramedics to meet us at the gate. I asked him to have a Supervisor meet the plane. The PAX was not in distress and showed no signs of needing immediate medical attention; therefore I didn't call for medical assistance. Once at the gate pure chaos erupted. Ops quickly opened the door allowed me to get off the plane then close and locked the jet bridge door which prohibited anyone from deplaning. I was trying to explain what was going on; meanwhile the Captain was trying to get into the jet bridge. I had to open the the door for him. Then I was told to make an announcement telling the PAX not to deplane. I checked on the UM (Unaccompanied Minor) and make sure he understood that he was okay. There were several Supervisors present. I was simultaneously speaking to them and Inflight. We had to wait for clearance to allow PAX off the plane. Together with Ops and Supervisors gathered all the facts so that they could inform the UM's parent's of the possible exposure. I was trying to keep the PAX that was in that same row with the ill PAX and the UM from deplaning as requested by the Supervisors. Pax were cleared to deplane; Supervisor took care of the UM and the PAX in that row deplaned with me getting her information. After everyone deplaned; I helped the ill PAX off the aircraft. I returned to the plane and cleaned the row with our onboard disinfectant. After that; I was talking to the Inflight SUP; trying to help a crew change; speaking with the Captain; updating my crew; and telling the outbound crew they could come down the jet way and board the aircraft. I did not get all the ill PAX information to put in my IR.Once we landed the pilots could have called us back and clarify what was going on. I feel if that would have happened; ground ops would not have went into lock down. Collectively we could have came up with a plan. Everyone plays a vital role but sometimes if we are not flying the plane we are made to feel less than for lack of a better word. I could only communicate the information I was given . We were in final descent but once we landed I did not feel comfortable contacting the cockpit. Once we landed the Captain never tried to contact us to clarify what was going on; which created a problem once we got to the gate and he was locked in. It was only at that time that he wanted know what was going on.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant in Charge reported a communications breakdown between Flight Attendant and flight crew shortly after being notified of a passenger with a 'highly contagious disease'.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between a flight attendant and the flight crew of a B737 aircraft, triggered by the presence of a passenger with a highly contagious disease. The flight attendant was informed by another crew member about the passenger, who had pre-boarded and requested that her seat be cleaned with Clorox after deplaning. Upon speaking with the passenger, the flight attendant learned that the individual had a contagious illness, which could be transmitted through contact but was not airborne. Despite the turbulence and being on final descent, the flight attendant contacted the cockpit, informing them of the situation. The cockpit, occupied by the captain, was unable to communicate at that time but was advised to have a supervisor meet the plane at the gate. The passenger was not in distress and did not require immediate medical attention, so the flight attendant did not call for emergency services. Upon landing, chaos erupted at the gate. Operations staff opened the door, allowing the flight attendant to deplane, but then locked the jet bridge, preventing other passengers from exiting. The captain attempted to enter the jet bridge, and the flight attendant was forced to open the door for him. The flight attendant was instructed to make an announcement asking passengers to remain on the plane, while supervisors gathered to collect information and inform the parents of an unaccompanied minor (UM) about potential exposure. The flight attendant worked to prevent the UM and other passengers in the affected row from deplaning, as requested by supervisors. Once cleared, passengers, including the UM, were allowed to exit, with the flight attendant collecting the ill passenger's information. After everyone had deplaned, the flight attendant assisted the ill passenger off the aircraft, cleaned the affected row with onboard disinfectant, and continued her duties, including coordinating with the inflight supervisor, the captain, and the outbound crew. The incident highlighted a breakdown in communication post-landing, as the captain did not contact the cabin crew to clarify the situation, leading to confusion and the subsequent lockdown. The flight attendant expressed frustration with the lack of communication and the resulting delays, suggesting that a coordinated approach could have been achieved if the captain had communicated with the cabin crew after landing. The proposed solution was for the captain to contact the cabin crew post-landing to avoid the lockdown and develop a unified plan. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of clear communication and collaboration among all crew members, regardless of their role.",health and medical issues

The passenger was informed to take a seat at mid to aft cabin due to distribution on the 800 aircraft; stating there is plenty of overhead bin space at the back for his carry on that seemed a bit large for the more narrow/less deep bins up front. The passenger snapped at the D Flight Attendant indicating that he was going to do what he wanted to do.Flight Attendant D recognized that the tall male passenger sat in the OWWE (Overwing Window Exit) Row. As the D made her way back she stopped to see how the passenger was doing. He was glossy eyed and loud. Flight Attendant D inquired if he had been smoking and under the influence of a substance. The passenger replied 'Yes; all day long.'  Flight Attendant D clarified if he were referring to Marijuana? The passenger replied 'Yes; I voted for it and I have been smoking all day long. We just signed a deal...' Then showing his logo/ clothing brand.The D Flight Attendant congratulated him on his business dealt then proceeded to inform the B Flight Attendant of the concern having a person under the influence of a substance in the OWWE. The B Flight Attendant concurred stating that 'Under the influence of a drug/marijuana is the same as alcohol.'The D Flight Attendant informed the A Flight Attendant of the concern then went up to the forward galley to discuss with the A [Flight Attendant]. The C Flight Attendant conducted the OWWE brief.The A [Flight Attendant] proceeded to talk to the passenger. The D Flight Attendant informed the flight deck both Captain and First Officer. No verbal response was given to the D Flight Attendant from the flight deck.The A Flight Attendant informed me; the D Flight Attendant that the man was okay.The D; said 'No he's not - he is admittedly in front of many passengers; I can smell the marijuana; under a controlled substance; approved use in Captain is only for use in the home and at a minimum he should not be in the OWWE; if even on this plane however even people who smell as if they've been drinking are not to be allowed to board.' The A Flight Attendant responded by saying; 'I spoke to him and leaned in and could not smell it.'Later the B Flight Attendant stated that he appears under the influence of marijuana/a substance and is eating a lot of pretzels; referring to the munchies.Later the C Flight Attendant stated that he (C) 'Heard how the passenger was talking to the D Flight Attendant and told him to settle down.' As the D Flight Attendant - the C heard that the passenger said he had been smoking marijuana all day long why was he allowed to remain in the overwing window exit?I think the FAM (Flight Attendant Manual) needs to clarify the term 'Intoxicated' to define if it only refers to alcohol or any substance to include marijuana; meth; speed; cocaine. Particular clarification is suggested with respect to marijuana as it is now legal in many states. However I don't think those laws supersede federal law or Federal Aviation Regulations. I think that the flight deck/ops made an error in allowing the passenger to remain in the OWWE; even if they wanted to approve a stoned/person under marijuana passenger to be able to remain on the plane. I think the fatal error was made in saying 'The A said the passenger was okay. 'If the A Flight Attendant has the final say then please clarify for crew.  The C and B Flight Attendants are still on probation and the A has not been flying too long. Being able to answer a question 'Yes; I will help' is not very reassuring when someone is under the influence of a primarily illegal substance even if it is legal in some states. It is a known fact that reaction time and mental processing of information is delayed under the influence of marijuana and other drugs; legal or illegal.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that a person under the influence of marijuana was allowed to remain seated in the emergency aisle after admitting being under the influence.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who encountered a passenger emitting the odor of marijuana. The passenger admitted to smoking marijuana throughout the day and refused to comply with instructions to move to the mid to aft cabin. Flight attendants noticed the passenger's behavior, including his glossy eyes and loud demeanor, and expressed concerns about his condition. They debated whether he should be removed from the overwing window exit seat due to safety concerns. The flight deck was informed but did not provide a verbal response. The A Flight Attendant deemed the passenger acceptable, while others, including the B and C Flight Attendants, disagreed, noting the passenger's behavior and the potential risks of marijuana use. The situation highlighted the need for clarification in the Flight Attendant Manual regarding the definition of ""intoxicated"" to include substances like marijuana, despite its legal status in some states. The crew's handling of the situation and the adequacy of their judgment were questioned.",health and medical issues

A paramedic and a nurse are assisting an ill passenger in seat 19b. Paramedics are waiting at destination. No ATC [notification was made].We see a small; individual cell ahead on radar: about 4 miles wide with light green rain indication and small amber center. We receive deviation clearance to the left from Control. We change course and continue descent. Visibility zero. When abeam of the cell on our right side; we flew through some imbedded cumulus and a short burst of rain. We received a quick; sudden jolt of moderate turbulence.I called back to the cabin via intercom to check with the cabin crew. I apologized about the event with no warning from us. I was assured that everything was okay although FA C sounded a bit unhappy about the event.We landed and arrived at the gate at [destination] with paramedics waiting to examine the ill passenger. A lot of confusion at the gate after the passengers deplaned with an army of cleaners coming aboard to 'turn' the aircraft. I saw FA A was moving aft to speak to FAs C and B while the cleaners and ground supervisors were on the airplane between us. The paramedics had left the jetway with the ill passenger. It was going to be difficult to wade through the cleaners to speak to my crew who were scheduled to fly the aircraft back to [origin]. Not having heard from them while at the gate; [First Officer] and I assumed our cabin crew were okay. We exited the aircraft to start our overnight.24 hours later; [First Officer] and I arrived at the aircraft for the northbound flight to [origin]. FA C and FA B were present and met us. It was then when we heard that they had sustained injury during the previous day while standing in the rear galley from the moderate turbulence jolt event. Both crew members complained of back and shoulder strain. In addition; FA C had sustained a small cut on her hand while grabbing a hand hold to steady herself.The event occurred because I failed to warn the cabin crew of possible moderate turbulence during descent. So; the crew was completing normal duties when the unexpected turbulence occurred. As is well known; turbulence effects are magnified when in the aft section of aircraft and also there was no warning of small bumps before the big jolt took place.I need to communicate better with my cabin crew during flight to warn them about turbulence ahead and also at the gate after such an event (by intercom; if necessary); to make sure that they are okay. I am not happy about my lack of knowledge about my cabin crew condition as I left the aircraft. One of my roles is to make sure they are okay and to assist them if they are not okay.,,,,A319 Captain reported learning the next day that Flight Attendants had been injured during an inbound turbulence encounter.,"An incident occurred during the descent of a flight, 100 miles north of the destination, where the flight crew encountered embedded thunderstorms with zero visibility. The flight crew deviated around a small thunderstorm cell, resulting in a sudden jolt of moderate turbulence. The cabin crew, including flight attendants B and C, were in the rear galley and were injured during the turbulence, sustaining back and shoulder strains, with FA C also receiving a minor hand injury. The incident was primarily due to the captain's failure to warn the cabin crew about the impending moderate turbulence, particularly considering the increased turbulence effects in the aft section of the aircraft. The flight crew descended through solid cirrus clouds, encountering light turbulence and using weather radar. Encountered a thunderstorm cell, leading to deviation and moderate turbulence. Cabin crew, assisting an ill passenger, were injured during the turbulence. Post-incident confusion at the gate hindered immediate communication with the cabin crew. The cabin crew sustained injuries, and the captain realized the need for improved communication regarding turbulence warnings and post-incident checks. Enhance communication with the cabin crew about upcoming turbulence and use the intercom to ensure their well-being after such events. The incident highlights the importance of timely warnings and effective communication to ensure the safety and well-being of the cabin crew during turbulent conditions.",health and medical issues

When the flight deck shuts down the aircraft while we are still deplaning passengers and leaves for their layover; it leaves the cabin crew in an unsafe position due to the inability for us to use the cabin inter phone or PA in the event of any type of emergency in the aft section of the aircraft. In essence; we have no way to communicate with the front of the aircraft other than use of the megaphone. In addition; the cabin temperature rises rapidly once the air flow is discontinued making it a health/safety issue for the 100 or more passengers still waiting to deplane.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft was shut down; on multiple occasions; prior to deplaning all the passengers.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant (Party1) and the Flight Crew/Ground Personnel (Party2) regarding the shutdown of a B737 aircraft during layovers. The Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft was shut down on multiple occasions before all passengers had deplaned, resulting in the cabin crew losing communication capabilities (interphone and PA systems), leaving them reliant on a megaphone. Additionally, the cabin temperature rose rapidly due to the cessation of airflow, posing a health and safety risk to passengers still on board. The Flight Attendant suggested that the aircraft should not be shut down until all passengers have deplaned to address these safety concerns.",health and medical issues

Subsequently the slide pack dislodged fell part way from door. I grabbed the door to stop further deployment and told agent to back away. I then called captain and told him of situation. He instructed me to get everyone away for safety and came out to assist. He took over my place holding the door and had station personnel call for maintenance. He calmly let passengers know what was happening and remained at door until slide pack was removed to a safe distance and we could deplane passengers.Background of the day and offered as an explanation and not as an excuse; for the fault lies with myself.Several things happened that day to not only distract my focus but also to degrade my physical condition and awareness which led to my subsequent failure.On [a flight] earlier that same day when responding to someone hitting their flight attendant call light repeatedly while I was seated I stood up from jump seat to see what was required. They had turned it off by then and when I went to sit back down in my jump seat it had returned to its spring loaded upright position and instead of sitting in my jump seat I fell to the floor. The rest of the day was filled with discomfort as a result. I tried to fill out an incident report immediately however I was made to understand from the company website that I would need to use an actual computer as the reports were not supported by my handheld device. Dwelling on that and actively trying to physically avoid my number three as he was not feeling well and I didn't want to come down with something as I was already starting to feel unwell. The last few days had included many days of long flight hours and between the physical and mental strain of that and the stress of starting to get sick; I initiated actions that led to the incident.Specifically at the time of the incident I initiated all call procedures to disarm doors and deplane passengers. The flight attendants 2; 3; and 4 all accomplished their disarming per policy. At this time I also realized that the carts needed sealing with blue liquor seals.My door however was still armed. At that point; my number 3 flight attendant pointed to my door and in an attempt to shake me from my non focused state firmly said; 'you need to disarm your door.' I acknowledged him; turned towards my door and immediately gave the thumbs up for the station agent to open door 1L even though it was in the armed position.Between all the issues fighting for my focus at that time; I did not personally use the appropriate disarming procedures including monitor and challenge on my door even after I had crosschecked door 1R.I obviously did not have my focus where it belonged. I was hurting; trying to keep from getting more sick and feeling the effects of fatigue after several long flight hour days. While all of these things are true; the door was opened and slide fell out because I incorrectly initiated the process.I understand the importance of monitor and challenge procedures and I let my pain; distraction and illness take away my focus. The reality of the situation and the danger I put the station agent in is a big reality check that I will not soon forget. My job; when opening or closing a door always involves the monitor and challenge procedures and I intent to always make sure to using them completely to always succeed in my job when opening and closing aircraft doors.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported that the entry door slide was not disarmed when customer service attempted to open the door.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and ground personnel (Party2) during aircraft operations. The flight attendant opened the 1L door of a 737 aircraft in the armed position after receiving a thumbs-up signal from the station agent. This caused the slide pack to dislodge and partially deploy. The flight attendant immediately grabbed the door to prevent further deployment, instructed the agent to step back, and informed the captain. The captain assumed control, ensuring passenger safety, communicating the situation to passengers, and coordinating with maintenance. The slide pack was eventually removed, and passengers were safely deplaned. The incident was attributed to the flight attendant's failure to follow proper disarm procedures, including the monitor and challenge protocol, due to physical and mental fatigue, discomfort, and distractions from prior incidents during the day. The flight attendant acknowledged the lapse in focus and expressed intent to adhere strictly to procedures in the future. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further complications.",health and medical issues

We were about 3.5 hours from our destination. The Chief Purser called the cockpit and advised me that we had an elderly passenger; flying with her granddaughter; experiencing some confusion. She advised me that the passenger has a history of dementia and that her granddaughter had also advised her of that Ms. X was experiencing some confusion and anxiety. She has some difficulty seeing (was told that she was somewhat blind but could see light and some shapes); in addition Ms. X didn't speak English. We found someone to interpret; but Ms. X was unresponsive; uncooperative and was unable to understand what was going on. I was flying; so I had the last break; so I (the Captain) went back to see what assistance I could offer. I found Ms. X agitated and not responding to verbal commands. I was advised that she wanted to open the door and get out; she kept telling the interpreter that she wanted to see her daughter 'right now' (the daughter was waiting for Ms. X to connect to another flight; and was going to pick her up). I observed her trying to go for the door; and she became somewhat combative; in addition she began to 'chant' out loud. I talked to the Doctor and Nurse who had offered to help and asked their advice. It was decided that we would let her stand in the aisle way and try and tire herself out (she refused any liquids or medication). I requested an F/A to remain at the door. I didn't want to force her to sit down; and I didn't want to have to restrain her; due to her frail stature and age. I had requested the two pilots in the cockpit to contact Dispatch and advise them of the situation; and our desire to have medical meet the airplane. I discussed the option of diverting with the Doctor and the Nurse; they thought that she could be managed; and that they would keep an eye on her. I elected to continue the flight. I ordered the cabin lights to be turned on in the hope that she would feel a little more secure. I returned to my seat and tried to resume my break. A few minutes later I was advised that she was becoming agitated and aggressive again. I returned to the cabin and after a discussion with the Doctor and Nurse; I ordered her to be put in an aisle with three seats so that the Nurse could sit on one side and the interpreter could sit on the other and keep her secure. It should be noted that by this time she had become a little more familiar with them and was responding somewhat to their voices. She did not want to sit down; so we had to hold her hands down while we physically put her in the seat. This was done with the help of myself; the Doctor; the Nurse; her granddaughter and another F/A. We got her into the seat and buckled her in; while the Nurse and Translator positioned themselves on either side of her. Ms. X calmed down; but did experience a few more episodes of agitation and aggressive behavior. I again questioned them of their ability to keep her calm. If the situation continued; or got worse; I was going to divert and get her off the airplane. They assured me that they could handle her; and there was no further incident for the rest of the trip. When we arrived; the Paramedics were standing by and had to restrain her to get her out of the jet. We thanked all who were involved; and told them how much we appreciated their assistance and consideration. I elected not to call for a Security level 1 or 2; after discussing it with the crew. Ms. X was clearly confused and suffering from Dementia; I did not feel she was a threat to the flight; only to herself. Her agitation and aggressiveness appeared to be due to her confusion and fear; I witnessed no malice or desire for violence. Because of her advance age and frail stature; I saw no real or immediate threat. The event was one of medical nature; and not a security threat.,,,,B777 Captain reported a passenger with dementia and poor eyesight experienced confusion and anxiety on an international oceanic flight.

Due to her confusion and anxiety, Ms. X became agitated and unresponsive, expressing a desire to exit the aircraft. The cabin crew, including an interpreter, attempted to assist her, but she remained uncooperative. The Captain intervened, consulted with a physician and nurse on board, and decided to let her stand in the aisle to calm down. When her agitation worsened, the crew helped her sit down with medical assistance, and she was restrained upon landing by paramedics.

He also was unable to see his assignment nor the flight plan on the iPad app; I proceeded to the aircraft to ascertain the flight attendant situation; as we still did not have our relief pilot; and briefed the customers and flight attendants and CSR's as to our progress; finally received release 4 and printed the package as the relief First Officer arrived; all went to the aircraft and proceeded to preflight and load; still big problems loading the flight plans; winds; etc.; plus we were still not showing as the pilots of record in ACARS; multiple calls to dispatch and the [duty manager] for help; finally pushed; but revised clearance from ATC came across and we loaded it; an entirely new route and track; push crew was unable for a reported tug or tow bar issue to push us to the spot ramp control wanted us; but ramp control said we would be fine; after disconnect and salute; I called dispatch to clarify what was going on with the route as we were indicating insufficient fuel; She determined that the re-route was the original release from earlier in the evening and refilled; meanwhile we were blocking the alley for multiple aircraft; by this time; with a messed up FMC route and release verification (we still weren't showing as the pilots of record in ACARS) I was resistant to start and move the aircraft and burn down our fuel until we at least had a valid flight plan that matched ours; dispatch's; and ATC; enduring repeated badgering by other pilots waiting for access to the alley and the ramp controller; we finally decided to start; do our checklists as best we could considering the conflicted information we had; and head for the box to figure things out; taxiing; and the resultant distracting multiple taxi plan changes was probably a mistake; as it only heightened the confusion; meanwhile; whenever we were stopped; I had multiple calls from the back by flight attendants who are very fatigued and not wanting to depart (they decided they wanted to proceed after all; citing fear of reprisals; as while they were obviously very; very tired; they were technically legal) while also juggling calls to the [duty manager]; Dispatch; ATC and ramp control; At this point; the flying first officer announced that he had had enough; and called fatigue- he felt exhausted and was making mistakes and was completely confused with the route and FMC (we all were- by this time; ATC had two flight plans on file and wondered which one we wanted). All this in our weakest circadian low. After a brief discussion we all agreed to return to thegate. Thanks to the supervisors who met us at the gate.

The Captain encountered difficulties declaring fit for duty and discrepancies in the flight plan, leading to further complications with the FMC and ACARS. Despite efforts to resolve these issues, communication breakdowns and unresolved technical problems exacerbated the situation. Crew fatigue reached a critical point, prompting the First Officer to call it off. Ultimately, the flight was canceled to ensure safety and compliance with regulations.

After engine start; FA called us to inform us a passenger was vomiting in the lavatory. We waited a few minutes; as we were behind traffic anyway and couldn't taxi. The Captain and I discussed returning to the gate; and decided if the passenger was still in the lav in 5 minutes; or if when they came out they were not feeling well; we'd return to the gate. After 2 minutes; the FA called and reported she was out and feeling better. We asked 'are you sure?' The FA said yes. We taxied; took off; and flew for an hour and 20 minutes without incident. At this time; they called to report our meals were ready. I asked about the ill passenger; and the FA told me there were 20-25 sick people in the back. Vomiting; diarrhea; etc. At this point; we knew we had an issue. We asked them for as much info as possible; if the people knew each other; stayed at the same resort; etc. It was then we learned people boarded the aircraft complaining of illness. This is the first time we heard any of this. I'm truly not trying to throw anyone under the bus; but it was frustrating to find out these details so late in the flight; where we are an hour from the nearest airport with few options. At this point; we requested direct [to destination] and tried to get a patch to MEDLINK. We were on the boundary of HF and VHF; so we never got a clear signal on the VHF frequency they gave us. The FAs came back that 3-4 passengers felt really sick; and the other 20 or so either felt off or had been sick in Puerto Plata. One had even been in the emergency room the night before in the Dominican Republic. Again; news to us. Most or all of the sick passengers stayed at the same resort. We got direct; were cleared visual [approach]; and parked offsite so the CDC could evaluate whether there was a bigger issue.

After receiving an initial report of a vomiting passenger, the crew briefly considered returning to the gate but proceeded after the passenger was reported feeling better. Approximately an hour and 20 minutes into the flight, the crew discovered that many passengers were unwell. With limited communication and options, they requested a direct flight to their destination and CDC evaluation. The flight was diverted, landed visually, and parked offsite for CDC evaluation.

She said something about a migraine and rode to the airport with her eyes closed. The ride was very long due to rush hour traffic. During the van ride; the other F/A and I were talking and both thought there was no way she could work. When we got to the airport the van driver pulled me aside and told me I needed to do something about her (both that she seemed sick and she smelled sick) the other F/A and I were able to pull the captain aside and share our concerns and the van drivers comments; even telling him that she was not fit to fly. We shared the same concerns with the lead F/A when we got to the airplane. To my knowledge; neither of them spoke to her; and we began to board. We were rushed during the boarding process; even closing the door with bags in the cabin that needed to be checked. After takeoff when the sick F/A came to the back; she went in the lavatory and proceeded to get loudly and violently ill. Myself and the other flight attendant were left to serve and clean up a full 321 by ourselves.I have had some time to think about this; and am extremely disappointed that I feel our concerns about the ability of a crew member to do their duties was virtually ignored. I know we were in an out station; and removing her from the trip would have caused great delays and customer inconvenience; however; that is exactly what should have happened. An ill crew member is often not a very good judge of their own ability and we have an obligation to look out for each other and act in the best interest of our coworkers and passengers. I do not feel I had the tools to do so. We go to great lengths to outline procedures for ill pax; etc. but those were not applied here. We must not fail at our primary duties in order to protect the operation. Without us doing our duties; there is no operation. We need to feel to feel more empowered to do what we know is right.,,,,A321 Flight Attendant reported another Flight Attendant was obviously ill; but worked the flight anyway. This put additional workload on the remaining flight attendants.,"The incident occurred on an A321 flight where a flight attendant, Party 1, arrived late, was not in uniform, and exhibited signs of illness, including a migraine and a strong odor. Despite concerns raised by the other flight attendant and crew about her inability to work, no action was taken to remove her from the flight. During the boarding process, the crew was rushed, and after takeoff, Party 1 became severely ill, vomiting in the cockpit, which increased the workload on the remaining crew. The failure to address the situation led to operational challenges and highlighted the need for crew empowerment to handle such incidents, ensuring both passenger safety and crew well-being are prioritized.",health and medical issues

As I was contemplating asking if he needed to use his concentrator during all phases of the flight; I checked my manifest and noticed he wasn't even listed as having an O2 concentrator. As I was about to ask him a question or two; the passenger in 13B asked me if his (12B) O2 bottle ran out; would we have O2 bottles for him to use on board. I almost chuckled as I said 'he's not using O2 from a bottle; it's an O2 concentrator; but we have no info about it even being on board.' She replied that he indeed was using an O2 bottle as he has lung cancer and only 25% use of one of his lungs. I must have had a very odd look on my face as I said 'but he can't bring his own O2 bottle on board an aircraft; totally not allowed!' 'How did you get past the TSA?' She said they discovered the bottle; took it; checked it out; and returned it saying it was okay. My comment was 'they what?' 'So; no one else was informed that you had this and intended to use it on the plane? Turn it off please; now.' I went and retrieved one of our Portable Oxygen Bottles (POBs) and asked the D flight attendant to tell the A flight attendant to notify the flight deck. The passenger in 13B was the girlfriend of the passenger in 12B. She also told me he has used his own POB on many other flights before. She didn't say which airline.Being the C flight attendant; I'm not allowed to be forward of the exit rows for boarding; nor would I leave my cabin area of responsibility prior to takeoff. After takeoff; I'm setting up my cart as the B and D flight attendants are [completing other service duties]. So; not sure how I could have done anything different due to my position. Had I been working a position where I would have seen Mr. [12 B] on what I would have assumed was an O2 concentrator; I would have looked at my manifest to see if he was listed as using one. I would have then asked him if he needed to use it during all phases of flight including takeoff and landing; where I may have asked to move him to a window seat so as not to block/hamper other passengers egress to the main aisle in an emergency. That exchange most likely would have brought about a discovery of an O2 bottle and not a concentrator.I think lesson #1 is never assume a darn thing! Many passengers are not aware they need to disclose plans to use an O2 concentrator and I have watched them come onboard only to discover they aren't listed on my manifest. I then have time to contact an agent to see if they are aware of it and it just hasn't showed up on my manifest yet. I strongly suggest all flight attendants be very aware of passengers using O2 and watch for the device when passengers are boarding; then verify we all know about it. None of that would have mattered in this instance as his O2 bottle was concealed in a small black oblong bag. Boarding an aircraft is a crazy busy time for all concerned. All the more reason to be alert then; as well as any time after takeoff; to things like a passengers using (what should only be) an O2 concentrator and checking to make sure they are listed in our manifest or the proper tag has been placed on it by our agents.,,,,Flight Attendant reported discovering a lung cancer patient inhaling oxygen from a personal bottle not listed on the manifest. The bottle was turned off and replaced with an onboard bottle.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a passenger in seat 12B, diagnosed with lung cancer, used a personal oxygen bottle not listed on the manifest. The flight attendant, initially unaware, was informed by the passenger's girlfriend that TSA had permitted the bottle. Upon realizing the bottle's presence, the flight attendant retrieved an onboard portable oxygen bottle, instructed the passenger to turn off his personal device, and notified the cockpit. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of verifying oxygen device usage and being vigilant during boarding to prevent similar occurrences. The result was the passenger switching to the provided onboard bottle.",health and medical issues

I immediately noticed [female passenger's] head was wrapped in surgical bandages and her face was very swollen.  Her face was so swollen; her eyes were slits. On the left side of her face was a lump about the size of an orange.  Out of concern; I greeted [her] and asked where she was sitting; my motivation being to keep an eye on her during the flight.  [Male companion] showed me his wife's ticket; 21E; an exit row seat.  I asked [female passenger] if she knew she was assigned to an exit row seat.  She did not respond and just stared at me with dull; listless eyes.  I thought she might be on some kind of pain medication as a result of her obvious medical condition.  I asked [her] if she was capable of opening an exit window and assisting in the event of an emergency.  She continued to stare blankly at me and not answer my questions.  [Male companion]; speaking for his wife; said 'of course she can!'  He told me that the gate agent assigned us these seats.  Purser witnessed [female passenger's] condition; my asking her emergency exit questions; [her] not responding and her husband responding for her.  When I told [male companion] we would need to relocate them to another economy plus seat; [he] indicated he was unwilling to have their seats changed.  At that point; [the Purser] went to find a CSR to handle the situation.The [passengers] took their seats at the exit row.  Boarding continued and my attention was soon diverted from boarding to a CSR speaking loudly to [the Purser] near me in the First Class galley.  He was challenging her judgement about [female passenger's] condition and he did not want to move the [passengers].  I offered CSR my assessment of [female passenger]; saying I believed she was not qualified or capable of assisting in an evacuation. I told him that she did not respond to my exit row verification questions and that I thought she might be on some kind of medication that would also inhibit her ability to assist. CSR was visibly not calm or controlled.  His voice was loud and he appeared to be taking our request to relocate the [passengers] out of the exit row personally.  [He] snapped back at me 'did you ask her if she was on medication?'  I replied the husband was insisting he and his wife not be moved and because the door was still open; it was not my responsibility to ask any passenger if they are on medication.  [CSR] left the plane saying he was calling his supervisor.  [Purser] went to the cockpit to inform the Captain about the problem.  The Captain supported our concern and put in his request that Customer Service reseat the [passengers]. The Captain was on the jet bridge; talking to the Customer Service supervisor and CSR. Another gate agent reseated the [passengers].  The door was closed and we took off.  Within minutes of wheels up and before the inflight announcements were made; we heard the call chime. I could see the light was near the [particular passengers] so I made my way toward the call light to where they were sitting.  [The female passenger] was unconscious; shaking and being held by her husband.  I went forward and immediately notified [Purser].  We had an emergency room doctor in 2A and he immediately responded.  [Purser] notified the cockpit and served as communicator while I assisted the doctor.  Another doctor and a surgical nurse were across the aisle from the [passengers] and they both assisted the emergency room doctor.  It was determined by the doctors that [the female passenger] had suffered a seizure and possibly a post-op blood clot to the brain or stroke.  The doctors agreed an emergency divert was necessary.  We landed in Airport ZZZ where [the female passenger] was removed by EMT.,,During boarding; I noticed a couple seated in the exit row at 21 E and F. The woman had a heavily bandaged head and her eyes did not seem to focus completely (as though she was on medication). They both had carry-on items and 2 large bed pillows at their feet; blocking access to the window exit. When I attempted to explain that the items had to be stowed; the man interrupted me and said; 'She can do it' apparently referring to her ability to open the window exit in an emergency. My flying partner indicated that they were being moved to other seats. I was very surprised to see that they had been seated in the emergency exit row to begin with and said the same to our purser; who had already brought the issue up with the CSR working the flight. As it turned out; the woman had a medical event during the flight and the plane was diverted to Airport ZZZ; where she was removed from the flight and taken to the hospital.,,Two flight attendants requested that passengers be relocated from exit row seating due to concern over the female passengers state of health. Customer Service was resistant but eventually reseated the passengers. Shortly after takeoff; the female passenger was reported to have become unconscious. A medical diversion took place where the passenger was removed from the flight.,"The incident originated from concerns raised by the flight attendant regarding a female passenger's medical condition, which included bandaged head injuries, facial swelling, and possible medication use. The passenger's husband insisted she could perform emergency exit duties, despite her unresponsive nature to relevant questions. The flight attendant sought to reseat the passenger from an exit row due to her medical state. The Customer Service Representative (CSR) initially resisted this request. After consultation with the purser and supervisor, the passengers were reseated. Post-takeoff, the female passenger experienced a medical emergency, leading to an in-flight call for medical assistance. An emergency room doctor and other medical personnel assessed her condition, diagnosed a possible seizure or clot, and recommended a diversion. The flight was diverted to Airport ZZZ, where the passenger was removed by EMTs and taken to the hospital. The flight resumed its journey after the incident was resolved.",health and medical issues

Flight attendant had been performing her normal duties. During cruise flight on our final leg of the day from we heard a knock on the flight deck door. First officer looked through the peephole and informed me a passenger was at the door. I rang the flight attendant call button and the passenger picked up the inter phone. He informed us that our flight attendant was sick and was being attended to by another passenger.  He stated that she needed medical attention. I asked him to identify any passengers in the cabin with medical training to assist in helping flight attendant. I asked him to answer the phone when I called back for more information. I declared an emergency with ATC and requested a diversion to [a nearby airport]. We were cleared direct. I notified our dispatcher via ACARS of our diversion and situation. I rang the flight attendant call button and the same passenger as before answered. I asked him if the flight attendant was conscious. He said yes. I asked him what was wrong with her. He said she has a terrible headache and she was weak. I told him we would be landing in 10 minutes and we were going to have paramedics meet the plane.First officer and I began preparations for landing. I made a passenger announcement with our diversion information and instructions to stow personal belongings; fasten seatbelts; and remain seated for landing.A couple minutes later the flight attendant called us on the inter phone. She informed me that she had a terrible headache but she believed she was able to continue the flight. I told her the decision to divert had already been made and that we would be landing in eight minutes. I asked her to remain seated for the rest of the flight.I contacted [airport operations] and gave them our ETA. We made a visual approach; landed; and taxied to the gate. Paramedics were standing by and assisted flight attendant off of the airplane. I made a PA; spoke with the station manager; and then went to check on flight attendant. The paramedics recommended a medical evaluation and that flight attendant was refusing further treatment. They had given her and she was using an oxygen mask.I asked flight attendant how she was feeling. She said she had a headache but it was better than before. I told her that it would be a good idea to follow the paramedic's advice. I told her we couldn't continue the flight and that I feared she may not be safe if she had an ongoing medical issue. She then agreed to go with the paramedics to the hospital for a medical evaluation.In the mean time operations had communicated a plan to accommodate our passengers to first officer. He briefed me and we coordinated deplaning the passengers with station operations. I spoke with a flight attendant supervisor; a hub coordinator; and our dispatcher over the phone. We then went to speak with the passengers who assisted flight attendant.We met the passengers [at their seats]; thanked them for their help; and asked them to tell us what happened.Although she spoke broken English; the conversation with the [first] passenger was conducted mostly in Spanish with first officer. I understood some of what the passenger said and asked first officer to translate the rest. During that conversation the passenger stated that flight attendant showed signs of discomfort before the flight both through her facial expressions and body language. During the flight the passenger saw flight attendant in the galley with a bag of ice on her head and she was crying. When the passenger offered to help; flight attendant stated she was dying. The passenger noticed she was weak and became very scared for flight attendant's life. The [first] passenger instructed the [second] passenger to contact the pilots.The flight attendant suffered a serious medical condition.,,,,When the Flight Attendant aboard an EMB-145 fell ill and incommunicado two passengers rose to the occasion managing to alert and contact the flight crew who diverted to a nearby airport where the flight attendant was met by EMT personnel and taken to the hospital for treatment.,"An EMB-145 flight attendant experienced a serious medical condition during the flight, exhibiting symptoms such as a severe headache and weakness.

Flight Crew reported to Maintenance a squeal in the cabin during Deadhead to ZZZ1. Line Maintenance arrived to investigate and requested Flight Crew to start engines with [Main Cabin] door shut. After listening in the cabin at normal pressure levels on the ground; Maintenance put aircraft pressurization system into manual mode and descended the cabin until reaching 3.0 psi and back to unpressurized; approximately 15 minutes. Crew experienced uncomfortable ear pressure but no other medical concerns. Maintenance tightened a connection in Pack-1 and Aircraft returned to service. In ZZZ; the following morning; Captain obtained a copy of the Maintenance procedures including the BOLD WARNING about non-essential personnel not being onboard. This pressurization took the flight crew to a cabin altitude below sea level; there is concern similar to a scuba dive. Pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable. Company Medical was called; but by this time it was 24 hours past the pressurization event. The flight attendant; who has a hearing impairment and wears hearing aids; reported being more plugged up than usual and was removed at Company Medical Doctor's request. The Flight Crew unaware pressurization to 3.0 psi was planned. Line Maintenance did not have copy of procedure with them. Flight Crew unaware of potential hazard due to no briefing from Maintenance personnel and no written copy of maintenance procedure. Ensure that when procedures are communicated from Maintenance Control to Line Maintenance; that warnings are transmitted. Provide written guidance on Flight Crew assisting Maintenance or provide adequate personnel to perform procedure without ANY assistance from Flight Crew.,Reporter stated the air conditioning packs on the EMB-145 are located in the wing root area under the cabin seats. The cabin pressure controller knob is extremely sensitive and controlling a rate of descent of 500 feet per minute is very difficult in the manual mode. The EICAS display indicated the cabin pressure had gone down to 1;500 feet during the ground pressurization leak check. What the actual pressure ended up being; he is not sure; but flying at altitude after that may not have been advisable as he learned later.,Crew was Deadheading in the cabin on an EMB-145 aircraft to ZZZ1 and heard a squeal sound when pilots added power. Upon landing captain informed Maintenance Control. Control contacted ZZZ1 contract mechanic to investigate a squeal sound in the aircraft cabin. Maintenance Control directed crew to start engines while contract mechanic and Maintenance Control investigated the squeal. Contract mechanic was on the phone with Maintenance Control. The mechanics believed the issue was a loose connection in the PACK systems. However; without the flight crew knowing; Maintenance Control directed contract mechanic to conduct an 'air check.'Crew was unaware of this procedure and not briefed prior. Contract mechanic did not have a checklist. Flight Attendant was onboard. Contract mechanic; under the direction of Maintenance Control; and without warning to the crew onboard; pressurized the cabin substantially below sea level using the manual mode pressurization system to achieve a 3.0 psi pressure differential. Crew and contract mechanic experienced uncomfortable ear pressures during the procedure and the procedure was stopped within 15 minutes. Contract mechanic tightened the PACK connections and under the direction of Maintenance Control the contract mechanic signed off his work. Crew did not report any medical conditions preventing the safe operation of the aircraft. Flight operated safely back to base; conducting flight back to ZZZ. This report is being submitted for the operation of two flights; ZZZ-ZZZ1-ZZZ; because the crew were on board an aircraft which was pressurized below sea level prior to these flights. The concern arises from the possibility that pressurizing the aircraft to a pressure below sea level may expose flight crews to injuries similar to those of scuba divers. Captain contacted Maintenance Controller X who stated that this procedure was not dangerous. Captain obtained the 'leak check' procedure from ZZZ Company Maintenance department and found the procedure was not what the crew witnessed. The crew did not have prior knowledge of the Medical Warning found on page one of the procedure. Captain contacted ZZZ Chief Pilot who did not know how to proceed but directed the captain to Company Medical. Captain called Company Medical whose Doctor concluded that further flights would be safe because 12-hours had elapsed from the exposure. However; Flight Attendant; who wears hearing aids was removed by Company Medical Doctor to evaluate ear conditions prior flying again.Crew was not briefed that Maintenance Control had directed contract mechanic to conduct a 'leak check.' Contract mechanic under the authority of Maintenance Control conducted the check without a visual checklist. This is not the first report captain has submitted highlighting the prevalence of Maintenance Control talking contract mechanics through a procedure via telephone. This practice is potentially dangerous especially if the WARNINGS in the procedures are not communicated to those persons inside an aircraft during these procedures. Company should issue written standards to the flight department outlining the approved procedures which would allow pilots and crew to assist contract mechanics with the servicing and maintaining of the aircraft fleet. These verbal procedures are potentially hazardous especially to flight crew because flight crew often operate in extreme environments and with limited time on the ground to acclimate or recover from exposures. Because the FAA relies largely on the science of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) for infection control procedures; then FAA should likely consult hyperbaric medical societies for procedures involving aircraft pressurization and the standards for medical screening of crew and passengers involved in these procedures and involved in inflight rapid depressurization events.,,A Contract Mechanic was directed by Maintenance Control to pressurize the cabin of an EMB-145 aircraft to below sea level in the manual mode. Flight crew and Flight Attendant were not made aware after being requested to start engines with the main cabin door closed. Uncomfortable ear pressure was experienced. Crew departed in the morning; but pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable due to scuba dive effect.,"The incident involved an EMB-145 aircraft operated by a flight crew from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and back. During the deadhead trip, the crew heard a squeal in the cabin and reported it to maintenance. Maintenance requested the crew to start engines with the cabin door closed and proceeded to manually pressurize the cabin to 3.0 psi without informing the crew. This resulted in uncomfortable ear pressure for the crew and the flight attendant, who has a hearing impairment, leading to her removal by a doctor. The root cause was the maintenance team's failure to brief the crew, lack of a checklist, and reliance on verbal procedures. The captain later discovered that the procedure followed wasn't the standard one, and this wasn't the first such incident, highlighting potential dangers of verbal communication in extreme environments. The proposed solutions include establishing written company procedures for maintenance and crew assistance, and consulting medical experts for safer pressurization standards. The outcome emphasized the need for clear communication and standardized procedures to prevent future incidents.",health and medical issues

Whenever any passenger requested any sort of assistance from medical to a snack we were providing it to them. Flight attendants were making attempt to inform our base supervisor and crew services of the situations taking place on the aircraft. XA:30Pilot informed Lead Flight Attendant (LFA) of diversion to a nearby airport. The landing was going to take place rather fast. At this time LFA informed the other flight attendants of the diversion. Pilot In Command (PIC) made the PA announcement that the flight will be landing in ZZZ due to unable to land at our filed destination due to weather. LFA followed up with a PA announcement indicating the diversion. Also; stated for flight attendants to begin preparing the cabin for arrival. XA:454 chimes - Flight attendants picked up remaining service items and LFA did final compliance walk for landing. XB:02 (Actual)LFA made the arrival announcement.XB:05Aircraft was parked on Tarmac. LFA began Tarmac record. LFA pulled up Tarmac Delay information in [the Ipad]. Passengers begin standing in the aisle stretching legs and standing in line for the 3 lavatories on board. XB:25 [A] Passenger's wife came forward to the galley and stated husband is feeling very nauseous. FA 3 provided his wife with ginger ale; water; trash bag and offered a snack. At this time she refused a snack for him. Then [FA 3] followed passengers to seat to assess.XB:32LFA advised PIC we were in need of our official block out time for delay record. Instead of the block out time PIC informed lead we do not have this time since we are sitting on an active Tarmac. Instead noted and gave the arrival time into the divert airport. XB:42 PIC made announcement we were expecting to depart ZZZ and head to ZZZ1 in about an 1 hour and fifteen minutes. This would give the crew an ETA into our original destination of XC:57. With this ETA given lead then discussed with Flight Deck (FD) the potential for a pour service to be needed. Flight attendants were advised against a pour and snack service to be conducted. XC:00Passengers came forward and stated she was a diabetic and insulin was under the plane. She said she was due for it in about an hour. If we could give her some M&M's and water she would be fine until the delay is completed. Even though this was a medical related issue we did not have to ask for a doctor. Flight deck was notified by LFA. From XB:02 till XC:00 all doors on the aircraft were armed during the tarmac delay! XC:06 The flight deck made an announcement that the aircraft would be taxing to a different fueling area. LFA made prior to aircraft movement announcement minus electronic devices to ensure compliance before saying it was safe to move aircraft. LFA walked the cabin to ensure compliance. FA 2 and 4 were seated in jump seat with aft barrier strap up. FA 2 stated aft cabin secure. A single chime [to] flight deck to signal cabin was ready for movement. Flight deck then called and asked if we were ready for movement. LFA stated to captain 'this is why I single chimed you'.XC:20 Aircraft arrived at fueling area. Captain asked if doors were armed if so they needed to be disarmed because we were about to fuel. LFA made the announcement FA prepare doors for arrival.XC:23 [FA 3] who injured himself earlier on the deicing fluid in the cabin while stowing his baggage before departure FA 2 saw him limping. FA 2 called forward to ask if there was [a] bandage in the First aid kit. LFA looked at the items in our First Aid kit and we did not have [a] bandage. FA 2 came forward to get ice for the customer. XC:27[Another] passenger who had Claustrophobia came forward to the bulk head just looking for space away from other passengers and crew members. Crew members remembered this passenger from the previous week flight. Atthis point we noticed [passenger] very hot; sweaty and in a panic. She was saying can I just get air! She then began vomiting in the trash bag in the galley. LFA made the announcement of do we have any doctors or nurses on board and if so can you ring your FA call button. At this time LFA also notified the flight deck of the situation and we were filling out a cabin report. While the nurse who was chosen by [flight crew] as our medical personnel from mid cabin to come forward. LFA stayed with the passenger ensuring her everything was going to be ok and we were working with the FD for passengers to get off the aircraft.XC:29 PIC headed to aft of the aircraft to do a walk around. PIC asked flight attendants 2 and 4 to hold and watch the tail cone door exit. At this time he went down the steps the FA had deemed to be 'hazardous'.XC:31First Officer (FO) called [FA] into the FD after the cabin report had been given to them. With the cabin report [medical services] was contacted. Once [medical services] was contacted FO gave [FA] his personal cell phone to have the conversation with [medical services]. [Medical services] advised the passenger to begin doing breathing exercises. [Medical services] wanted the use of [oxygen]. [A FA] got the [oxygen] uncovered the mask and the customer felt like it would make her become more claustrophobic. On the cabin report the only medication the passenger stated she had taken was Gravol. At the time I did not know what Gravol was. Passenger said it was motion sickness medicine. When I was writing this report I researched what this drug is. According to [website] Gravol is a new synthetic drug. It is highly addictive and makes users dangerously paranoid; to the point of suicide. It also causes paranoia; kidney failure; hallucination. During the conversation with [medical services] I initiated a crew to crew call with [medical services]. During this short called I asked her to come forward and help with the passenger. [Medical services] at this time stated that the only medicine in our Medical kit which could be administered to the passengers was Benadryl. Passengers refused the Benadryl as well and stated the Gravol should work. Passenger asked if she could sit in a seat in the bulkhead. One of the passengers in [bulkhead seat] heard this comment be made and was willing to move to [passengers] seat. [passenger] thanked the guy in [bulkhead] for doing this for us. [Passenger] calmed down once this decision was made. XC:40 FA 4 stated beverage and snack service as requested was needed for the cabin. Lead had lost track of time during the medicals and everything else; which was taking place in the cabin. Lead notified FD pour service was beginning. XC:41 FA immediately began pour service. We used the plastic bins inside the carts lined them up with cups and started pouring water into them. During this pour service we ran out of water on the carts and crew water. The only water we had left was the water bottles the crew had already drank out of. This service was completed by the 120 minute mark of the delay. XD:19Lead notified Captain we were right at the 3 hour mark of the delay. Passengers even after the service began getting upset. LFA notified flight deck the passengers were beginning to get upset. During the Tarmac delay instead of using the Interphone system to communicate with lead. The flight deck was just opening the door to have communication. LFA ask flight deck if we can go to normal procedures to open the door due how the passengers were being. At this time LFA notified captain that we are getting close to that 3 hour mark of the delay. Asked captain to make another announcement. XD:21Captain advised lead we were about to taxi to gate. FA prepare doors for departure announcement was made. Aircraft was prepared for taxi to the gate. FA did compliance check.XD:27 Announcement was made to prepare doors for arrival. Captain notified FA that the aft stairs would be used for deplaning. FA 2 notified lead the aft stairs were not safe to deplane off of due to the slick liquid (De icing liquid) on the stairs. LFA notified Crew services we did not feel it was safe. They advised us that passengers should take all belongings because there was a chance the plane was going to get Remain Overnight (RON) for the night in the divert airport.XE:30 Captain advised to deplane from the aft stairs even though FA advised against it. As soon as this announcement was made passengers began deplaning prior to LFA finishing her conversation with her supervisor. Once off the phone LFA advised passengers to take all carry on luggage with them down the back stairs of the aircraft and use caution exiting. During the deplaning process [ill passenger's] bag was taken in. LFA asked FD if she could exit aircraft to retrieve her bag. They told LFA to have her contact our supervisor. During the time frame of XE:50 and XG:45[Ill passengers] exited the aircraft not long after the passengers did to deplane. When [medical services] got back onto the plane they stated the passengers are in the terminal area and no one is giving them any updates. They just wanted the pilots or some airline employee to give some updates! XG:45 Began boarding again up the tail cone stairs; which was contaminated with both snow and the deicing fluid. FD asked LFA if we were ok with doing this. After discussion with the crew we decided since they already deplaned off these stairs. It's not safe but [might] as well board and get to our filed destination! Now while boarding the water from snow melting in combination with the deicing fluid made more of the aisle way slick. Just like it was in the departure airport. The flight attendants tried to [mitigate] any risk while boarding and LFA made boarding announcements like normal. While boarding a gentleman near the front of the aircraft stated his name was not on the manifest the gate agent was using. LFA notified flight deck. LFA told the flight deck this could be seen as a security issue. PIC stated a gate agent must tell the flight deck no security issues prior to pushing back. After it appeared boarding was complete FA 2 completed a count when I read the verification announcement. FA's noted we were missing 8 people. This was verified by the gate agent giving FA 2 the names of the individuals to read on the PA. The FA 2 told passengers to ring their FA call buttons if they were on board. FA 4 and 3 re briefed exit rows. PIC handed the paper work through the window of the aircraft to a gate agent. LFA stated 'Cabin Secure!; Clear to Close?' I single chimed FD indicating we were ready for push back. FA 3 asked lead if she was ok with doing the safety demo and she would read the safety demo. I said yes and I did the safety demo in the cabin. After the safety demo I walked down the aisle to ensure compliance again. Once I got back informed passengers we would be dimming the cabin lights for departure and read the deicing announcement. XH:15Finally; we landed in our originally filed destination. Arrival announcement was made and we apologized for the delay. Also; stated use caution when exiting the aircraft and getting carry on luggage out of the over head bins. LFA made the FA prepare doors for arrival announcement was made. LFA did her cabin sweep of any left items and cross checked all doors were not armed.XH:58 Crew called crew services to find out information about ride to hotel; what hotel we are staying in and what our show time is for the next day. Finally got the [hotel] our crew was dead tired. We all just wanted to check in and put our heads on a pillow. The day had used every ounce of energy we had. Once I walked up stairs to my room the hall way smelled as if smoking had been taking place. It didn't smell like cigarettes to me. Being in aviation I wasn't ok with the smell I was smelling just in case I was to get drug tested. I exited the room o,,,,A MD-80 Flight Attendant described crew and passenger behavior following a weather related diversion.

Later; the flight re-boarded for its original destination.,"The incident involved a weather-related diversion of an MD-80 flight, causing a three-hour ground delay. During the delay, flight attendants managed medical situations, including a passenger experiencing nausea and a claustrophobic episode, while also addressing passenger unrest. Despite challenges with cabin service and communication, the crew eventually re-boarded the aircraft and proceeded to the original destination, ensuring a safe arrival. The flight attendants coordinated with ground staff for hotel arrangements, concluding a taxing day with fatigue.",health and medical issues

On the flight I smelled the chemicals. Once in our destination when they emptied [the] trash; I could smell it even more because they drench the trash cans with the chemicals. During boarding I got dizzy and my vision became blurred. I talked to another flight attendant and told her. I drank some water and sat down for a minute and ate some pretzels. I became even more nauseated and started to have dry heaves and eventually vomited once in-flight. I notified my Domicile in-flight and Supervisor. I notified union and was told this is a problem and they have tried to stop it for awhile now. I am still nauseated and vomiting and dizzy with blurred vision.They are using cleaning chemicals in the oven and on galley floors and in the galleys. STOP USING THE CLEANER IN THE OVENS ESPECIALLY!

He could not readily identify the odor but said at times it resembled dirty socks.,,,An A319 Lead Flight Attendant became ill from an unknown substance during preflight and subsequently in-flight was nauseous and had blurred vision. Two weeks after the event; he is still off work with symptoms.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who experienced illness after exposure to cleaning chemicals with strong fumes used by ground personnel. The flight attendant encountered the odor during preflight and when emptying trash, leading to dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, dry heaves, and vomiting. Despite measures like drinking water and resting, symptoms persisted, prompting notifications to the domicile, supervisor, and union. The union noted previous attempts to halt the practice, and the flight attendant remained off work two weeks later.

When I answered I received a very loud and frantic voice repeating this 'XXXX; XXXX; we must land immediately.' I tried to gain more information to no avail. I declared an emergency and asked for a return to the airport. When asked what the nature of the emergency was; I stated that is was unclear; however; it could be a fire type of situation. During the 180 degree turn back we received a second chime and got the same verbiage from the flight attendants. 'XXXX; XXXX; we must land immediately.' Soon thereafter I took the control of the airplane and radios and asked the First Officer to get more information from the back. We eventually found out that is was an ill passenger who was having a heart attack and CPR was being administered. I then stated to ATC what type of emergency we had and entered a downwind for the landing runway.The phrase 'XXXX' is mentioned one time in our operations manual. It is a Flight Attendant to Flight Attendant reference only. Simple English; with details; need to be used when describing a situation in the cabin of the airplane. Due to the severity of the ill passenger (heart attack; no pulse; no breathing and CPR being done) the flight attendants were under a lot of stress. They performed very well and I would like to acknowledge they probably saved this mans life! GREAT JOB! However; I feel there needs to be much more awareness of the fact that we are not privy to or trained in some of their references; acronyms etc. My perception of what was maybe a fire or other [question of airworthiness] type of situation; even though for a very short time; is very concerning due to the [lack of specificity] from the flight attendants.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger had a heart attack shortly after takeoff; an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.  Captain stated the flight attendants were utilizing unique to the flight attendant group language to describe the situation which resulted in an inaccurate assessment of the needs between the flight crew and ATC.,"The incident occurred shortly after takeoff when a flight attendant used an internal code (""XXXX"") to signal an emergency to the flight crew. The flight crew, unfamiliar with this code, perceived it as a serious situation such as a fire, leading them to declare an emergency and return to the departure airport. Upon landing, it was discovered that the emergency involved a passenger experiencing a heart attack, with flight attendants administering CPR. The flight crew praised the attendants' quick response but highlighted the confusion caused by the internal jargon. To prevent future misunderstandings, it was proposed to enhance training and awareness regarding the use of such codes among all crew members.",health and medical issues

I advised Commercial radio and a discrete HF frequency was arranged and the patch was made. An on board ER nurse attended the passenger; made evaluations; provided treatment; and talked directly to Medlink. Medlink advised that we could continue and to provide O2 as needed. The Flight Attendant advised that they were using the Therapeutic O2 bottle. The Flight Attendant later advised us when the therapeutic bottle reached 250 PSI and a decompression bottle was used. As we still had several hours of flying; we discussed O2 use; and operational restrictions regarding depletion of O2 bottles. The First Officer and I discussed that the safest course of action; regardless of O2 quantities; would be to remain at altitude. I advised the First Officer that I was exercising Captains Emergency Authority in the event any of those bottles went below the prescribed volumes in order to remain at altitude. I discussed an O2 use plan with the Flight Attendant. We discussed using one decompression bottle to 1;500 PSI; then switch to the other decompression bottle; and use it until depleted. Shortly afterwards; she advised me that the first decompression bottle was at 1;250 PSI. I told her to switch to decompression bottle two; use it to 1;500 PSI; then use decompression bottle one; and deplete it. My thought was to ensure the Flight Attendant's maintained full capabilities in their mobility bottles. Shortly after this discussion; the  Flight Attendant advised that they could use their mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. With this information we revised our plan to include the mobility bottles as long as they ensured the mobility bottles did not go below 1;000 PSI. ACARS messages were sent to Dispatch advising them of the O2 usage and the volume levels of the bottles. After the second decompression bottle was used to 1;500 PSI; two mobility bottles were depleted to 1;000 PSI and a third was being used as we began our descent. Upon landing we were met by medics and the passenger was transported to medical facilities. Once we were deplaned I discussed O2 bottle usage with the Flight Attendants to ensure I fully understood the amount used. I discovered that the therapeutic bottle was depleted to 250 PSI; the number one decompression bottle to 250 PSI; number two to 1;500 PSI; and two mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. Mechanics boarded the aircraft; were advised and we discussed the write ups of the bottles as well as the EMK. [We were in a] high workload environment in ETOPS airspace. Medlink event happened near a waypoint with need to arrange for Medlink; plot; and report waypoints; monitor Medlink transmissions via HF; and derive an O2 use plan with Flight Attendant's that would be sufficient for a number of hours. There appeared to be confusion between the naming conventions of each type of bottle and the amount we could use before encountering altitude restrictions. I thought that the Flight Attendant was trading the names of the therapeutic bottle and the decompression bottle. Once on the ground I discovered that both the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle were depleted to 250 PSI.,,,,An  Air Carrier flight crew depleted their cabin oxygen bottles below acceptable limits while treating a passenger who became ill near the ETP. There was confusion with naming conventions of the bottles and operational restrictions.,"The incident involved a flight crew and a flight attendant responding to a passenger illness requiring medical attention during a flight in ETOPS airspace. The flight attendant initially requested Medlink assistance, and the crew arranged for a discrete HF frequency to facilitate communication. An onboard emergency room nurse evaluated the passenger, and Medlink advised continuing the flight while providing oxygen as needed. The flight attendant used a therapeutic oxygen bottle, later switching to decompression bottles and mobility bottles as the flight progressed. Despite efforts to manage oxygen levels, confusion arose regarding the naming conventions and operational restrictions of the oxygen bottles. As a result, some bottles were depleted below prescribed limits. Upon landing, the crew reviewed the oxygen usage and discovered discrepancies in the bottle levels, including the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle being depleted to 250 PSI. Mechanics were boarded to address the oxygen bottle write-ups and ensure compliance with safety standards. Post-incident, the crew discussed the oxygen bottle usage to clarify naming conventions and prevent future operational issues.",health and medical issues

Approx 5 min later First Officer received a call from the cabin that the passenger passed out in the Flight Attendant's arms and that they were searching for medical professional on board.  Before the First Officer was able to get any additional information the Flight Attendant that called hung up.  The First Officer briefed me on the current situation. I instructed him to prepare for a possible diversion.  I got the ops freq for him and we set the FMS for the diversion. I then took over ATC comm and instructed the First Officer to get more information from the Flight Attendants on the age/sex of passenger name or seat assignment etc in case we needed to make a medical phone patch call. While he was talking to the Flight Attendant I informed ATC of our situation and the possibility of diverting for an unknown medical situation with a passenger that has passed out in the cabin.  The First Officer got in touch with one of the Flight Attendant and received some basic information that the passenger was female; non English speaking; vomiting and abdominal pains with two RN's evaluating her. The Flight Attendant then hung up on the First Officer again.  The First Officer briefed me on the information he received and informed me that in his opinion that both Flight Attendants were in a panic. The First Officer and I discussed the situation and I instructed him that we were 45 min from landing in ZZZ2 or 10 min from ZZZ.  We both agreed we needed more info from the Flight Attendants and RN before beginning our diversion.  I received instruction from ATC to descend to FL320 and switch to another ATC controller.  I checked in with that ATC controller and advised him of the situation of a possible diversion to ZZZ after we received additional information from the cabin on the condition of the passenger. During my conversation with ATC I heard the First Officer inform the Flight Attendant that she needed to ask the RNs for more information on the condition of the passenger; needed a seat assignment at least; and to tell the RN's that we needed a decision whether to continue to ZZZ2 that will take 40 min or divert to ZZZ that will take 10 min. When the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant I informed him of our decent to FL 320 and switched to another center freq.  We again discussed the situation with the Flight Attendant and finished preparations for diversion to ZZZ.  First Officer got ATIS and we set up for landing on RWY 23 in ZZZ.  First Officer then received a call from the Flight Attendant with seat assignment of passenger and that the RN's agreed that it would be best to divert to ZZZ.  When I heard that on the Interphone I informed ATC of or need to divert to ZZZ for a medical emergency. ATC gave  us a left descending turn to direct ZZZ. I informed ATC that we wanted paramedics; ambulance to meet the Aircraft for a female passenger in her mid 30's with abdominal pains and vomiting. After the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant. I brief him of our ATC instructions; asked him to call the company and instruct them that we will be diverting to ZZZ for a medical emergency and to pass on the information to our dispatcher and that we will call him on the ground in ZZZ.  We then completed all checklist and when we contacted ZZZ Approach Control were given straight in to Rwy XX.  We landed 10 min after beginning our descent on Rwy XX and in the Gate; 2 min after landing.  Paramedics took the passenger off the plane and she was transported to a local hospital.  The First Officer suggested that he talk to the Flight Attendant's on the situation to evaluate whether we should continue the flight to ZZZ2 with them.  I agreed.  (First Officer is a certified paramedic) I contacted dispatch and gave him all the information I had and while I was on the phone with him I was handed thepassenger boarding stub with the passenger's name and passed it onto dispatch.  After I finished my call with Dispatch a Flight Attendant came up to the cockpit. I asked her if there was anything used as far as emergency equip the passenger. She informed me that just the stethoscope and blood pressure cuff out of the EEMK [Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit] were used and replaced into the kit.  The First Officer returned to the cockpit and informed me that he talked to both the Flight Attendants and they were more relaxed and he felt that they were capable to continue the flight to ZZZ2 and back to ZZZ.  A few min later Flight Attendant 1 brought up one of the Flight Attendant O2 bottles and informed me that they had to give the passenger O2 and that the bottle pressure was below 1500 psi. I was a little disgusted and informed her that it needed to be replaced or serviced before we can leave ZZZ. I told her that I needed to know all the equipment that was used for this passenger; and should have be told of this when I asked the first time. (Note at this time the paramedics had already removed the passenger and we had been on the ground for about 15 min.) I called Maintenance Control about the O2 bottle and later discussed swapping the O2 bottle with the other CRJ9 that was overnighting.  Contract Maintenance did show up at the aircraft and serviced the O2 bottle. After contract Maintenance had finished the servicing of the O2 bottle and took the maintenance logbook to sign off the writeup the first officer and I prepared the aircraft for departure.  The next two flights were uneventful.  After returning back to ZZZ for the overnight I was performing my shutdown checklist when the Flight Attendant presented me the inventory checklist for the EEMK [Emergency Medical Kit] and First Aid Kit.  I again was disgusted.  The EEMK showed that the all items were in the EEMK but she had checked that it was incomplete and serviceable. One of the First Aid Kits was used and the latex gloves were used and the kit was incomplete. I informed her that this inventory should have been completed before we left ZZZ for ZZZ2 and I should have been informed when I asked her if any emergency equipment was used of the O2 bottle and the latex gloves were used.  I then called Maintenance Control to defer the First Aid Kit and after discussing the EEMK with him he decided to defer both the EEMK and the First Aid Kit that were used.  I left the Aircraft at XA:30 local time.,,,,A CRJ diverted to a nearby airport in response to a passenger medical emergency.  The Captain expressed some concern about the professionalism of the Cabin Attendants' familiarity with the administrative aspects of the aircraft emergency equipment.,"The incident involved a CRJ aircraft diverting to a nearby airport due to a female passenger experiencing a medical emergency, including vomiting and abdominal pains. The flight crew received initial reports from the cabin about the passenger's condition, followed by a request for medical assistance. The cabin crew's communication was described as panicked, with incomplete information provided during initial contacts. The flight crew prepared for the diversion, informed air traffic control (ATC), and requested emergency services at the diversion airport. The aircraft landed at ZZZ, where paramedics transported the passenger to a hospital. Following the landing, the flight crew discovered that emergency oxygen equipment had been used and was not properly serviced. The Captain expressed concern over the cabin crew's handling of the situation and their communication regarding the use of emergency equipment. Maintenance was called to service the oxygen bottle and defer the First Aid Kit, which had been used during the incident. The flight crew also reviewed the inventory of the Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit (EEMK) and found discrepancies in its contents. The flight resumed to its final destination, with no further issues reported during the remainder of the journey. The incident highlighted concerns about the cabin crew's familiarity with administrative procedures related to emergency equipment usage and their communication during critical situations.",health and medical issues

We cancelled the push and discovered the passenger had self-reported having the flu and being very ill. I made the decision to remove the Passenger and coordinated with customer service and Dispatch.   After landing; mid galley Flight Attendant reported that when she went to disarm door; she realized she had never re-armed the door after passenger removal. Flight Attendant filling out report. According to all (including mother and daughter of passenger who was removed); the passenger was visibly 'not well' by all accounts.  She never should have been allowed to board the airplane; particularly with all of the information available on influenza and public health risks. The distraction to the Flight Attendant caused by the return of the jetway and removal of the passenger caused a departure with door 2L unarmed. The increase in risk of not being able to get off the airplane in the event of an evacuation could have been avoided by a quick screening of the passengers boarding our airplanes.,,,,A Flight Attendant realized after arrival she had not armed a door because of distractions related to removing an ill passenger at departure time.,"An incident occurred during a flight involving a sick passenger with the flu. After receiving pushback clearance, the Ground Personnel were informed about the passenger's condition. The passenger was visibly unwell and reported having the flu, leading to the decision to remove them from the flight. This decision was coordinated with customer service and Dispatch. Upon landing, the Flight Attendant discovered that she had failed to re-arm door 2L due to distractions caused by the passenger removal process. This oversight posed a risk in the event of an evacuation. The incident highlighted the potential consequences of not adequately screening passengers for health risks, particularly concerning contagious illnesses like influenza.

The biohazard guys came on and found that a young boy had a temperature of 38.7; 38 being normal. They decided to quarantine him; his row; the rows in front and back of him; and something like 6 flight attendants; who had served him. One of them told a language speaker that a doctor was coming and would check him on board.  After about 20 minutes; the station manager finally showed up and said that to protect their departure on the 13th; the Chinese authorities would accept just one Flight Attendant. She didn't want to speak to me; and tried to ignore me; but I got involved in the conversation and asked where the doctor was; since this boy was only a fraction of a degree above normal; which may be normal for him. She didn't have a clue; and suddenly didn't seem to understand English anymore.  The purser and I asked her how they were going to determine which Flight Attendant would be quarantined. She said we should choose. We both said we would not do that; that we had no right to order someone to go into quarantine. She said then she would choose. When I asked her what she would do when that person refused; she again didn't understand English. I guess she's not used to people not obeying her.  Finally; the Purser said he would stay. I applaud him for doing that; but what makes this even more bizarre is that he never came into contact with the boy. I asked that station manager why not just send a customer service agent to go with the quarantined people; since they are local and speak the language. She didn't seem to understand my question...again.  Now here's the safety issue:  One of our crew members; who was completely healthy; was forced to go to a non-western hotel; where sick people were being held in quarantine; and given no bottled water (only purification tablets to use with tap water). What if he now gets sick?,,,,An air carrier Captain reported a verbal clash between bio-hazard personnel in ZSPD and flight attendants who had been exposed to a young man who was being quarantined due to the possibility he may have an infectious disease.,"The incident occurred at ZSPD when a young boy with a temperature of 38.7°C was quarantined, along with his row and six flight attendants who had served him. Biohazard personnel, led by a station manager, enforced these measures. The manager initially stated that only one flight attendant could depart, causing a conflict with the flight crew. The crew refused to select someone for quarantine, leading the manager to decide. The purser volunteered to stay, despite not being in contact with the boy. The Captain questioned why a customer service agent couldn't accompany the quarantined individuals, but the manager didn't respond. A safety concern arose as a healthy crew member was sent to a hotel with sick individuals, provided only with purification tablets and tap water. The purser's decision to stay and the Captain's suggestion for customer service involvement highlighted the need for improved quarantine protocols.",health and medical issues
850257,Aircraft X,General Seating Area,Air Carrier,Flight Attendant (On Duty),,,,Communication Breakdown; Confusion; Time Pressure,Party1 Flight Attendant; Party2 Ground Personnel; Party2 Other,850257,,,,,,,,,,,,Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Illness / Injury,,Y,Person Flight Attendant; Person Gate Agent / CSR,Aircraft In Service At Gate,,Company Policy; Procedure; Human Factors,Human Factors,I was aft Purser for this overseas flight and when boarding the aircraft I saw 2 oxygen tanks in the overhead and 2 more tanks on the opposite side. Spoke to the Purser about this because there had been no information for passenger on oxygen on our briefing sheet. Later a passenger service representative boarded; letting us know that; indeed; we would have a passenger on oxygen. Fortunately; the agent had seen the passenger in the boarding area and saw that the passenger would not be using a nasal cannula but a trachea cannula instead. Everything on the aircraft had been incorrectly set up for a nasal cannula.  The agent redid the hoses and explained how to change the tanks.  The passenger was with his family and a paramedic in the boarding area but the paramedic was not allowed to board per a TSA officer even though the Captain had allowed it.  So; five minutes before departure the passenger is hastily boarded; along with his wife and 2 daughters who are traveling with him. I am given no additional/further medical information and am trying to communicate with people who speak limited English. One of the daughters questions me if the flight goes all the way to Vietnam. I tell her the flight number does but that everyone needs to deplane in VHHH. She becomes worried and says her father needs to stay on the oxygen and that they had been told that they wouldn't have to deplane. She makes a quick phone call and I speak to the Doctor. She is concerned about the VHHH stop because they had NOT been told about this. I assured them that they would have oxygen in VHHH and that everything was already taken care of because the computer booking would have alerted someone that this wasn't a nonstop flight. The doors were already closed at this time so I told the daughter that we would follow through and confirm with VHHH later on during the flight. I spoke with the Purser about this and we both felt it was important to follow up with VHHH because everything else related to our passenger had been very unorganized and mismanaged. Luckily; we had a Flight Attendant that spoke Vietnamese.  I asked her to speak to the family after takeoff and reassure them that the oxygen would have already been prearranged in VHHH.  Later; when the Vietnamese literate Flight Attendant was on her break; our passenger needed to use the bathroom.  I tried to communicate with the family to see how long he could be without oxygen and I couldn't really get a straight answer because of the language barrier. I erred on the side of caution and we strapped a portable oxygen bottle around the daughter who was assisting her father to the bathroom. The Purser had communicated to the cockpit the need for verification that we would have oxygen for the passenger in VHHH. Eventually; the cockpit received a message that the passenger had been advised in their PNR that there would be no oxygen in VHHH!!!!! And if they need it; it would be $250 USD. The Vietnamese speaker spoke to the family and they became a bit upset because here we are getting close to landing and we are making last minute arrangements for oxygen. Upon landing someone comes down the aisle with an aisle wheel chair and no oxygen. I had to forcefully let them know our passenger could not be moved without oxygen. The Purser; myself and a few of the economy flight attendants stayed on board for 40 minutes with the passenger and his family while company customer service representatives explained to the family that the price of the oxygen would be around $500 USD!!!!! This was due to the cost of a Doctor or Nurse needing to be there and there was a minimum charge for a set number of hours. The family became very distressed. The father was on his deathbed and this was his last flight so he could die in Vietnam and they had been given wrong information. It was devastating for us to see how poorly this family had been treated by our Company. More importantly; it was dangerous that someone didn't follow throughproperly. This family was basically shoved on the airplane without proper medical information ever being gathered and placed in his computer record and communicated to the crew.  Subsequently; the paramedic should have been allowed to board.  By to let the paramedic board; important medical information was not able to be conveyed to the crew due to the language barrier.,,,,A Purser relates her concerns about the services provided a passenger traveling with special medical needs.,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",health and medical issues

I continued to perform my duties to the best of my abilities during boarding and takeoff. After the boarding door was closed I was asked by the flight crew if I was alright. I told them I didn't know but I thought I would be okay & able to perform my duties. After the safety demo was done; I went to the lavatory where I dealt with vomiting & diarrhea. I was experiencing unbearable stomach cramps also. I had to go to the lav at least every 5 or so minutes. I got a call from the captain and was asked how I was doing. I told him I wasn't doing well at all and wouldn't be able to do an inflight service. I was asked if we needed to make an emergency landing. I told him I thought I could at least make it to our destination. After that phone call; I had to go back to the lav. At that point in time I was very weak & dizzy and couldn't make it back up to my jumpseat. So I retreated to the nearest seat. I left my jumpseat out the entire flight to create some sort of barrier between the cabin and the flight deck. A passenger came up to me and told me he was a former EMT & wanted to take my vital signs. He said I wasn't in the best shape but I would be okay. I asked him to call the flight deck and let them know what was going on with me. He then returned and told me we were about 30 minutes out from our destination and we would be landing soon. Once we landed; EMTs boarded the aircraft and assisted me into the terminal via wheelchair. My vital signs were taken and I told them the symptoms of how I was feeling. They told me it sounded like I had food poisoning and there wasn't much they or a hospital could do for me. They advised against going to the hospital. I was contacted by my manager and crew scheduling. I was told I was taken off my trip and my manager had me go to the airport clinic to be evaluated. The doctor at the clinic diagnosed me with food poisoning and told me not to fly anywhere that night or the next morning. He also said there was nothing he could prescribe me and that the illness would have to run its course. The next time I am ill to the point of not being able to perform my duties and I know well ahead of time I will definitely call crew scheduling and my manager and let them know immediately. I will also get to some sort of urgent care facility as quickly as possible. I should have called as soon as I started showing signs of illness. I understand also that it is a major problem with me being the only flight attendant on duty and not being able to be in the proper state of mind and body to effectively perform my duties.,,Flight Attendant got progressively sicker during flight to the point of a passenger needing to help fill in for her duties. I briefed the First Officer on the situation and he had heard some of it. I said we needed to find in the FOM/POM reference to flight attendant incapacitation. I could find no reference in POM index for flight attendant or incapacitation. First Officer eventually found it.I told her if she was not feeling well or felt worse to brief a passenger on the use of the interphone and have them contact the flight deck. ... with approximately 50 minutes left in the flight at FL340 I received an interphone call from the cabin from a passenger on board saying the flight attendant was ill. He identified himself as a pilot and EMT. I asked the status of our Flight Attendant and he said she was conscious with a good pulse and good breathing and aside from being sick to the stomach had good vitals.I briefed the passenger initially on the interphone use and if a chime was heard pick up the phone and if her condition changed to call us ... At some point I went in the back and briefed the EMT that if he believed the flight attendant could not adequate perform her duties to relocate the her to a passenger seat and that he needed to sit in the FA jumpseat per FOM 'Flight Attendant Incapacitation' procedures. He accepted and I briefed him on opening the door stowing the Flight Attendant jumpseat upon arrival at the gate and going over securing the cabin for arrival.,,A CRJ900 flight crew must make difficult decisions when the sole flight attendant aboard is incapacitated by food poisoning.,"A flight attendant on a CRJ900 aircraft became incapacitated due to food poisoning, which manifested with symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, and severe cramps. Despite initial attempts to continue her duties, her condition deteriorated, leading her to inform the captain she could not perform her responsibilities. The captain, referencing company procedures (FOM), coordinated with a passenger who was an EMT to monitor her condition and take appropriate actions. The flight landed safely, with the EMT assisting in securing the cabin and moving the flight attendant to a passenger seat. Upon deplaning, she was evaluated by EMTs and later at an airport clinic, diagnosed with food poisoning, and advised against flying. The incident highlighted the importance of early communication with crew scheduling and seeking timely medical assistance.",health and medical issues
