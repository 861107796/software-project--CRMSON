Between ZZZ1 and ZZZZZ Captain did a normal system monitor check. Upon looking at the COND page; he noticed the AFT Cargo Temp at 180 degrees (Steady Green); asked me if I had seen a temp that high; I replied No! We kept an eye on it; over the next 10 minutes; noticed it rising to 188 degrees; then 194 degrees (still Steady Green) where it stayed for the duration of the flight. This made us uncomfortable for normal Cargo Bay temperatures in my 3;000+ hours flying this aircraft at 2 different airlines have never exceeded cabin temperatures during cruise. We simultaneously started looking into what could be a catastrophic problem. I got into the QRH AOM/FOM/and other manuals to look for temperature limitations and fixes. I found none; anywhere. During the same time; Captain got on the Phone with Operations and phone patched to Maintenance Control; where they attempted multiple resets to no success. When Captain got off the phone with Maintenance; he said; 'Well nothing fixed It; and they (Maintenance) said we are on our own.'At that point; we agreed as a crew that we didn't know what was going on down there. We were both not comfortable taking an aircraft with this indication over water; with limited divert options to an international location; and with no company or Contract Maintenance at the destination not knowing what was going on down there. The indication was steady at this point; not rising higher [than] 194 degrees; nor giving any other indications to the back when we notified the Flight Attendants and told them what was going on. At this point; we felt we were not in a land as soon as possible scenario; but in a land as soon as practical scenario but keeping land as soon as possible options available and we decided to divert to ZZZ2. We gave ATC a PAN PAN call since we were going to a divert airport that wasn't our alternate but that we were not at the time an emergency aircraft; we just wanted to have all our bases covered. We notified Dispatch both via phone patch and ACARS. During descent we were cleared the ZZZZZ Arrival to ZZZ2.We were still grossly overweight with a lot of gas; so we referenced the overweight Checklist. With that; we decided that with the condition still not worsening from what had been continuously indicated with no secondary indications or issues coming from the cabin; Captain and I both agreed that in an effort not to compound the problem we should hold to burn down gas; but having immediate [landing] options nearby; so we held at ZZZZZ1 at 16;000 ft. for 30-40 min and got to a calculated weight that would put us on deck in ZZZ2 right at Max landing weight. We continued to ZZZ2 via the arrival; for an uneventful Runway XX landing. On a side note; the XX transition from the ZZZZZ Arrival is a bit of a slam dunk. We asked for a bit longer final to get down; stabilized; and situated; and ATC approach gave us a few last second altitude; headings; and speed amendments through final which started to task saturate us as we prepared for landing. For example: open descent from 6;000-3;000; we were told to amend altitude and maintain 4;000 ft. while passing 4;200 feet; thrust idle; and speed brakes out. We blew through the altitude and had to climb back up Auto Pilot off; ALT horn blaring; and engines spooling up to 80+%; and getting speed brakes back in. We were also given several headings through final; and were asked to slow to final approach speed 10 plus miles outside the final approach fix at 4;000 feet; and approach didn't give us an approach clearance until we had flown through the glide slope on the localizer; and had to join from above; in order to sequence aircraft landing [Runway] XYL; which started to compound our landing configuration planning; and a go around was not something we were hoping to do; especially off of a PAN PAN call. We later found that on a couple of occurrences; ATC did not pass the PANPAN or divert info from Center to Center to Approach. We were later reassigned upon arrival to fly a ZZZ3 Turn that left in 5 minutes.I told Company that we just went through a lot; and that if they wanted us to fly that turn; that I needed a break for an amount of time that I was setting; some food; and so the Captain and I went and had a sit down meal; decompressed; talked about what had happened; after an hour or so I assessed my fitness for duty and felt I was good to fly the turn. The Captain and I were sitting on the jet; and when we called for push going to ZZZ3; Ramp told us to hold and that Maintenance wanted to talk to us. The maintenance team member got on the radio; asked if we were the crew that brought Aircraft X in from ZZZ; I replied yes; and he told us we needed to fill out a fume report. Captain asked what he was talking about; and told him this was the first we have heard about any fume incident. The Maintainer on the radio said the Flight Attendants had filed a fume report after the flight; and we needed to do the same. The Flight Attendants never told us anything about fumes nor their intent to fill out any such reports. Captain then filed a fume report said he had no information to give for we knew nothing about it. I felt Captain had communicated very clearly what was going on to the flight attendants about the situation; and our intent to divert. They had never communicated any such issues during any duration of or after the flight. Unknown from the high temperature in the Aft Cargo Bay. We did later saw that Maintenance replaced the sensor in the aft cargo bay via the app. We were curious that with all the ZZZ team members in Training vests if maybe they stacked the bags in the aft cargo bay above the line and possibly covered the sensor or did something to It. However; As far as the 'suspected' fume event; there was no communication from the flight attendants to the cockpit crew for this event. We noticed via the app that Maintenance later deferred the APU to prevent 'further fume events' due to the suspected fume event we were later notified about from ZZZ2 Maintenance. Not sure why if there is a fume event (or even a suspected fume event) why they don't further investigate the problem or fix the problem; rather than just pencil whip it into deferment. If there was any fumes in this situation; how would MX (Maintenance) know they came from the APU and not from any potential problem we were encountering? Put quick reference limitations on a Cockpit Card or in the QRH or checklist to quickly reference for situations such as these. I felt like we were on an Easter egg hunt for something that we later found wasn't there which wasted a lot of our decision making time. I know that Airbus FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) and other manufacture manuals/reference material has such limitations for quick reference from my experience at a previous Airbus airline. Why can't the company get on board with Airbus??? Make sure Flight Attendants communicate to the cockpit if they were smelling fumes.,,,,A321 First Officer reported an abnormally elevated Aft Cargo Bay temperature during cruise. After conferring with maintenance; the flight executed a precautionary diversion for maintenance.,"The incident involved an A321 flight crew (Party 1) and a flight attendant (Party 2). During the flight, the crew noticed an abnormally high aft cargo bay temperature (194 degrees), which was above standard operating parameters. The crew consulted manuals and contacted maintenance but found no immediate solution. Concerned about the situation, particularly over water with limited diversion options, the crew decided to divert to ZZZ2. They made a PAN PAN call to inform ATC and contacted dispatch. During descent and landing at ZZZ2, the crew encountered challenges with overweight landing conditions and ATC communication, but the landing was uneventful. Post-landing, maintenance informed the crew that a fume report had been filed by the flight attendants, though the crew had no prior knowledge of fumes or related issues during the flight. Maintenance deferred the APU to prevent further fume events. The crew expressed concerns about the lack of communication from the flight attendants regarding the suspected fume event and questioned the adequacy of maintenance's response. They recommended improved communication protocols between the cockpit and cabin crew, better access to quick reference materials for such situations, and a more thorough investigation of potential issues instead of deferred fixes.",fume/smoke incident

She stated 'could be electrical'. I stopped the aircraft; I got a minor whiff of something but it dissipated immediately. FO (First Officer) smelled nothing. We reported smoke in the cabin to ground and requested Airport rescue and Fire Fighting. We considered running the Smoke/AVIONICS SMOKE/Fumes but needed more information; (global assessment). I called up the 1st and she stated she was unaware of what was going on. I called back to the rear of the aircraft and 2nd stated it had begun to dissipate. After a brief discussion with FO; I elected to taxi to the gate and have Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting follow us and access the situation. Aircraft deplaned normally. 1st was unaware there was an issue 4th thought it was an electrical odor 2nd stated there was an odor but not a burning odor. He noticed a lite haze in the reading lights. [The possible cause] was primarily due to the dark cabin; communications among cabin crew. In a perfect world; there would have been better communication between all of the flight attendants; prior to calling up the flight deck. A more concrete assessment could have made with all eyes on the situation. Then the degree of urgency; and solid information can be transmitted more efficiently to the Captain.,,Taxiing to the gate on the terminal ramp we received a cabin call from the #4 FA (Flight Attendant) reporting smoke in the cabin. CA stopped the aircraft to assess the situation and asked if I smelled smoke or odor. I did not see or smell smoke or odor in the cockpit. CA said he sensed a brief odor but not burning. We called ground to request Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting due to the cabin smoke report. We discussed completing the Smoke/AVIONICS SMOKE/ Fumes checklist but after a follow up call to the FAs about the cabin environment the #1 said she didn't see or smell smoke or odor and #2 and #4 said the smoke/odor had dissipated. Due to close proximity to the gate CA decided to continue to the gate for further evaluation by the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting personnel. The smoke report was entered in the AML and the fumes report [was] completed.,,A319 flight crew reported a fume/smoke event during arrival taxi to gate.,"An A319 flight encountered a fume/smoke event during its arrival taxi to the gate. The incident began when the fourth flight attendant (FA4) detected an odor and reported smoke, suspecting it might be electrical. The flight crew, led by the captain, halted the aircraft and assessed the situation. The captain noticed a brief whiff of something, while the first officer detected nothing. They contacted ground control and requested the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) team. The flight crew considered their checklist for smoke/fumes but sought more information. Upon contacting the cabin, FA1 reported no smoke or odor, while FA2 noted a dissipating odor and a light haze in the reading lights. The captain, after consulting with the first officer, decided to proceed to the gate for ARFF evaluation. The aircraft landed smoothly, and passengers deplaned normally. The event highlighted the challenges of communication among cabin crew in a darkened cabin. The suggested improvement was enhanced communication to ensure a more informed and coordinated response, allowing for a clearer assessment and more efficient information transfer to the flight deck. The incident underscores the importance of effective communication among cabin crew to enhance incident handling and preparedness.",fume/smoke incident

Engine; pressurization and pack indications were normal. The FO (First Officer) and I noticed that I had adjusted the temperature selectors full cold due to the very humid 100 degree conditions at ZZZ. We both agreed that the air conditioning systems had likely iced up based on previous aircraft experience. The FO selected higher temperatures to melt any ice. About a minute later; airflow returned to normal. At the same time we received an interphone call; which the FO answered; from FA1 (Flight Attendant 1) saying hot air was flowing into the cabin and it smelled like dirty socks. The FO said we turned the temperature up but would now turn it down and to call back if the problem did not get better. Cool air returned to the flight deck and cabin and we continued to ZZZ1 uneventfully. During the post flight walk around at ZZZ1; the FO discovered a bird strike in the right engine with feathers on the bypass fan blades and core compressor blades. During the van ride to the hotel; FA2; FA3; & FA4 said they called FA1 during the hot airflow incident on initial climbout and reported they smelled burned chicken; cooked chicken; and a burned bird strike smell. When FA1 called the flight deck; she said it smelled like dirty socks. My decision to continue to ZZZ1 would have [been] different if I had heard any words like burned; cooked; chicken; or bird strike. The decision of FA1 to not relay the very accurate observations of FA2; FA3; & FA4 to the flight deck was not good and could have allowed serious consequences to develop including engine failure; engine destruction; human injuries or loss of life.

The Captain adjusted the temperature selectors to full cold due to the extremely hot and humid conditions at ZZZ. Both the Captain and the First Officer (FO) believed the air conditioning systems had iced up based on prior experience. The FO then increased the temperature settings to attempt to melt any ice, and airflow returned to normal shortly afterward. At the same time, the flight deck received an interphone call from Flight Attendant 1 (FA1), who reported that hot air was flowing into the cabin and that it smelled like ""dirty socks."" The FO assured FA1 that the temperature would be adjusted and instructed her to call back if the issue persisted. The airflow and temperature in both the flight deck and cabin subsequently returned to normal, and the flight continued to its destination, ZZZ1, without further incident. Following the flight, the Captain discovered evidence of a bird strike on the right engine during the post-flight walk-around, including feathers embedded in the bypass fan blades and core compressor blades. During the ride to the hotel, other flight attendants (FA2, FA3, and FA4) reported that they had called FA1 during the initial climbout and detected smells resembling ""burnt chicken,"" ""cooked chicken,"" or a ""burnt bird strike"" odor. However, FA1 only described the smell as ""dirty socks"" when contacting the flight deck. The Captain emphasized that had he been aware of the more specific descriptions provided by the other flight attendants, his decision to continue to ZZZ1 might have been different, as the smells could have indicated a more serious issue such as engine damage or failure. The Captain highlighted the importance of clear and accurate communication among all crew members. He suggested that flight attendants should relay specific and precise observations to the flight deck to ensure that potential issues are fully understood and addressed. This could prevent more serious consequences, such as engine failure or other safety risks.",fume/smoke incident

I conveyed what had happed to both FA A and the CA.  Shortly after 10;000 feet as I was heading forward to retrieve a set of headphones for another guest; as I walk by; I find her laying across XX1 and 2 with her head propped up on her book bag on the aisle arm rest; head hanging over into the aisle without a mask.  I tried rousing her quietly with no response from her and then gently tapped her on the shoulder and her exclaiming; 'What?!  What do you want?'  I politely asked her to please put her mask on and cover both her nose and mouth as required and to please ensure her seatbelt remained fastened while the seatbelt sign was on as we were still ascending.  She begrudgingly complied as she continued to complain and others around her asked her to wear it as well.  During service; once again; Passenger X had her mask below her chin as she sat with her foot propped up in the seat and was painting her toenails.  I politely asked her again to comply with the mask requirement and to please not polish her toenails as the fumes were offensive to those around her.  She denied painting her toenails (with polish in an opened [bottle and] nail polish remover pad in hand). I explained to her once again that wearing a mask is a requirement that she had been made aware of prior to boarding and that it wasn't fair to the other passengers and crew on board as everyone else was diligent in complying. I also made her aware that she had been informed several times.  As I started to walk forward to let FA A know what had transpired.  We called the CA and let him know that we were doing and to be prepared in the event that the situation escalated.  The guest in front of her Passenger Y asked if there was something more I could do or move her when suddenly her voice level became elevated and she said 'There!  I pulled the mask up and I have a headache so go away!' Subsequently we (FA A and myself) asked the Passenger Y if he would be more comfortable in another seat and he accepted.  Passenger Y and several other guests commended us for how we handled the situation.  Passenger Y gave his permission for this airline to contact him regarding the situation and events. Passenger X complied for the rest of the flight.  Upon final compliance before landing; Passenger X was asked by both FA A and myself to again stow her bags which she finally did by tossing and kicking them under the seat.  Upon landing she quickly stood; gathered her belongings and hurried off of the plane before rows in front of her stood.  Although we understand the importance of wanting to retain customer loyalty; this kind of behavior should not be tolerated for the sake of one over an entire cabin of guests and employees.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger did not comply with wearing a face mask during flight and exhibited other non-compliant behavior.,"A flight attendant encountered a passenger who repeatedly failed to comply with mask-wearing regulations and other cabin behavior guidelines. The passenger, identified as X, was reminded multiple times before takeoff to stow her belongings and wear her mask. During the flight, Passenger X disregarded these instructions, lying across seats and removing her mask. She also engaged in painting her toenails, despite being asked to stop due to fumes bothering others. When addressed, Passenger X became confrontational, raising her voice and refusing to comply. The flight attendant and crew, including the Chief Attendant, took steps to mitigate the situation, offering alternative seating to affected passengers. Passenger X eventually complied with mask requirements for the remainder of the flight but quickly left the aircraft upon landing. The flight attendant emphasized that such behavior should not be tolerated, prioritizing the comfort and safety of all passengers and crew.",fume/smoke incident

The Captain was already there; we said hello; [and] I did my walk around then started my preflight duties. As we were boarding; we were having the standard (where are you from) conversation. Captain told me he lives out of base and is relatively new to ZZZ. He then said he was actually thinking about changing bases soon because he can't take the attitudes of ZZZ First Officer's. Personally; I have been a ZZZ First Officer for 5 years and have never heard of a problem. Being concerned; I asked what's been going on. He never really gave me an example; but he basically said that these First Officers have a problem with challenging the Captain. Then he said that he is sure that we won't have that issue on this trip because I don't seem like that type of guy. Then he continued and told me that if I do want to play the game of who knows more; that he promises that it won't end well for me. I assured him that I don't play those games and I only speak up if it's a safety issue or I feel it necessary. And that was about the extent of my briefing from the Captain. I thought it was odd that at this day and age; my briefing was basically 'don't challenge the Captain'. I then told him that he can't hurt my feelings and to please speak up if he sees me making a mistake.At this time; Maintenance comes into the flight deck to tell us a tire that was questionable was well within their limits and that we were good to go. Maintenance questioned what guidance we had and we explained our guidance is much different than theirs; usually more conservative. I gave the mechanic the example of the hydraulic fluid quantities and their 'normal fill' range. The book states if it is at all outside of those limits; even for thermal expansion; that we are required to call Maintenance. The Captain then spoke up and said that wasn't true as they've added a note saying that as long as we don't have any ECAMs that we don't have to call Maintenance. I was surprised he said that and asked when it changed. He said it changed a long time ago; probably 6 months ago. I said that I must have missed the change and we moved on. During the taxi; we had a crosswind that was technically a 1 knot tailwind. I said ok no problem; TOGA take off and I'll go to the TPS and work the number. Captain told me not to use the TPS but to just request a new TPS using 'request T.O. Data' and put the tailwind in there. I said that doesn't work. You can compute the tailwind penalty manually or call and have a new TPS sent with the tailwind penalty added. He said 'oh really; well you're the only First Officer that seems to think that'. He then continued and told me that about 30 of his last First Officer's requested a new TPS with the tailwind. I said that I found that odd because they make it every clear in training that you cannot do this. I asked if I could just do this manually for now and we could talk about the tailwind and the TPS during our flight to ZZZ1. He agreed. As I was heads down doing the penalty; the Captain was swerving down the taxiway because he was also heads down doing the same thing. I said I'll take care of this so you can taxi. He said no it's ok; I'm good at taxiing. So a short time later; I said ok we have a TOGA take off and our penalty is 970 LBS. off MTOW. He said; not its 1;050 [LBS]. I said ok maybe I looked at it wrong. I looked again and it was in fact 970 lbs. He looked again and agreed as he saw his mistake. We were legal to take off. Once we were on our way and not busy with ZZZ; I looked up the note about the normal fill for the hydraulics. I read the note and it still says we are required to call Maintenance. I showed the Captain. He read it and was surprised that it said what it said and that he must have missed the last sentence. We moved on and I said let's look at the TPS. I said that; like the hydraulic issue; I'm looking this up for my own personal knowledge. Things change all the time and who knows; maybe [Company] pushed the button that allows us to grab a new TPS with a tailwind. So I said I'll request a new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind and see what it says. He said; we are in flight; you can't request a new TPS because we are in flight. I said sure you can and pushed the button and spit it out. I showed him the new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind compared to our original TPS and both were identical. The Captain was in the TPS flow chart in the QRH and was in disbelief that it didn't say that you could request a new TPS with a tailwind. He then said 'damn it if I'm going to lose a beer over this'. At this point; I stopped him and said the he wasn't going to lose a beer because we aren't playing a game of who knows what. There have been a ton of changes and if something as important as when to call Maintenance or how to know if we're legal for takeoff; I want to know. That was it. At this point I realized that tension was building. The Captain was irritated that I was challenging him. I decided at this point that I wasn't going to speak up unless I absolutely had to. Now one thing I didn't mention was that the Captain briefed the flight attendants to stay seated for 1 hr and 30 minutes after takeoff as a precaution because of what was left of the hurricane. We were routed around to the north of it but he still kept them down. I thought that was excessive. The ride was smooth. I didn't say anything. Nor did I say a thing when we had to deviate around cells. He would do an all call and tell everyone to take their seats. We were deviating a long way around these cells and I had absolutely no doubt that it would be a smooth ride. We even had reports from other aircraft that the ride was smooth. The other thing I felt was odd; was that less than one minute after he called the flight attendants; he was surprised that they were still dealing with their carts and not already in their seats. I honestly don't think he has any idea what the flight attendants have to do to clean up and sit down. The flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 was mostly smooth. We have specific guidance in regards to the ride quality when it comes to flight attendants and passengers.Either way we had an uneventful flight to ZZZ1 and we had good conversation. The next morning we were getting ready for our leg back to ZZZ. We were ready for departure but I believe we had to wait for traffic behind us. The Captain put the delay for pay purposes into ACARS. I was just making small talk and said I heard there was a potentially easier way of doing it that might save him time. This set him off. The Captain kept saying; almost yelling 'it's amazing when you upgrade everyone tries to prove you wrong. Just you wait; it's amazing. Everyone just tries to prove you wrong.' This little rant went on for an uncomfortable amount of time. I finally stopped him and said that is absolutely not what I'm trying to do and that I'm sorry that I somehow came off that way. I said that there have been so many big changes that it's very difficult to keep up and so easy to miss. I told him how just last month I was told that I was doing a checklist incorrectly. We looked it up and sure enough they were correct. I told him there were no hard feelings and I was glad it was brought to my attention. That was the end of that conversation.  I want to be clear the reason I wrote such detail about the events leading up to the diversion is because I think it's important and can better understand how we ended up in ZZZ2. It's my leg to ZZZ from ZZZ1. We are in a full 320. We have been airborne for less than 20 minutes. The Captain is eating his kung pow kitty as the Flight Attendant calls. She said she turned the oven on and about 1 minute later smoke started coming out. Captain asked if she turned it off and she said she did. He instructed her not to open the oven and that we are diverting. He hangs up with her; looks at me and said smoke in the cabin; we're going down now! Before I could say a word he grabs the mic and [advises ATC] and said we needed to get on the ground immediately. He then dons his O2 mask even though there wasn't even a hint of smoke or even a smell in the flight deck. Because his was on; I grabbed mine. After about 2 minutes; the Captain realized he couldn't communicate very well and he takes it off; as do I. Now I can't remember if we knew on initial contact that the oven was no longer smoking or if it was just a few minutes later. Either way; the Captain and I knew that there were dinner rolls in the oven; it started smoking 1 minute after she turned it on and that it stopped smoking as soon as she turned the oven off.I could not believe we were diverting....for toast. The Captain was busy running the smoke in the cabin checklist and I was flying the plane and talking to ATC. I strongly considered talking to the Captain and asking if we should possibly reconsider the diversion since it doesn't seem to be a safety of flight issue. Considering the way he has responded to any type of questioning; and the fact that he was currently deep in the yellow and headed for the red; if I questioned his judgement; it would have put him through the roof and that would have been very unsafe in any phase of flight; especially a diversion. I decided the safest course was to just go along with his diversion and not question him. During the diversion; he must have fired off a text to Dispatch saying we needed to divert. I don't know what his message said. Initially I suggested we turn back towards ZZZ1. So we did. I then realized we were far too heavy for the short runway. I pulled up ZZZ3 and it was too far for the Captain. At this time Dispatch responds and said to divert to ZZZ2. I plug it in and it was 40 miles to the East. I said Dispatch said to go to ZZZ2. He said that's where he wants to go also. I told ATC and we started to head that way. I slowed the plane down to give us time; changed destination and set up for the ILS. I did the landing distance for our weight and it said around 8;000 feet; we had 13;200 feet. I briefed the Captain and told him I was doing flaps full with manual auto brakes. Since we had such a long runway I was going to stay off the brakes until under 100 kts to keep them from getting too hot. I told him I already spoke with ATC and said we'd either make a right turn off or back taxi. He cut me off and said we were going to be stopping on the runway and having the trucks look us over with their equipment and look for any hot spots and to also check our brake temps. I had a nice touchdown and used the brakes as I briefed. We came to a stop and watched the trucks surround us. As we sit there we put the brake fans on; the temps never got over 220. Minutes go by and I said I'll use this time to call Tower and ask exactly where we are parking. I got snapped at by the Captain once again. He said I needed to calm down and to stop interfering with their emergency procedures. A short time later; Tower called us asking if we were ready to taxi yet. Captain responded that after the fire trucks have looked us over and checked our brake temps that we'd then be able to taxi. Tower said he were completely fine. Again; our brake temps were never above 220. Captain tells Tower we are ready to taxi and we do. There were ramp personnel waiting for us and they parked us on the ramp just before where they park the RJ's so we don't block them. Air stairs are brought to our plane and the fire fighters confirm there is no fire and they leave. At this point we haven't deplaned. Captain looked to me and said he said he was done flying and that it would be unsafe for us to continue due to the nature of the high stress emergency. I said that I think we should consider just getting fuel and continuing. Of course we needed an overweight inspection. He said we were done. So now we needed to get the passengers to the terminal. The Captain deemed it unsa,,,,A320 First Officer reported less than optimal CRM combined with smoke in the cabin caused by dinner rolls in the oven; which ultimately led to a diversion.,"The incident began with a briefing where the Captain expressed concerns about past First Officers challenging his authority, which the First Officer found unusual. Disagreements arose regarding procedures, such as requesting a new TPS in flight, leading to growing tension. During the return leg, smoke from the oven, caused by burning dinner rolls, prompted the Captain to divert to ZZZ2. Despite the First Officer's consideration of continuing, the Captain, under stress, opted for an overweight inspection and refused to proceed further. This resulted in a delay, with passengers disembarking and the aircraft being parked for the night.",fume/smoke incident

Shortly after; we both felt our throats burning. C Flight Attendant said she also saw smoke inside the lavatory. passenger also seemed paranoid. We called the Captain and notified him of the events.Police met the aircraft and questioned the passenger. Initially passenger lied to the police saying he didn't do anything. Police Officers and TSA came onto the plane looking for evidence and could not find anything. When we deplaned the aircraft we stayed in the gate area while on the phone with Operations. In the gate area; we noticed the passenger shaking the police officers hand and walking away. As he was walking away; he dropped the vape pen on the ground and picked it up. We notified the police and they detained him. The police tested the vape pen and it tested positive for THC (marijuana). The passenger then confessed to smoking in the back lavatory and in the cabin among other passenger. At the time of writing this; my throat is still burning and I have a headache. I do feel a little off and not sure if it is the stress of the event or effects of the THC.,,Passenger came onboard; confused about seating. We explained to him we have an opening seating policy. When I came around to take his order; he; confusingly reading the menu; asked for items we didn't have on the menu. He then orders a Jack and Coke. I checked his ID to make sure he was of age and said no problem. As I was taking the next rows order; he interrupts me asking where to buy the snacks. I explained to him we'd be around shortly with pretzels as our snack option. As I went back to taking orders; he interrupts me again asking if he could use the lavatory. I explained to him the seatbelt sign was on and I was not able to give him permission as long as the seatbelt sign was illuminated. At this point; I finished taking orders and waited behind the B Flight Attendant as she finished taking her last row of orders. Passenger apparently got up right after I informed him the seatbelt sign was on because I felt a hard tap on my shoulder of him explaining he had to use the bathroom. I told him politely that we both needed to wait until she was done taking her last order. At this point; I informed the B of unusually behavior from him. As I was pouring drinks and the B was putting pretzels in the snack basket; the passenger came bolting out of the lavatory; leaving the door wide open. As I went to close the door; the B and I both realized he smelled strongly of marijuana. I walked into the lavatory and smelled an even greater odor of marijuana. There is no doubt in my mind at this point; that the passenger was smoking weed in the bathroom. We went up to talk to the A; called the Captain and all decided that we needed police assistance upon landing. We also decided to monitor the passenger. Passenger appeared paranoid and edgy as he watched us call the Captain and watched each of us every time we walked by. Upon landing; police met him and questioned him. He admitted to using a vape pen but said it was not marijuana. He said he could not find said vape pen. Ultimately he had to be let go for no evidence. As passenger was walking away; he [waved] good bye to police and the vape pen fell out of his pants. He was taken into custody and I wrote a police report. The vape pen was tested positive for marijuana. Passenger also admitted to smoking in the cabin during his interrogation.,,Flight attendants reported misconduct by a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight.,"The incident involved a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight, leading to a conflict with the flight attendants. The flight attendants noticed a strong smell of marijuana when the passenger exited the aft lavatory and observed smoke inside the lavatory. The passenger appeared paranoid and initially lied to the police about his actions. The flight attendants called the captain, and upon landing, police were summoned. During questioning, the passenger denied using marijuana but later admitted to smoking in the cabin and lavatory after a vape pen, which tested positive for THC, was found in his possession. The passenger was detained, and the flight attendants reported the incident to the authorities. The flight attendant experienced throat irritation and a headache, possibly due to the effects of THC exposure. The police confirmed the vape pen contained THC, leading to the passenger's confession and detention.",fume/smoke incident

Additionally the passenger reported he saw smoke emanating from the overhead panel in the lavatory. Uncharacteristic of him simply smoking in the lavatory; but possibly something much more serious and potentially life-threatening; an actual aircraft fire. The smoke alarm was activated and projecting an extremely loud and piercing tone throughout the cabin. This caused distress among passengers as well as the FA's. Communicating with the FA's over the interphone was very difficult due to the combined chaotic nature of the alarm and the chaos surrounding its activation. The FA's were having difficulty extinguishing the alarm. I did not know if this was due to continued smoke; or some delay in extinguishing the alarm. Our collective belief was the situation could be much more serious. The FA's asked me for assistance in evaluating the situation. I knew my assistance in the aft of the aircraft would be a departure from our standard protocol. However; based on the information we received at the time; I concluded my assistance might very well mitigate a further degradation in the cabin and secure a safe condition as quickly as possible. The First Officer had demonstrated confidence and technical competence; thus I had no reason to doubt her ability to navigate and control the aircraft; as well as communicate with outside agencies while I assisted the FA's with what appeared and sounded to be a rapidly deteriorating situation. In the interest of time and consequently safety; I elected to personally inspect and evaluate the severity of the incident. I did this in order to determine the most expeditious course of action regarding continuing to [our destination] or turning back.As we were mere minutes from the critical point on our flight plan there was only one FA present in the forward part of the aircraft during the time I exited the flight deck. I shut the flight deck door before the forward FA could enter the flight deck. After working with the FA's to silence the alarm and after inspecting the lavatory and it's overhead panel; I determined there was no immediate threat of an actual aircraft fire; as there was no evidence of heat; burning; or residual smoke. I instructed the FA's to lock the lavatory; and reassess every few minutes. After I returned to the front of the aircraft; I established communication with the First Officer via interphone; and advised her I was ready to return to the flight deck; (after approximately 4-5 minutes). The smoke did not continue; so I opted to continue to [our destination]; as long as the condition didn't reappear. For reasons unknown to me; the First Officer left her seat to open the door rather than pushing the unlock button. About twenty minutes later; the FA's found an electronic cigarette in the toilet that was discarded in what appears to be an attempt to conceal its presence and cause for the smoke. After the passenger (who reported the smoke emanating from the overhead portion of the lavatory) was asked about the device; he did admit it was the cause for the smoke and activation of the smoke detector. I felt in the interest of safety; it was best to leave the flight deck and assess the situation personally; and that would be the most expeditious way to evaluate an overall course of action.At no time during the above events did I intentionally disregard standard procedure; rather I utilized my authority as the Captain to bring the situation to safe conclusion while being mindful of [Company policies].,,,,B737 Captain reported leaving the flight deck to evaluate smoke in the aft lav caused by a passenger's electronic cigarette.,"The incident involved a B737 flight crew responding to smoke in the aft lavatory, which was traced to a passenger's electronic cigarette. Upon notification, the smoke alarm activated, causing cabin chaos. The captain, departing from standard protocol, left the flight deck to personally assess the situation, concluding no immediate fire hazard existed. After extinguishing the alarm and inspecting the lavatory, the captain instructed the flight attendants to lock the lavatory and monitor the situation. Despite the First Officer's departure from standard procedure by opening the flight deck door, the captain returned and decided to continue the flight to the destination. Later, the flight attendants found the electronic cigarette, confirming its role in the incident. The captain's actions prioritized safety, aligning with company policies.",fume/smoke incident

We called the flight attendants and (in accordance with standard operating procedures) the FO stepped out of the cockpit and a FA came in; closing the cockpit door behind him. While the FO was in the lavatory; a female passenger came up to the forward galley. The FA informed her that she must use one of the lavatories in the back of the aircraft or return to her seat; but that she could not remain in the forward galley. The passenger was Hispanic and claimed not to understand the FA. Luckily; all three of the FAs spoke fluent Spanish and it was again explained in Spanish. The passenger still refused to move and she verbally abused and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA came up to assist. The 'A' FA called up to inform me what was going on. I could hear loud voices over the interphone and the FAs speaking to the passenger in Spanish. Meanwhile; the FO had exited the lavatory and was now also in the galley. After several more minutes; the passenger's husband came up and convinced her to return to her seat. After she was seated and with the three FAs plus the male deadheading FA guarding and blocking access to the forward galley and the cockpit door; the cockpit door was opened and the FA exited the cockpit and the FO entered. We then locked down the cockpit in accordance with a Threat Level 1. I contacted Dispatch with our status and requested to have law enforcement meet the aircraft in ZZZ. After arriving in ZZZ; law enforcement removed the passenger from the aircraft.After speaking with the FO over the interphone; and visually confirming the galley was secure; I determined that it was safer and more prudent to have the FO in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. This scenario needs to be addressed during recurrent security training. What is the safest course of action if the cockpit is locked down with one of the pilots in the cabin? If it is determined that keeping the cockpit on lockdown is the safest course; where should the FA sit? In the jumpseat or in a pilot seat?,The reporter stated that this encounter with a passenger was more of a misunderstanding; but it brought up the bigger issue of what to do if the threat is real. If a real threat was just outside the cockpit door with the first officer out of the cockpit with a single pilot and flight attendant in the cockpit; what is the proper procedure? Do you put the FA in the pilot's seat where they have access to the flight controls; but you can keep an eye on him/her? Do you put the FA in the jumpseat where you can't see them? The reporter mused 'could the FA be in on it'; what is really happening on the other side of the door? The reporter stated that he feels unprepared for which procedure should the pilot use for these type of scenarios. He feels more training should occur addressing these issues.,,,B737-800 Captain reported that a passenger refused to leave the forward galley while the First Officer was using the forward lavatory causing a security issue.,"The incident occurred during the cruise phase of a B737-800 flight about 45 minutes prior to landing at ZZZ. The First Officer (FO) required a physiological break and temporarily left the cockpit to use the forward lavatory. A flight attendant (FA) entered the cockpit in accordance with standard procedures, closing the door behind them. During the FO's absence, a Hispanic passenger approached the forward galley. The FA instructed the passenger to either use one of the rear lavatories or return to her seat, as she was not permitted to remain in the galley. The passenger, who did not understand English, was initially uncooperative. However, the three FAs, who spoke fluent Spanish, repeatedly explained the situation. Despite this, the passenger refused to comply, verbally abused, and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA was called to assist. The 'A' FA informed the Captain via interphone, who heard loud voices and ongoing dialogue between the FAs and the passenger in Spanish. The FO, having exited the lavatory, joined the situation in the galley. After several minutes, the passenger's husband intervened and persuaded her to return to her seat. With the passenger seated and the FAs, including the male deadheading FA, positioned to block access to the forward galley and cockpit door, the cockpit door was opened. The FA exited the cockpit, and the FO returned. The cockpit was then secured in accordance with Threat Level 1 protocols. Upon arrival at ZZZ, law enforcement was summoned to remove the passenger from the aircraft. The Captain, after consulting with the FO and visually confirming the galley's security, determined it was safer for the FO to remain in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. The incident highlighted the need for recurrent security training, particularly addressing scenarios where the cockpit is locked down with one pilot in the cabin. The discussion raised questions about the safest seating arrangement for an FA in such situations—whether in the jumpseat or a pilot seat.",fume/smoke incident

I directed the flight deck crew to don oxygen masks and set the regulators to 100 percent and established crew communication. I then [advised] ATC and asked for direct [destination]. Shortly thereafter; the Flight Attendants notified us that the device and its spare batteries (which were also in a state of thermal runaway) were contained in the ion battery emergency containment bag and there was no smoke.The device was apparently an e-cigarette. As the device was contained and there was no smoke; I elected to discontinue the QRH. However; the flight deck crew remained on oxygen for the duration of the approach and landing. Approach and landing were uneventful. My biggest concern is that after attempting to notify the Flight Attendants that we were on oxygen; I never called them back. They were making announcements on my first attempt and I simply dropped calling them back off my to-do list. They were surprised when we landed and were surrounded by Fire Rescue.Distraction management continues to be an issue for all flight crews. As a Check Airman; I should have done a better job of communicating. Better use of all my resources would have kept this from happening. I found myself doing the lion's share of the work in the cockpit when I had a very competent First Officer to help me. Simply dividing a few more of the tasks would have freed up my mind and allowed me to think more clearly.,,,,B737 Captain reported the flight crew donned oxygen masks and asked for direct destination after a Flight Attendant reported smoke in the cabin related to thermal runaway of an e-cigarette battery.,"The incident occurred during the arrival into [destination] when smoke was reported in the cabin due to an e-cigarette battery experiencing thermal runaway.

My first officer and I also discussed the likely possibility of a fuel spill somewhere near us on the ramp. In my experience on the MD-80 it is not uncommon to get a faint; exhaust like fume smell in the air conditioning system; and thick condensation during hot; muggy summer nights such as this one was in ZZZ. I assume the smell was stronger in the cabin than in the cockpit since both the FO and I had our air vents closed. The flight attendants requested that I make a PA stating that everything was ok and there was no cause for alarm and we are aware of the condensation and smell; which I did. The two forward flight attendants also informed me that 'they opened the doors in back' which I thought meant that the two rear flight attendants had opened the rear aircraft doors for ventilation. Our number three and one FAs; meant to inform me that passengers were exiting through the over wing exits. This was a simple misunderstanding that was caused by task saturation in the cockpit; monitoring the APU indications; and determining the cause of the smell. I was later informed that passengers took it upon themselves to open all four over wing exits and exit onto the wing. I was told that it was estimated that 15-20 people were on each wing at one point. Our number two flight attendant vocally told passengers to stop exiting through the over wing exits. The FA had no chance to prevent passengers from initiating the uncommanded evacuation given the crowded aisle and interior that is typical of everyone standing when the seat belt sign is turned off. Our number four flight attendant made a PA instructing passengers to stop and to not evacuate or exit though the over wing exits. I did not hear this PA. The FO and I opened our air vents and the fuel odor got stronger and the condensation thickened. I then shut off the Ram Air; APU AIR switch; and both packs; which caused the fuel smell to lessen considerably in intensity and the condensation stopped completely. A man who works the ramp came up to the cockpit and told us we had fuel leaking out of the APU. I then told him to connect external power and I began to shut down the APU. I also told the first officer to go outside and inspect the APU fuel leak with the ops personnel. We informed ground of the fuel leak and we requested ARFF to come inspect the area as a precaution; which they did. I was told by the gate agent that only one person had jumped off the left wing. I was told by operations and my flight attendants that a few passengers came back into the airplane through the over wing doors; and the rest exited the wings on baggage belt loaders. There were no injuries that I know of. This was confirmed by all four flight attendants and ZZZ operations personnel. Upon inspection of the APU; fuel was in fact leaking out of the non-ram door area and the fuel spill was about fifteen feet in diameter. I was instructed by maintenance to pull 5 circuit breakers; which I did; secured the airplane with the securing check; and made the appropriate entries in the maintenance logbook.,,,,A fuel odor; later identified as an APU fuel issue; was detected as passengers began to deplane at the gate. A partial; uncommanded; evacuation was initiated by several passengers via the over wing exits. No injuries were reported.,"The incident occurred after a flight arrived at Airport ZZZ and completed its parking checklist. Upon opening the L1 door, the flight crew and forward flight attendants detected a faint fuel smell, which they initially attributed to external factors such as a neighboring aircraft being fueled, the APU running, and gusty northwest winds. The flight attendants requested the cockpit to make a passenger address (PA) to reassure passengers, which was done. However, there was a misunderstanding regarding the status of the aircraft doors and exits. Passengers, believing there was an emergency, opened the over wing exits and began exiting onto the wings without authorization. Despite efforts by the flight attendants to stop the uncommanded evacuation, several passengers exited before being directed back into the aircraft. The fuel smell intensified, leading the flight crew to shut off the APU and air conditioning systems, which reduced the odor and condensation. A ground staff member informed the cockpit of a fuel leak near the APU, prompting the crew to secure the aircraft, shut down the APU, and request ARFF (Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting) support as a precaution. Maintenance personnel inspected the APU and identified a fuel leak. The crew secured the aircraft, performed the necessary checks, and documented the issue in the maintenance logbook. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further incident. The cause of the fuel odor was later identified as a fuel leak from the APU, which was addressed by maintenance.",fume/smoke incident

I was the A Flight Attendant (FA) so I made an all call to the crew to see if they smelled it also. All flight attendants smelled a strange odor. The front smelled like musty socks and the back smelled like parmesan cheese. I called the captain to tell him about the smell and he said they smelled it as well but they were climbing higher and thought it would dissipate. The D-E-H were all sitting in the forward galley with me. We all had headaches and distorted vision. Soon afterwards; I called the back galley to see if the odor dissipated; it didn't and was informed that our one pregnant (F) Flight attendant was being put on Oxygen. I called the captain to tell him that (F) was on oxygen and while I was on the phone I was informed B-C-F were all on Oxygen. I told the captain we didn't feel safe continuing. He said they were turning the plane around. I got up to go check on the FA's in the back and immediately felt light-headed and caught myself on the jumpseat. The E flight attendant told me to sit down and we got the oxygen bottles down and we were sharing the two bottles between the four of us. We were in the air for about 50 mins total. We landed at XA:14. Upon landing no one in inflight met our aircraft. The 'B' FA called crew service center and within 15 minutes inflight showed up to check on us. We told the inflight supervisors that we wanted to have blood tests run for Carbon Monoxide poisoning. They arranged for transportation to see a company doctor. We arrived there at XC:00. The company doctor said that he couldn't do the blood test. We were involved in many company calls through-out this ordeal and taxis were arranged for us to go to the hospital to get the blood test done. I was never seen by the company doctor since the taxis were on their way to take us to the Emergency Room (ER). A Manager showed up and about an hour later the taxis came. We arrived at the Hospital [5 hours after landing]. We saw the gate agent; who met our flight; in the ER waiting room; who didn't feel well; and we were informed also that three of our passengers needed treatment. The ER process was very fast and had blood drawn to check our CO levels. The doctor informed us that we should have been admitted soon after getting off the airplane. The test results will be forwarded to the company. According to Station Maintenance they washed the left engine the night before and were supposed to let it run for 10-20 minutes as procedure dictated; but the proper time wasn't allotted.I suggest during a fume incident that it should be company policy that you go straight to the ER for CO testing.I suggest that maintenance not take shortcuts when it comes to crew & passenger safety.,,We opened the auxiliary kit and put on masks. It was decided that the F needed to go on oxygen immediately as she is 5 months pregnant and we did not know what kind of fumes we were inhaling. Within 10 minutes from the beginning of the smell; we had 2 more bottles of oxygen between the other 3 of us in the back (B; C and G). The G decided not to use oxygen.Upon landing and deplaning we were not met by any manager; supervisor or paramedic. We had to call to ask someone to meet us. We were told by our pilots (who received information from the engineers); that the planes left engine had been cleaned the night before and 'may' not have had the engine run for 10-20 minutes to burn off chemicals; even though that is protocol after engines are cleaned.At this point; I was extremely disoriented; my eyes burned and I had a splitting headache. We all wanted to see a doctor and have our CO levels tested. Shayna began making calls and arranged for [medical] to pick us all up. It took over an hour between getting off the plane and being picked up to be checked out by the company doctor.We found out shortly after arriving at clinic that they would be unable to perform the blood test we needed done. At this point we were trying to get [ground] to take us someplace that could do the test. A Manager showed up and said taxis were on their way. It took about an hour and a half to be shuttled to the hospital.Once at the hospital; we were all admitted extremely quickly. Once I met with the doctor; my blood was drawn and tested for CO levels. The doctor told me it was most likely to come back with normal levels because of how long it had been since our exposure to the toxic fumes and that we should have been tested within a few hours. The test results will be forwarded to the company.There needs to be a very specific protocol for when there is a toxic fume event. We should NOT have been sent to [company medical provider]. They were extremely unprofessional and were unable to perform the test we needed done. Hours were lost spending time there and getting transportation to a location that was able to do the test.,,After takeoff; A330 flight attendants detected a strong chemical odor similar to 'spoiled eggs and vomit' which physiologically affected the crew and passengers. The flight returned to the departure airport. Post flight medical examinations revealed physiological symptoms; but blood tests samples were hours delayed and inconclusive.,"The incident involved a flight where a strong chemical odor, described as resembling spoiled eggs and vomit, was detected shortly after takeoff. This odor led to physiological symptoms such as headaches and vision issues among the flight attendants and passengers. The flight was subsequently turned around and returned to the departure airport. Upon landing, the crew experienced delays in receiving medical attention, as the initial medical provider was unable to conduct necessary blood tests promptly. The ground personnel indicated that the odor may have originated from the left engine, which had been cleaned the night before but not run long enough to eliminate fumes, as per protocol. The flight attendant suggested improved protocols for carbon monoxide testing and against maintenance shortcuts, while the ground personnel emphasized the need for specific procedures and criticized the delayed medical response. The medical tests conducted hours later were inconclusive due to the delay.",fume/smoke incident

He flushed several times and opened the door. Flight Attendant B said; do you smell that. As soon as the words were out of her mouth I did smell it. I stopped the passenger from going to seat and asked where he put the cigarette. He denied it of course and when he opened his mouth it was as if a cloud of smoke came out. The smell was so strong. I had him stand in galley while I searched the LAV with the door opened. I opened the trash bin and pulled out the compartment. There was a bunch of paper towels and one Budweiser can (he had been drinking that). I pulled can out and smoke was coming out of the can. I called for the other Flight Attendant to get me a bunch of bottles of water while I put the can under water in the sink. I poured about 4 bottles into the can to ensure there was no possibility of a fire. He still continued to deny he did anything; but I said you were the only one drinking Budweiser and you were the only one in the LAV in the last half hour. I told him to give me his ID and go to his seat. He said 'can I talk to you?' To which I replied 'give me your ID take your seat and I will speak to you later.' Flight Attendant B notified A; who notified the Captain. Flight Attendant A made another no smoking announcement. I copied his information and filled out crewmember report of smoking. I gave him the bottom portion which notifies him that the incident will be reported to FAA. I also returned his ID. He started to say something and I stopped him. I said to him that he needed to really think about what could have happened to all of us on the aircraft because of his irresponsible and dangerous action. Had we not caught this immediately; I can't even imagine. He then pretended to sleep the remainder of the flight. The smoke detector did not go off. It should have.,,,,An A319 passenger was smoking a cigarette in the lavatory but the smoke detector failed to alert.

Flight Attendant B noticed the odor, confronted the passenger, and discovered a smoldering cigarette inside a beer can. She extinguished the cigarette by submerging the can in water and notified the other flight attendant and the captain. Flight Attendant A made a subsequent no-smoking announcement, and the passenger was required to provide his ID and return to his seat. The flight attendant reported the incident to the FAA, and the passenger was informed that the incident would be documented.

I stood up and knocked on the door and told the passenger to take her seat we were landing. She said she had to pee and she could 'do what ever she wanted.' I knocked again on the door and asked her if she was smoking in there because I could smell smoke and the smoke alarm was going off so she needed to get out right now! She said that I could not tell her what to do! The cockpit called back to inform us they had a light that said smoke in the lav and we informed him that we had a passenger that refused to go back to her seat. The landing gear was coming down and at this point I told her she better stay in there (if she came out she couldn't get to her seat without endangering the passenger in XXC) The Captain made a PA for the passenger in the lav to return to her seat immediately! She came out; cussing up a storm; and had sprayed something in the lav that she claimed was feminine hygiene spray. I repeated 'were you smoking in there?' She started waving her arms and saying 'she could do whatever the [explitive] she wanted and no one could [explitive] tell her what to do' over and over.Another Flight Attendant got her to sit down with the assistance of the passenger in XXC. I talked to the cockpit and informed them that she was now seated and her seat number. The Captain asked me to check the lav to make sure nothing was on fire and I did. She had sprayed something in there to hide the smell of smoke and it was overpowering! No cigs were found in trash can so I took my seat. There was no reason for her to spray that spray and be so defiant if she wasn't guilty! I smell cigarettes and the smoke alarm was going off. I did not smell her spray until she opened the door! She was 2 steps away from the lav the entire flight and she chose to go to the bathroom after we were seated! Police met the flight and questioned her and never came in to check the lav. This woman interfered with the duties of the flight crew; caused alarms to go off in the cockpit during sterile cockpit; told us we couldn't tell her what the [explitive] to do; and almost caused us to land standing up. She should not be allowed to fly again if she can't follow instructions and is going to carry on the way she did! Unfortunately; I believe the police let her go. They asked us if she did finally sit down; which she did...but that was not the problem; the problem was that she was smoking in lav! That is against FAA regulations; if was not just her not complying with crew member instructions...Unbelievable!,,,,An unruly passenger entered a lavatory on approach; apparently lit a cigarette and eventually set off the smoke alarm. The reporter/Flight Attendant's attempts to extricate the passenger were unsuccessful until the Captain made an announcement demanding she return to her seat. She then left the lav; which reeked with what she claimed was a feminine hygiene product; and excoriated the reporter in vulgar terms. The passenger was detained by airport police.,"The incident occurred during the approach to landing when a passenger entered the lavatory, lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke alarm and message panel. The Flight Attendant requested the passenger return to her seat, but she refused. The Captain addressed the passenger via a public announcement, prompting her to exit the lavatory, where she cursed and claimed to have used feminine hygiene spray. The Flight Attendant discovered the spray but no cigarettes, suggesting the passenger's defiance indicated guilt. The smoke alarm disrupted cockpit communication during a critical phase. The passenger was detained by police but not arrested. The Flight Attendant believes FAA regulations should be enforced against her for smoking in the lavatory and non-compliance.",fume/smoke incident

During boarding I got dizzy and my vision became blurred. I talked to another flight attendant and told her. I drank some water and sat down for a minute and ate some pretzels. I became even more nauseated and started to have dry heaves and eventually vomited once in-flight. I notified my Domicile in-flight and Supervisor. I notified union and was told this is a problem and they have tried to stop it for awhile now.

The flight attendant encountered the odor during preflight and when emptying trash, leading to dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, dry heaves, and vomiting. Despite measures like drinking water and resting, symptoms persisted, prompting notifications to the domicile, supervisor, and union. The union noted previous attempts to halt the practice, and the flight attendant remained off work two weeks later. A proposed solution was to cease using cleaner in the oven.",fume/smoke incident

Discussed the light with the Captain and because of the likelihood of a long delay in ZZZ; we elected to come to ZZZ1 and report the light 'On'. In ZZZ1; Maintenance found enough debris that the aircraft was removed from service to flush the oil system and recheck for debris. [Contributors]:1) There is no guidance for the flight crew regarding the chip detector. It is not part of the normal preflight inspection but the light is obvious if 'On'. Without guidance there is confusion as to whether this is something we should check or even be concerned about if it is 'On'. 2) The most common time to find this light 'On'; is during the first flight of the day preflight which is usually at an outstation. Due to the difficulty of getting Maintenance to the Outstation and the likelihood of a lengthy delay; it is difficult to convince myself; much less the Captain; that we should report the problem at the Outstation. This is the second time in the last two months I have delayed reporting the light 'On' to avoid delay at the Outstation. This is the first time out of six previous that required more than a simple cleaning of the detector. [Recommend that] clear guidelines for how the flight crew should react to the chip detector being 'On'; would prevent this in the future!,,,,A First Officer reports departing with the Left-Hand (LH) Chip Detector Light illuminated on their CRJ-200 aircraft. Maintenance at a downline Station found enough debris in chip detector to remove aircraft from service. Pilot noted that unclear guidance on chip detector light and on-time departure pressures were contributors.,"The incident involved a First Officer who reported that the Left-Hand (LH) Chip Detector Light was illuminated during the preflight inspection of their CRJ-200 aircraft. After discussing the issue with the Captain, they decided to divert to ZZZ1 due to concerns about potential delays at the outstation. Upon arrival, Maintenance discovered sufficient debris in the chip detector, leading to the aircraft being removed from service for oil system flushing and reinspection. Contributors to the incident included the lack of clear guidelines for flight crew regarding the chip detector light, which is not part of the standard preflight inspection. The First Officer noted that the light frequently illuminated during the first flight of the day at outstations, and the difficulty of obtaining timely Maintenance support at remote locations compounded the decision to delay reporting. This was the second occurrence in two months, with the first five instances requiring only a simple cleaning of the detector. To prevent future occurrences, the First Officer recommended the establishment of clear guidelines for flight crew actions when the chip detector light is illuminated, aiming to address confusion and reduce the risk of similar incidents.",fume/smoke incident

I omitted stating that we had checked overhead panels; floors and the Electrical Equipment (E/E) compartment and had found no evidence of water.  Also; while talking with the crew; they stated that ZZZ had lots of rain the night before; and lots of condensation that morning in the aircraft. I believe that any water that came from the overhead area of the aircraft was the result of condensation in the aircraft Air Ventilation System.    Due to the discussions we had that day; I believed that the statement about water coming from the overhead areas was more of information into the discrepancy that needed to be investigated and not a discrepancy itself that needed to be addressed; in the action taken block in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook (AML).  Don't assume any information in the [Logbook] Discrepancy block doesn't need to be addressed in the [Logbook's] Action Taken block.,,,,A Line Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT) explains why he did not state in a Logbook sign-off that he had also checked the cabin overhead panels; floors and the E/E compartment for evidence of water intrusion after he had Removed and Replaced (R/R) a Battery Charger.

A Flight Attendant reported water coming from the overhead area, prompting an investigation. Circuit breakers L5, X25, Z24, and the Ground Service Bus were found inoperative, though other electrical systems functioned normally. The Line Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT) addressed the issue by replacing the Battery Charger per the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM), resetting the circuit breakers, and conducting operational checks, which were normal. The AMT did not document checking the overhead panels, floors, or E/E compartment for water in the logbook's Action Taken block, as no evidence of water intrusion was found. The AMT believed the water was likely due to condensation from rain and humidity the previous night. Despite this, the AMT emphasized that the logbook's Discrepancy block should not be assumed to require no action in the Action Taken block.

Corrective action had been taken; including replacing a temperature controller. We also could not control the pack valves with the temperature controllers in auto or manual. At cruise altitude; the left pack ran full hot and resulted in a duct overheat. The overheat produced a strong hot ducting smell in the cabin before it tripped and cooled off. The passengers and Flight Attendants were briefly alarmed and both pilots donned O2 masks and accomplished the Smoke/Fumes Checklists until we were sure the incident was from the duct overheat. Good air quality was regained and we continued to our destination. Here is the error that led to the overheat and smell: We discovered in the next few minutes of flight that the temperature controllers were cross wired. The left [temp selector] controlled the right pack valve and the right controlled the left pack valve. We caused the duct overheat by moving the right [temp selector] to manual hot to unstick a full cold right valve; but this caused the left valve to run full hot. Attempts to cool the left side with the left [temp selector] only kept the right full cold. When Maintenance replaced the temperature controller they failed to verify it was hooked up properly. A simple check with the APU running would have allowed them to confirm left to left and right to right.[There was] uncontrollable air conditioning due to Maintenance error. When replacing systems that are identical and parallel; Maintenance needs to ensure they are not cross wired. A Functional Test of the system controller should be required before the item is signed off.,Reporter stated he had a lengthy discussion with one of their mechanics after the flight arrival in order to give Maintenance a clear picture of the temperature control problems were. The Packs did respond to their Temperature Selector positions; once he and the First Officer figured out what was going on with the Left and Right Selectors. The gate Mechanic went up and checked the Canon plug connectors for the Temperature Selectors and found them cross-connected.,,,A Captain reports about uncontrollable air conditioning high temperatures at cruise altitude on a B737-500 caused by Maintenance error. Crew could not control pack temperatures with temperature selectors in auto or manual. Temperature controller had been replaced earlier; a Functional Check was not performed. New controller was found to be cross-wired.,"The incident involved a B737-500 aircraft experiencing uncontrollable high temperatures in the cabin during cruise altitude. The issue arose due to a maintenance error when replacing the temperature controller. The replacement was not properly tested, resulting in the temperature controllers being cross-wired. This caused the left pack to run at full heat, leading to a duct overheat and a strong smell in the cabin. The crew donned oxygen masks and followed smoke/fumes checklists to resolve the situation, after which normal air quality was restored, and the flight continued to its destination. The proposed solution is to conduct a functional test of the system controller before signing off on such maintenance tasks to prevent similar incidents.",fume/smoke incident

The Flight Attendant then attempted to remove power from the light; and being unable to do so; she then made the decision to employ and discharge a quick shot of halon in the associated light socket. I had asked the Captain if any warnings; cautions; or smoke alarms were activated on the EICAS or the lower lobe crew rest facility. He stated that there were no indications of any sort. Additionally there was no evidence of smoke permeating into the cabin and none of the passengers in the area of the rest facility reported smoke to the flight attendants who were on duty.,,The reading light in a B777's lower level crew rest area emitted a puff of smoke which a Flight Attendant then shot with halon.

Upon noticing this, the attendant discharged a halon fire extinguisher on the light fixture and promptly informed the cockpit. The captain acknowledged the situation and requested the attendant to turn off the light, though she was unable to do so. There were no alarms triggered in either the crew rest area or the cockpit, and subsequent investigation by the purser confirmed that the issue had been resolved. As a precaution, all flight attendants evacuated the lower lobe crew rest area. The captain then contacted maintenance, who recommended removing the faulty bulb. This was executed without complications. Maintenance logged a report regarding the incident, including the halon discharge. Both maintenance and dispatch concurred with the captain's decision to proceed to the planned destination.

I noted he was very excited; speaking with a difficult to understand accent; and coughing. I got out of my seat to look through the cockpit door peephole and witnessed the front several rows of passengers reaching for their masks and covering their mouths to breath. The First Officer declared an emergency with ATC and we immediately diverted to the nearest suitable airport. Total descent time was approx. 6-7 minutes. After landing it was determined that the fumes had decreased and the air had cleared. We taxied to the gate; deplaned and notified company of our location and situation.,Reporter stated that four passengers were taken to the hospital for examination and were released. Later investigation determined that a single passenger; an employee of another airline; had smelled something 'unusual' and decided to unilaterally access her PSU manually to obtain oxygen masks for herself and a companion. Doing so actuated the oxygen generator; alarmed other passengers; who attempted to access masks for themselves; engaged the concern of the Flight Attendants who attempted to assist them in accessing their oxygen masks; which resulted in more O2 generators being activated; more heat generated and the generation of a white haze; a by-product of the high heat emitted by the generators.  By the time the Cabin Attendants advised the Flight Crew the air at the top of the cabin was; indeed; full of 'smoke'; the passengers were scrambling to access their masks and the reporting Flight Attendant was alarmed and wearing a portable O2 mask while attempting to transmit on the interphone. The combined effect when viewed through the cockpit peep hole was of a near panic situation with visible smoke in the cabin.  The result was the declaration of the emergency and the diversion to the nearest suitable airport.,,,An A319 declared an emergency and diverted due to smoke in the cabin.,"The incident occurred when an A319 aircraft experienced the automatic deployment of oxygen masks in the front cabin section due to toxic fumes and haze.
