Ultimately; I failed to notify either Operations in ZZZ or the Captain. Upon reflection during the flight and; as not to create an 'issue;' I realized that I had failed to handle the situation correctly. In an effort to not continue the risk; upon arrival in ZZZ1; I spoke with the Operations Agent and explained the situation and asked if it could be corrected. The Operations Agent indicated to me that the passenger's bags would be pulled prior to their connecting flight. I then spoke to the passenger(s) and asked them to speak with the Operations Agent. Self-realization that each of us is critically responsible for the safety of our crew; our passengers and our assets. That it is not an issue to stop what is currently happening and address it at the time. To hope that if you do make an error that by handling it at the time; that you will not be perceived differently by the crew. Is it possible that checked baggage be screened for items such as lithium batteries; thereby reducing the factor of human error?,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported failing to notify the appropriate parties before departure after learning about a passenger's checked bag that may have potentially contained lithium batteries. After arriving; the reporter notified an Operations Agent to deal with the bag's contents.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who was informed by a passenger that their checked luggage contained an electric razor and a camera, potentially housing lithium batteries. The attendant initially failed to notify Operations or the Captain, possibly due to uncertainty about the items. Upon realizing the oversight, the attendant informed an Operations Agent upon arrival, leading to the passenger's bags being pulled before their connecting flight. The attendant reflected on the importance of safety and suggested enhancing procedures to reduce human error through better screening of checked baggage for lithium batteries.",between attendant and passengers

Two passengers; the one I was talking to; and another let me know that they had laptops in their bags. I let the A-FA know what was going on so that he could help monitor what was going on; and the passengers went to the front of the plane to retrieve their laptops. I let the CA and Gate Agent know what was going on when I was able to make it to the front of the plane because the passengers had come back down the aisle and said the Ramp person; or someone; had told them the cargo hold was closed and they weren't going to get them. It's my understanding that all laptops and lithium batteries need to be taken out and are unable to go in that cargo area; so that is when I spoke with the Captain and Gate Agent. The Captain said we would wait. The passengers then came back again and said the CA said that it was ok to go due to the size and them being off. I checked with the CA one last time and he deemed it safe. I was not there for the conversation when they declared it safe; so I can only go with the CA telling me it is safe.If something was deemed safe by the CA then I go with that; but just everyone checking bags beforehand; Gate Agents and also ramp crew not saying no due to potentially just not wanting to get the bag. But if it's declared safe; it's declared safe.,,,,ERJ-170 Flight Attendant reported to the Captain and Gate Agent that two passenger bags with laptops that had lithium-ion batteries were mistakenly gate checked in cargo during boarding. The Captain then deemed it safe to not remove as the devices were off and approved gate departure.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) who identified two gate-checked bags containing laptops with lithium-ion batteries during boarding. The flight attendant informed the other flight attendant and the captain about the situation, as these items are prohibited in cargo holds due to safety regulations. Two passengers confirmed they had laptops in their bags, and they retrieved them after being instructed to do so. However, the passengers reported that ground personnel had initially prevented them from retrieving the laptops, stating the cargo hold was closed.

She approached me in the back and insisted there was space for her bag and that she wanted to bring it on board. I suggested she speak to the speak to the A-FA in the front and see if it was possible. Once she went back to the front and saw the ramp agent threw her bag down; she approached me again and began yelling at me demanding an explanation for the other flight attendants refusal. I explained that it's protocol for any tagged bag to be sent to cargo. She returned to her seat after our discussion. It wasn't until we were inflight and I was doing beverage service that I noticed she was filling out a complaint form to company. I saw her writing but I continued with my duties and asked if she wanted anything to drink or a snack. She looked at me; noted my name and requested water. After I finished service; I started to reorganize my galley for the next flight. However; I heard several overhead bins opening simultaneously which concerned me. I discovered that the passenger had opened them and was taking photos of all the empty bins. I needed to prioritize securing my galley so I focused on the safety in the back. Once I finished; I checked to see if the passenger was still standing in the aisle but she had returned to her seat. I called the A-FA to inform her about the passengers actions and we both agreed to notify the Captain. The A-FA also mentioned another issue involving a different passenger who had allegedly checked a bag containing lithium batteries and medication. I then updated the Captain about the upset passenger regarding her checked bag.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported a passenger misconduct and an unrelated issue of a passenger who allegedly checked a bag with lithium battery. The Captain was notified of both issues with no additional information provided.,"The incident occurred on a flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1, involving a passenger (Party2) and a flight attendant (Party1). The cause was the passenger's refusal to check her bag for an international trip, leading to a confrontation. The process began with the passenger insisting her bag fit in the overhead compartment, which the flight attendant redirected to the front attendant. When the passenger was denied, she became upset, yelled at the flight attendant, and filled out a complaint form during the flight. The result was the passenger opening multiple overhead bins and taking photos, prompting the flight attendant to secure the galley and notify the captain. The captain was informed about both this misconduct and a separate issue involving a passenger's bag with lithium batteries.

Right then shocked me of what I just saw. They were charging their e-cigarette in the outlet. My jaw dropped as to what I just witnessed. They asked if that was okay to charge. And I said absolutely not! They comply and puts it away.

It was a busy time in the flight deck where I was trying to manage the safety of the push. The FO answered the call to the flight deck from the cabin while I was talking to the ground crew and ramp was talking to our flight and the flight next to us pushing off the gate. The ramp personnel had left several pieces of ground equipment in the way of our push from X1 and we were trying to find out about getting it moved. As all of that is going on the narrative that myself and the FO got from the FA seemed to be one of more a compliance with the mask policy than one of weight and balance. She told us there was a large child sitting in a seat for which they were ticketed next to their mother and the child was having a hard time wearing the mask. The FA told us that the mother was now saying the child was less than 2. The FA believed that the mother was saying the child was less than 2 to skirt our mask policy and we needed to change the count for weight and balance because the child was an infant. I tried to clarify with the FA about the child because it was not clear to me because she was telling me the child was not listed as an infant; had their own seat; and by the FAs thought it was more about the mask. My thinking was that for the child to have that seat a birth date would have to be listed when that seat was purchased. Previously the FAs and the gate agent had reconciled the count; and the FA thought the child was older than 2; so I elected to leave the weight and balance as it stood. We continued to our destination without further incident.It was a busy time in the flight deck when this issue was brought to my attention. After things had calmed down with push I should have checked back with the FA to make sure I was hearing everything she was trying to tell me. Factors for me with my decision making were the high workload at the time; alertness because of the late time of day of the departure and having been scheduled with early AM shows for the three days prior to this event.,,I walked through to do my cabin count and confirmed that I had a child in row XX just as it showed on the sheet. I had already asked the mom to get a mask on the child before we closed the weight/balance. She said the child did not have a mask so I brought her one. After the safety demo I walked through the cabin again for final compliance and saw the child was not wearing a mask. Mom said he had ripped it so I offered to get a new one. She then said that the other FA told her he didn't need one if he was under the age of 2. I was surprised to hear the child was an infant as he was quite large and had walked on board the aircraft by himself. I asked if he was still only 1 and she said he was not yet 2. I alerted the CA that I had possibly made a mistake in the count.  I mistakenly counted an infant as a child. I didn't ask how old the child was; it only came up because of non-compliance with mask policy.I honestly think she claimed the child was an infant in order to avoid dealing with the face mask.In the future I will make sure to ask passengers with small children if they are in fact under the age of 2.,,Air carrier Captain and a Flight Attendant reported a passenger's child was resisting wearing a face mask. After this problem started the parent then stated the child was under 2 and did not need to wear the face mask.,"The incident began when a flight attendant reported a passenger's child resisting the face mask policy. The mother claimed the child was under two years old, exempting the child from the mask requirement. The flight attendant believed this was an attempt to avoid compliance and sought to adjust the weight and balance count. The captain, managing a busy pushback and fatigued from early morning hours, decided to maintain the current count, as the child had a designated seat, suggesting the child was over two. Later, the flight attendant realized she had miscounted the child as a passenger rather than an infant, leading her to alert the captain. She concluded the mother had falsely claimed the child's age. Reflecting on the experience, the flight attendant vowed to verify the age of children in such situations in the future. The outcome was resolved without further incident, with the flight attendant learning to ask passengers about their child's age to ensure accurate counts and compliance.",between attendant and passengers

Also that that passenger was telling people at the gate of having had the virus already. On top of that I was told this passenger had a medical problem they were traveling to ZZZ to be worked on. I was also hearing that passenger was being disruptive.One of my flight attendants had a concern of this passenger still being contagious and being a disruptive passenger. With the passenger still being at the gate I started to receive more information I was told to contact MedLink. Turns out that the gate had already been in touch with MedLink and the passenger had already been cleared by MedLink. As for the pre-existing medical condition; the passenger told the gate of not wearing a mask because it causes asthma attacks. I verified this to be a possibility with MedLink on my side.As for the disruptive behavior I spoke with the station manager and he informed me that the passenger was being cooperative and only just understandably a little frustrated. I asked him if he thought passenger would be an issue in flight and he indicated that he did not believe that to be the case. After speaking with my flight attendant about her concerns we decided they had all been resolved and we allowed the passenger to board the flight. I think this is new to all of us and I don't think I could do anything different.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a series of miscommunications regarding a boarding passenger who was possibly contagious with COVID-19.

The flight attendant expressed concerns about the passenger being contagious and potentially disruptive.

After resolving concerns, the passenger was allowed to board. The outcome was the passenger boarding the flight following the resolution.",between attendant and passengers

I knocked on the aft lavatory; as there was a passenger using it.  'Are you ok?' I asked.  ' Yes. But what's that sound?' She replied as a big plume of smoke/vapor came toward me when she opened the door.[I pointed out that] smoking on an aircraft is a federal offense. So you really don't want to do that. I checked the waste receptacle and the shelves above it. As well as the toilet bowl; sink; and the little cupboard that holds the toilet paper and Kleenex. All clear. It didn't smell like tobacco.I asked the passenger if it was an e-cigarette; she said yes. I let the CA know what happened so he could handle it on his end. The passenger seemed totally taken aback that smoking wasn't allowed on planes and kept repeating that she didn't know it wasn't allowed. Also wearing the personal; disposable face mask made it hard to smell the smoke/vapor plumage that came out of the bathroom. That's why I asked her if it was an e-cigarette. Since I didn't see any smoking device/paraphernalia.As helpful as the personal face masks are for filtering out bacteria and viruses; it's difficult to make out scents fully. But since it was an exhalation of vapor from an e-cigarette it's not like I want to take off the mask to be able to identify the smell due to COVID concerns. That's why a thorough search for any burning or foreign material was done along with asking what she was using.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that the smoke detector alarm was triggered by a passenger smoking an e-cigarette in a lavatory. Flight Attendant stated that wearing a personal face mask made it hard to smell the smoke/vapor plumage to determine whether the smell was due to an e-cigarette or other burning material.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a smoke detector alarm was triggered in the aft galley. A flight attendant noticed the alarm and knocked on the aft lavatory door to check on the passenger inside. Upon opening the door, a plume of smoke or vapor emerged. The flight attendant questioned the passenger about the source of the smoke, explaining that smoking on an aircraft is a federal offense. The passenger claimed she was using an e-cigarette and was unaware that it was prohibited. The flight attendant conducted a thorough search of the lavatory, including the waste receptacle, shelves, toilet bowl, sink, and cupboard, but found no evidence of smoking paraphernalia or burning material. The passenger expressed surprise at the禁烟 policy, attributing her inability to detect the smell to her face mask, which she was wearing for COVID-19 protection.

Upon entering the restroom, Passenger X was heard coughing heavily, to the point of gagging, which worried two other passengers. When asked about his condition, he initially claimed it was due to allergies but later stated he was not feeling well because he had not eaten breakfast. The FA provided snack bags to all passengers and kept a close eye on Passenger X throughout the flight. Additionally, Passenger X was repeatedly reminded to wear his mask properly. The FA noted that he was reading or digging through his bags, which may have contributed to the need for mask reminders. The FA informed the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) about the situation, and the PIC requested that the FA check if there was a way to take Passenger X's temperature. Since the crew did not have a thermometer, the PIC suggested contacting a customer service agent to meet the flight. After landing, the PIC instructed the FA to ask Passenger X to remain seated until all other passengers had deplaned, so that someone could speak with him privately. Passenger X complied but was visibly unhappy and removed his mask in frustration. After noticing the FA's surprise, he quickly put the mask back on.

He then said he will wear his mask. I was told all the above information from the CSA in ZZZ. He has not once put on his mask. When we tell him to put on a mask he says 'I'm still snacking.' As FA B I've been observing and I have yet to see him take a bite of food. He's made his intentions clear that he will not be wearing a mask by him pretending to continue snacking the entire flight. By the middle of the flight he stopped pretending to snack and made it clear he won't be wearing a mask.I confronted the passenger for the last time. Passenger has been told at least 5 times at this point. I've also made many announcements about the mask policy as well. I informed him he needs to put on a mask and that it is policy . Also told him that he was aware of the policy when he purchased the ticket. I had to repeat all that multiple times. He would continue to argue. He said he will not be putting on a mask; that a mask does more harm than good. His wife interrupted and started to argue as well.

He was then asked multiple times through the flight by both FA A & B to put his mask on. He would comply when asked or when we were walking by but would take it off as soon as he thought we could no longer see. I reminded him that it was a policy; he then all at once told me he had some sort of test done and if that wouldn't work what about a medical condition so that he wouldn't haven't to wear the mask. I asked him if he had spoken to a gate agent about it which he threatened me; telling me that I didn't want to go there with him because I wouldn't win.

The passenger initially boarded the plane without a mask but complied after being asked. The passenger was initially rowdy but did not cause significant issues until he began throwing almonds at another passenger. When asked to stop, he complied. However, throughout the flight, the passenger repeatedly removed his mask despite being asked multiple times by the flight attendant and another crew member. When the passenger attempted to argue against wearing the mask, claiming he had a test done and possibly a medical condition, the flight attendant questioned whether he had discussed this with a gate agent. The passenger responded with a threat, implying the flight attendant would not win. The flight attendant then contacted the cabin manager and informed the passenger that the mask policy was non-negotiable, leading to the passenger being met at the gate upon deplaning.

The passenger had a coach seat assignment but had taken a seat in a main cabin extra row. Our #1 FA asked him to move back into an unoccupied seat a few rows back. The passenger got verbally abusive and made physical threats peppered with loud obscene language. Our FAs did not feel safe and specifically because of the physical threats. Over the years I have learned to trust our FAs when it comes to passenger relations. Every time they've flagged a passenger as a potential problem they are almost always correct and the passenger becomes a worse problem airborne. Flying during the COVID pandemic has been stressful; and I believe that may have been a factor. Interacting with masked people is a barrier to clear communication and misunderstandings can easily flare up into confrontations. That being said; our co-workers deserve to be treated with respect and verbal/physical threats will not be tolerated.We have a lot more new customers flying these days due to the decreased fare prices. Customers who have never flown before are unfamiliar with societal rules we crew members take for granted. This can lead to misunderstandings and inappropriate confrontations. Perhaps a simple video guide for new customers to watch before boarding would address passenger expectations? As a long time airline employee it can be difficult to remember how strange the airport/airline environment is to new customers.

The flight attendant emphasized trusting their colleagues' judgment in passenger relations, noting that such incidents often escalate in flight.

They explained they were unable to call an FA because they saw this while standing in the aisle several rows behind these people as all passengers waited to deplane. The two passengers were able to exit the aircraft before the other passengers could notify me. I assured them the plane was terminated and would be sanitized for the evening and we agreed that the only thing remaining we could do about it was to notify Operations and request they inform the cleaners of the location to take extra precautions to protect themselves and to sanitize that area thoroughly. The blood [was] intentionally smeared into an X shape on the wall. I presumed the blood came from tearing open a scab or some other small wound. It was a clearly visible amount but didn't indicate heavy bleeding.By the time [deplaning] was complete and I could go to row XX; most of the moisture from the saliva and nasal secretions had dried and was barely visible; only the blood stood out. Without their notification; and even with the easily visible blood; it would have been impossible to realize the extent to which they had contaminated every possible surface. It would have dried completely had we taken the time to tidy the aircraft first. In our PA about passenger compliance we emphasize seat belts and smoking and perhaps that is outdated and detracts from where the emphasis currently should lie. We state federal law prohibits tampering with a lav smoke detector; perhaps we have a law that prohibits passenger misconduct and could be stated in such a way that explains the criminality (if any) to such behavior.

The flight attendant terminated the flight and informed Operations to request cleaners to sanitize the affected area thoroughly.

I called F/D and let them know of the situation and asked to hold pushback until aft FAs determined whether Passenger X should continue on the flight. Passenger X complied initially and we departed without further issue.During cruise F/A B communicated to me that he had asked Passenger X several times to keep his mask on - as he was not eating or drinking. I went aft and asked Passenger X to wear his mask as well; which he had stuffed into his pocket. He was visibly annoyed and didn't initially comply. As he was connecting on another flight; we also notified pilots of the situation. Passenger X; was non-compliant with face mask.Better policy/procedure is needed between FA; Pilot; and station workgroups and their roles. It doesn't feel particularly safe to send someone who is knowingly non-compliant onto another crew or CSA.,,During boarding I observed Passenger X; without his face mask on and asked him to please pull his mask up; which he did. After the demo as I walked to the back; I observed Passenger X with his face mask down again. I told him to put it up. And then I reminded him that he had agreed to wear a face mask is a condition of flying with us this evening. I told him I was not playing games. I told him; this could jeopardize his ability to fly with this airline in the future. I asked him if he understood and he said he did. Later on; after the service; I was going through the cabin picking up trash and observed Passenger X without a face mask. It was not on his face around his neck. It was nowhere to be seen. I looked him squarely in the face. He saw me looking at him and made no move to put his face mask on again. I called the A FA and told her about [the] issue.

I conveyed what had happed to both FA A and the CA.  Shortly after 10;000 feet as I was heading forward to retrieve a set of headphones for another guest; as I walk by; I find her laying across XX1 and 2 with her head propped up on her book bag on the aisle arm rest; head hanging over into the aisle without a mask.  I tried rousing her quietly with no response from her and then gently tapped her on the shoulder and her exclaiming; 'What?!  What do you want?'  I politely asked her to please put her mask on and cover both her nose and mouth as required and to please ensure her seatbelt remained fastened while the seatbelt sign was on as we were still ascending.  She begrudgingly complied as she continued to complain and others around her asked her to wear it as well.  During service; once again; Passenger X had her mask below her chin as she sat with her foot propped up in the seat and was painting her toenails.  I politely asked her again to comply with the mask requirement and to please not polish her toenails as the fumes were offensive to those around her.  She denied painting her toenails (with polish in an opened [bottle and] nail polish remover pad in hand). I explained to her once again that wearing a mask is a requirement that she had been made aware of prior to boarding and that it wasn't fair to the other passengers and crew on board as everyone else was diligent in complying. I also made her aware that she had been informed several times.  As I started to walk forward to let FA A know what had transpired.  We called the CA and let him know that we were doing and to be prepared in the event that the situation escalated.  The guest in front of her Passenger Y asked if there was something more I could do or move her when suddenly her voice level became elevated and she said 'There!  I pulled the mask up and I have a headache so go away!' Subsequently we (FA A and myself) asked the Passenger Y if he would be more comfortable in another seat and he accepted.  Passenger Y and several other guests commended us for how we handled the situation.  Passenger Y gave his permission for this airline to contact him regarding the situation and events. Passenger X complied for the rest of the flight.  Upon final compliance before landing; Passenger X was asked by both FA A and myself to again stow her bags which she finally did by tossing and kicking them under the seat.  Upon landing she quickly stood; gathered her belongings and hurried off of the plane before rows in front of her stood.  Although we understand the importance of wanting to retain customer loyalty; this kind of behavior should not be tolerated for the sake of one over an entire cabin of guests and employees.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger did not comply with wearing a face mask during flight and exhibited other non-compliant behavior.,"A flight attendant encountered a passenger who repeatedly failed to comply with mask-wearing regulations and other cabin behavior guidelines. The passenger, identified as X, was reminded multiple times before takeoff to stow her belongings and wear her mask. During the flight, Passenger X disregarded these instructions, lying across seats and removing her mask. She also engaged in painting her toenails, despite being asked to stop due to fumes bothering others. When addressed, Passenger X became confrontational, raising her voice and refusing to comply. The flight attendant and crew, including the Chief Attendant, took steps to mitigate the situation, offering alternative seating to affected passengers. Passenger X eventually complied with mask requirements for the remainder of the flight but quickly left the aircraft upon landing.

He then grabbed the mask and broke the string; he said; 'Damn it; I guess I can't wear it now.' I told him we have more masks and went in the back to the galley and grabbed another mask for him. After handing it to him; I left.  Later on in the flight after my final descent announcement; I was passing through the cabin doing my final sweep and saw he was still not wearing the mask. I asked him again to put it on; that it is a requirement to wear a mask while on the aircraft. He told me he can't breathe with it on and unless I had a ventilator he wasn't going to wear it.

I went back and asked passenger if they were in the exit row or did they move and she said she moved because she wanted a window seat. I explained I needed her to move back to her original seat as we had not briefed her for the exit row. I told her I would come back and explain more about why after we got in the air.  She moved back. I went back to my FWD jumpseat and called the Captain to tell him we were secure and passenger was back in her seat. AFT FA made a PA telling passenger of need to keep masks on then told me that same passenger had removed hers. As he walked up during our service in flight he said he thought he noticed a beer bottle on her seat tray. I asked him if he wanted me to check and he said yes. I walked back and there was an open beer bottle can on her tray. I asked her what was in the bottle and asked if it was an X brand beer and alcohol. She said yes and I told her she could not have her alcohol on board.  She asked why but said OK; and I took it and showed the aft FA in the galley then threw it away and immediately called the flight deck. The FO apparently answered and I told him the same passenger that had tried to move in to the exit row and we had a mask issue with had an open beer on her tray that we took from. I told him she did not appear drunk as she was answering my questions clearly and cognitively; but had a little smart attitude.  During the rest of the flight I continued to collect trash in the aisle about every 10 minutes to check on her.

I said yes the Captain would because at that point I wasn't sure what he meant but he had given me eye contact during the flight like he did not know what to think of the passenger.  Another passenger deplaned who had been sitting in A2 was not happy with the passenger either apparently. Passenger in Z4 told the Captain on the jet bridge that she had been saying swear words and how she was going to write a letter to airline and what she was going to do the other FA and I?

The incident resulted in the passenger's refusal to comply with the mask policy, leading to potential consequences such as being banned from future flights. No resolution was explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that the passenger's actions would be addressed by the authorities.",between attendant and passengers

However this was a XX minute flight so I informed the Captain on arrival that there was an issue regarding a noncompliant passenger. He agreed that getting a Supervisor was needed.  I let the agent who met the flight know that we needed a Supervisor. She sent the Station Manager before the deplaning process happened. The Captain made an announcement to re-inform the passengers that masks are required throughout the flight.

My other FA moved the passenger in row XX up so we could move the mother and child towards the back; hoping to make other guests happy; and to avoid complaints about the child not wearing a mask. During compliance; child is still not wearing a mask. FA offers a cookie trying to convince the child to wear a mask. Mother of child informs us she screams and cries when she wears it. Asked Customer Service lead to give a final warning to mother. Was a very uncomfortable situation as we witnessed the mother begin to pull out her phone. Mother was very upset. FA and I tried our best to assure the mother that we realize these times are hard and confusing and we empathize with her for her situation as it was tough for all of us. They both seemed to be happy towards end of flight as we provided snack and beverages to ease the situation.I do not think we should enforce young children to wear masks. Child could possibly have disability and be unable to wear the mask. We are unaware of the family's situation and it is very hard to enforce grown adults to wear masks; let alone young children who don't understand what is going on.,,Passenger came onboard with X-year old child not wearing a mask. Gate agent tells me they were told to put it on and the child was screaming. I go to the back with a cookie and kindly ask if she can put her mask on and the mom tries to put it on and the child refuses. I asked if she is willing to sit in row XX so she wouldn't be near any of the other passengers. I moved passengers that were within 3 rows away from the mom and child. The mom looked stressed and her eyes were red. I know our policy is black and white regarding our process and removing a passenger. I felt like moving the passenger was the best thing to do; as I did not want this to turn into another public nightmare. I also asked if anybody felt uncomfortable with the small child taking the mask off at times while she is sitting far from everybody else and they all agreed it was OK. I told Captain the situation and they called a duty officer on their behalf to clear us to leave. The reason for making the exception made sense. She was at least 3 rows away from the nearest person; we avoided a meltdown; she was getting her camera ready and the bathroom in the back was inop so we knew nobody would go back there. I believe no further action was needed. We got guidance on the full procedure from our pilots and everyone was extremely grateful for a resolution to make everyone happy onboard.We need a better mask policy for children; especially if they might have a disability.,,Flight attendants reported that a child was unable to wear a face mask due to crying; resulting in a stressful situation. The child and parent were reseated and the situation was resolved.,"The incident occurred when a mother and her X-year-old child boarded the aircraft without the child wearing a mask. Despite the gate agents informing the mother that the child needed to wear a mask, the child refused, and the mother was unable to comply due to the child's distress. The flight attendant attempted to resolve the situation by offering a cookie to the child and moving the mother and child to a different seat to minimize discomfort for other passengers. The mother, who appeared stressed and emotional, was empathized with by the flight attendant, who acknowledged the challenges of the situation. The flight attendant also questioned the enforceability of mask policies for young children, especially those who may have disabilities. The situation was ultimately resolved without further action, as the mother and child were reseated away from other passengers, and the flight attendant sought guidance from the captain and duty officer.

The children rang their call button over and over wanting more items.  When the crew would approach we'd have to ask them to put their mask on.  We had repeated interactions with this whole family.  Again; most times their mask was off or not covering their nose.  PA's were made to remind guests of our mask policy.  They blatantly disregarded under the guise of drinking; or a few members would go by to gather trash they might put it on but take it off the moment we passed with trash.  This is a safety risk to others onboard and crew. They should not be allowed to fly with us if they cannot follow the CDC guidelines for everyone's safety.

After boarding was complete and the door was closed I did all my walk throughs and everything was good. While up in the air I did my service announcement which is telling passengers that I won't be doing a service and that a mask must be worn during the entire flight; I did the mask announcement twice before departure and while in the air...I just sat during the flight until it was time to do the final approach announcement. I walked back to collect any garbage and I noticed that he was sleeping and did not have his mask on. I kindly told him again that he needed to have his mask on. He put it on and I kept walking. The same passenger that had notified me the first time that he didn't have a mask is a Company X employee. She showed me her badge and said that he hadn't had his mask the entire flight and that she would report the flight because I did not do anything. I told her that that was OK. I walked back to the galley; threw out the trash and walked back to do my compliance check and the passenger had removed his mask I told him that he needed to put it on again this time more strictly. I walked to my jumpseat and got ready for landing. While deplaning this passenger did not have his mask on. I'm not sure what I was supposed to do in this situation.

During boarding and after takeoff; all required announcements including the announcement regarding the wearing of face masks were made.  As I took meal orders; I observed the Passenger X; [was] not wearing a face mask.  I advised her of the mask policy when I took her lunch preference.After takeoff; I once again observed that she was not wearing her mask.  The primary service was being served; so I decided I would monitor her for compliance once the meal service was complete.As I did a final pickup; I once again observed Passenger X not in compliance with the mask policy.  She was sitting in her seat; not consuming any food or beverages; and her mask was laying next to her seat. I made an additional PA regarding the mandatory mask policy hoping she would hear the PA and comply.  I waited approximately 10-15 minutes to see if she would wear her mask.   I approached her and said; 'Hello again; I'm the purser on today's flight.  I know I reminded you earlier about the mask; please understand that it is a requirement that it be worn unless you are actively eating food or drinking a beverage.'  She rolled her eyes and said; 'I am drinking;' as she held an empty blue plastic cup at her chin.  I explained to her that I had observed her not wearing the mask since prior to takeoff and that I needed her to comply for everyone's safety.  As I turned to walk away; she took the mask and threw it in the aisle. I looked at the manifest and discovered that Passenger X was a non-revenue passenger.I contacted the cockpit to advise the Captain of the situation.  The Captain advised me to inform Passenger X that she must comply with the mask wearing policy.  If she refused; he was going to have the aircraft met upon arrival in ZZZ1.  I retrieved one of the mask policy slips that explains the mask policy and once again approached Passenger X.  I asked her to confirm her last name as I wanted to be certain that it was truly her occupying seat XA.  She confirmed her identity as well as confirmed that she was traveling as a non-revenue passenger.  I gave her the form and explained in great detail that failure to comply with the mask policy would likely result in severe disciplinary action. I explained that the policy is mandatory and that the Captain wanted me to inform her that failure to comply would result in the aircraft being met upon arrival in ZZZ1.  She had requested more alcohol to drink so I informed her that the Captain and I had made the decision to not serve her anymore alcohol since she was being belligerent.  She put her hand up towards my face; shook her head and said 'really? This is so messed up. %$#%#!  (Yes; she used the %$#%# [language] towards me) The mask that she pushed into the aisle was still there so I had another mask with me as I didn't want her to wear a mask that had been in contact with the floor.  I asked her if she would like a clean mask. She accepted my offer of a mask.  I then informed her that I would pass along to the Captain how she responded.The FO exited the cockpit for a break shortly after my conversation with Passenger X.  FO also observed Passenger X sitting in seat XA without wearing her mask.  I once again contacted the cockpit and advised the Captain that Passenger X was still refusing to comply and that FO also witnessed her being non-compliant. Shortly after FO went on her break; I observed Passenger X put her mask on the right of her seat and pull the blanket up over her head.  She kept her head covered until we prepared the cabin for landing.  As we did final safety checks; I observed her remove the blanket from her head.

Another crew member told me that Mr. A gave him attitude also. At this point I felt that the Captain was not going to give us any support to the situation so I briefed the rest of the flight attendants to not address Mr. A. about wearing his mask so that we would not have a bad situation happen inflight.

I told her please cover your nose and this is the 2nd time I've had to tell you. She then said is this required I said yes it is required. I spoke to the CSA who informed me she is a non-revenue passenger. This made me very uncomfortable. I asked her if she was non-revenue and who she knew at the Airline. She asked me why and I said because you aren't wearing your mask and I need to report it. She refused to give me the name. I honestly didn't feel comfortable having her be seated in first class and on the flight. He said it was up to me to have her off. I decided to let her go. This is unacceptable behavior for a non-revenue passenger.I shouldn't have to feel unsafe or have her argue with me about wearing the mask.

During boarding, the flight attendant noticed the passenger's mask was not covering her nose and advised her to do so. The passenger was later upgraded to first class by the Customer Service Agent (CSA), but again her mask was partially lowered. The flight attendant reminded her twice to cover her nose and mouth, and the passenger questioned whether this was required. The flight attendant informed the CSA, who confirmed the passenger was non-revenue. This made the flight attendant uncomfortable, as she felt the passenger was not complying with the mask policy. The flight attendant asked the passenger for the name of someone she knew at the airline but was refused. The flight attendant considered having the passenger removed from the flight but ultimately decided against it. She expressed her discomfort with the situation and emphasized the importance of mask compliance, suggesting that flight benefits could be revoked for non-compliance.",between attendant and passengers

Although we make the announcements about masks often and model proper behavior; passengers often forget to pull the mask up to cover nose and mouth; letting it rest on chin.  What is especially problematic is that when I am serving; many pull it down and talk right at my face.  I step back and ask and motion to them to pull it up but often they seem confused.  This happens many many times on each flight.   Merely making announcements doesn't seem to do the trick.  Serving does not feel safe for me as a result.  It may seem like a silly idea; but what about a role play with the two flight attendants after takeoff in front of cabin to demonstrate not to pull down mask?  Sort of like the safety demo; with a set script where the one pretends to pull down mask and the other says 'Please don't do that!'It's worth a try.  It could stick in people's heads better with a demo; based on teaching techniques.,,,,Flight Attendant reported problems associated with passengers wearing face masks improperly.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and passengers regarding improper face mask usage during a flight. The flight attendant reported that passengers frequently failed to wear masks correctly, with some pulling them down to talk while she was serving. Despite repeated announcements and reminders, this issue persisted, creating a sense of unsafe working conditions for the flight attendant. As a proposed solution, the flight attendant suggested a role play demonstration after takeoff, where two flight attendants would simulate the proper use of masks, similar to the safety demo, to help passengers better understand the importance of mask adherence. The flight attendant expressed a desire for this approach to be considered to address the recurring issue.",between attendant and passengers

Announcement was reiterated to remain seated. He sat back down but did not put seatbelt back on until he was approached to do so. During service; he was again; not wearing mask. I told him to put it on and he complied. During walk through; his seatbelt was once again off while the seatbelt sign was on. He had to be asked again to put it on. He wasn't happy about it but complied. After the cabin had been secured for landing and the cabin had been secured for anticipated turbulence; he took his mask back off.  At that point; it was turbulent and unsafe for us to get up. The other FA had to motion for him to put the mask back on. He complied but the mask continued to come off and we continued to motion to put it back on. After gear came down; the passenger got up (in moderate turbulence and on final approach) and moved seats. We made an announcement for him to be seated immediately. He did not stay in his original seat; but ultimately moved to a different seat anyways.Upon landing; the other FA told him moving when he did was absolutely unsafe and completely unacceptable. He just got off the airplane.  The passenger got up in turbulence on final approach after gear came down and moved seats despite being told not to. It was unsafe to make him move back to seat for weight and balance.This passenger had a complete disregard for safety and was incredibly non compliant. While all little non compliant moments at first; it continued until he did something that was truly dangerous to the people sitting near him. Not only was he non compliant with our mask policy but his reckless behavior in moving around during turbulence after being told not to could have easily injured those around him. He shouldn't be allowed to travel with us in the future.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger was non compliant with face mask policy and also changing seats while in turbulence and on final approach.,"The incident involved a passenger who demonstrated multiple instances of non-compliance with the flight's mask policy and safety procedures. The passenger initially failed to wear a mask upon boarding and required repeated reminders from the flight attendant to do so. During the flight, the passenger also disregarded the seatbelt sign and did not properly secure his seatbelt on multiple occasions. Additionally, during turbulence on final approach, the passenger moved seats despite being instructed to remain seated, which posed a safety risk. The flight attendant reprimanded the passenger for this behavior upon landing, and the passenger was subsequently prohibited from flying with the airline in the future due to his disregard for safety protocols.",between attendant and passengers

When we went to go by with the final trash service before landing; we noticed he again was not wearing his mask at all and not actively eating or drinking. I went up to him and informed him that we need him to wear his mask and it needs to be over his nose and mouth as part of the policy. He then informed me that he had a medical issue preventing him from wearing the mask. I let him know that it has been a policy that every person flying must wear their mask over their nose and mouth and that I didn't want to report him which would suspend his travel privileges with us. He looked at me very annoyed and said 'well if I hold my water bottle; I cannot wear my mask; right?' I let him know that our policy is to wear your mask when not actively eating or drinking. So if he isn't drinking; he needs to be wearing his mask. I let him know that if he has a medical condition; then he may need to fly with a different carrier for the time being and that if he had a return flight; he would need to comply. He then took his mask off; and started to actively drink his water slowly so he didn't have to wear it. We were about to land; and at that point it was too late to give him another warning.

She shook her head and said 'Whatever.' I politely informed her of policy concerning wearing a face covering throughout her journey and offered her a complimentary mask. She appeared to be searching for her personal mask in her purse and refused a complimentary mask and walked away.After the boarding process was totally complete; the Ops Agent confirmed with me that all of the passengers were onboard.I proceeded to make the All Passengers Onboard PA. Afterward; I closed a few forward overhead bins a concerned passenger informed me that when she went to the aft lavatory; the passenger who came onboard without a face covering had taken it off. I thanked the concerned passenger and reminded her that the mask can be briefly removed for eating or taking medicine and also; thanked her for bringing it to my attention.Because; it was bought to my attention. I proceeded to address the passenger who boarded without a face covering and noticed once again that she was not complying and was not wearing a face covering. I politely approached her and kindly asked her to comply with airline policy and to put on her mask. Before; I could say anything else she immediately interrupted me and her tone of voice became aggressive toward me. In her aggressive tone of voice; she said: 'What! You got a problem with me.' I said no ma'am and quietly walked away. Because; she was not wearing a mask and her tone of voice elevated and she became aggressive. I did not want any potential traveling droplets to make contact with my eyes. Therefore; I quietly walked away. At this point; we were still at the gate and I knew I only had a short window to have the non-complaint passenger addressed concerning her not wearing a face covering.Therefore; I went to inform the Captain but he was in the lavatory. Also; I knew the Ops Agent had confirmed with me that boarding was complete. Then; I asked the C-Flight Attendant to stand at the forward entry; so; I could notify the Ops Agent for the appropriate Ground Operations or Supervisor to address the non-complaint passenger then I returned back to the aircraft.When the Ground Operations or Supervisor(s) arrived; I remained in the forward entry while they talked to the non-complaint passenger. I am not sure what she told them or what they said to her; but she and someone traveling with her were escorted off the aircraft. After; they deplaned. The Ops Agent said goodbye and closed the door.   With the world-wide spread of the coronavirus that could potentially spread through respiratory droplets; from person-to-person. In my mind; I was thinking this is a precaution COVID concern for the health and safety of the wellbeing of every passenger and crew member onboard and the best time to address policy is before we pushed back or have to return back to the gate because of a non-compliant passenger who was not wearing a face covering. The Captain was in the lavatory; the boarding process was totally complete and confirmed by the Ops Agent that the last person had boarded the aircraft. I had made the All Passengers Onboard PA. The concerned passenger was watching me after I spoke to the non-complaint passenger to see what I was going to do about the issue. I wanted to be proactive and take precaution; before closing the forward entry door; or possibly having to return back to the gate with a potentially bigger problem. The forward exits were monitored by Flight Attendant C. The aft exits were monitored by Flight Attendant B. When I returned back to the aircraft both Flight Attendants were visible to the passengers.In closing; for the safety; health; and wellbeing ofall of our passengers; the crew; and myself; I am committed to upholding airline policy and value every customer; their concerns; their health; their safety; their wellbeing; their business; and their flight experience when they board our aircraft.I believe it would be helpful if someone from ground operations could be visually within reach; for at least the last ten minutes before departure; to address or assist with any matter that may occur onboard or during the remaining minutes before departure time.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger was removed due to non-compliance with face mask policy.,"During the boarding process, a flight attendant noticed a passenger without a face mask. The passenger was asked to wear a mask but refused, leading the attendant to let her board under surveillance. Later, another passenger reported that the woman had removed her mask in the lavatory. The attendant approached her again, but the passenger became aggressive. The attendant then sought assistance from ground operations, resulting in the passenger and her companion being escorted off the aircraft before departure. This incident highlights the importance of enforcing face mask policies to ensure passenger and crew safety.",between attendant and passengers

They removed those during flight and put on white mask with a filter valve that had hose connected to it and the other end connected a powered air filter that hung around their necks. When I talked with both of them I advised them they could not use the air filter or a mask with a valve. He began to argue that he called reservations and was told it was fine. He then demanded for me to show him where it said that. I pulled up the face mask information with no valves he took picture of page. At that point passenger took her mask off and replaced it with the neck/face mask she wore on boarding but he did not. When he was ready to deplane he changed mask he was wearing back to the neck/face mask he had originally worn as he boarded.,,,,Flight Attendant reported passengers wearing non-approved face masks.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and a passenger regarding the use of face masks on board an aircraft. The passenger, who had initially boarded the flight wearing a neck/face mask, removed it during the flight and switched to a white mask with a filter valve. This mask was connected to a powered air filter that the passenger wore around their neck. The flight attendant advised the passenger that they could not use the mask with a valve or the air filter, as these were not approved for use on the aircraft. The passenger disputed this, claiming they had been told by reservations that it was acceptable. The attendant attempted to resolve the issue by showing the passenger the airline's policy on face masks, which explicitly prohibited the use of masks with valves. The passenger took a photo of the policy but continued to use the unapproved mask. During the interaction, the passenger's companion complied by switching back to their original neck/face mask, but the passenger did not. As the flight neared its end, the passenger removed the unapproved mask and switched back to their original neck/face mask before deplaning. The flight attendant documented the incident as a report of passengers wearing non-approved face masks. No formal resolution was reached, and the passenger ultimately refused to comply with the attendant's instructions, resulting in a delay in the departure process.",between attendant and passengers

I was busy greeting passengers as they walked through; and telling people who sat in the exit row that they were seated in the exit row; and verifying they were willing to sit there.  One woman was not responding to me; and I realized she could not hear me.  She said her ears were blocked from the last landing; and they had not cleared. Since she was unable to hear or respond to my questions; I told her I would have to re-seat her.  A gentleman in the exit row loudly said she was sick; and should not be allowed on the plane.  I asked her if she was sick; and she said no.  She appeared to be congested; which is likely the reason her ears blocked on landing.  I had her trade seats with another passenger; briefed the exit row and secured the forward cabin from the exit row forward.  When I got to the front; I informed A the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure.  I did not hear a PA that the aft cabin was secure. I informed the A that the woman I moved from the exit row could not hear; that she was congested but said she was not sick.  The A said she did not appear sick or have any COVID symptoms when she boarded. I said congestion could be a COVID symptom; and A seemed surprised; and said she never heard that.  By then operations was in front with us; and he and A said all I was required to do was ask if they are sick; and if the response is no; then we leave it alone.  I did not know if the passenger had allergies; a cold; or something more serious.The A was doing her final walk through prior to takeoff; and noticed a child seat directly behind the exit row. Someone notified the Captain; and A and D quickly had passengers change rows. The captain rang; I answered; and he asked if they were finished. I said I was C in front; and they were not quite done.

While conducting her duties, she was occupied with greeting passengers and ensuring that those seated in the exit row were willing to assume the responsibilities of that seat. A passenger in the exit row exhibited hearing difficulties, as she was unable to respond to the flight attendant's instructions. The passenger explained that her ears were blocked due to a prior landing, leading to congestion but not indicating that she was sick. The flight attendant attempted to reseat the passenger in accordance with safety protocols, but a gentleman seated nearby objected, claiming the passenger was sick and should not be on the plane. The passenger denied being sick, though her congestion raised concerns about potential COVID-19 symptoms. The flight attendant consulted with the captain and operations, who advised her that if the passenger was not explicitly sick or exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, she could remain on the plane. The flight attendant proceeded with reseating the passenger and securing the forward cabin. The incident was resolved after the flight attendant successfully completed the seat change and informed the captain that the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure. The flight attendant did not hear a public address (PA) confirming the aft cabin was secure but ultimately ensured the situation was managed.",between attendant and passengers

Risking employee lives over a beverage/food service contradicts safety guidelines.,,,,Flight Attendant reported the majority of passengers were not complying with face mask policy.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and other parties, likely passengers, during a flight. The flight attendant reported that the majority of passengers were not complying with the face mask policy, as 95% had their masks removed while the attendant was collecting trash and providing food and beverage service. Passengers were observed talking, eating, and requesting items without their masks on, despite numerous announcements reminding them to wear masks during service. The flight attendant highlighted that enforcing safety guidelines, such as maintaining a 6-foot distance and ensuring mask compliance, was challenging and often impossible during food and beverage service. The attendant expressed concerns about prioritizing passenger comfort and convenience over safety, emphasizing the need to protect front-line employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reported incident underscores the risks faced by flight attendants when balancing service duties with safety protocols. A proposed solution, as implied by the flight attendant, is to prioritize employee safety over food and beverage service, aligning with established safety guidelines.",between attendant and passengers

During boarding for the Passenger X was the last passenger to board. He came on with a mask in his hand. I was the A Flight Attendant (FA) and informed him of the mask requirement. I told him; 'The mask must be on for boarding and remain on the entire flight covering your nose and mouth.' He put his paper mask on and asked where his seat was since he couldn't remember. I looked up his seat number and it was XX4. After he sat down he took his mask off again according to the aft flight attendants. FA1 and FA2 both instructed him to put his mask on covering his nose and mouth. He complied when asked; but then removed it again during walk through before takeoff. FA1 came forward and told me about taking his mask off again. He said he lost his mask so she brought him a new one from our kit and he put it on. After takeoff during service he again had his mask off. The aft flight attendants again told him he must cover his nose and mouth.After discussing his non-compliance repeatedly with the COVID-19 mask policy we decided the next time he had it off we would issue a final warning. About an hour before landing in ZZZ a couple [of] passengers came forward to complain about a man not wearing his mask at all. I went back to talk to him and it was Passenger X in XX4 again. He was making those around him uncomfortable and they said he would take the mask off as soon at the flight attendants would walk away. I issued him a warning and explained to him that this was his final warning about not wearing his mask. He said he lost his mask again. I went and got him a new mask out of the flight attendant kit and explained again that it must cover his nose and mouth. I instructed him to read the policy and that if he violated the mask policy again he would be reported and banned from flying on our airline. He put on his new mask and acknowledged that he understood. During final descent as I was sitting in my jumpseat and Passenger X leaned in the aisle and removed his mask. During taxi to the gate he stood up and started walking. I got on the PA and said 'Please; remain in your seat with seatbelts fastened with masks covering nose and mouth.' He sat down but did not put his mask on. Passengers around him were shaking their heads.We didn't call to the gate for him to be met because we were almost there. When we reached the gate I informed the Customer Service Agent (CSA) about the situation. The CSA asked if we wanted the police; but we decided that since we were ready to deplane it wouldn't help. The Captain pointed Passenger X out as he was deplaning with no mask. He said that Passenger X was the same passenger that was an issue on his previous flight for not wearing a mask.  As Passenger X passed me during deplaning I explained that since he was not compliant to COVID-19 policies and our mask mandate he was getting reported as I warned he would during the flight. He just laughed and kept walking. He violated our COVID-19 mask policies repeatedly even with several warnings.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger refused to adhere to face mask policy.,"The incident involved a passenger, identified as Passenger X, who repeatedly failed to comply with the airline's COVID-19 face mask policy during a flight. The flight attendant (Party1) instructed Passenger X multiple times to wear his mask, as required by company and CDC guidelines. Despite initial compliance, Passenger X removed his mask several times during the flight, including after being provided with a new mask by the flight attendant. The flight attendant issued a final warning to Passenger X, explaining that further non-compliance would result in reporting and potential banning from the airline. Despite this, Passenger X continued to remove his mask, including during final descent and after being reminded to keep his mask on as the plane taxied to the gate. The flight attendant reported the situation to the Customer Service Agent upon arrival, and the passenger was warned that he would be reported for violating the mask policy.

I went to first class to talk to the A FA and she was talking to the passenger in X6. She asked the man how old his child was; he said 2 years and X months old. FA A informed him the child is required to wear a mask. The man then said the child was under 2.  The issue now was the child under 2 was seated in [his own seat]. (The father had purchased a seat for the child); I recommended that we just move the father and child to the row behind them. The couple seated in Y 1 and 3 were the grandparents so the father and child switched seats with them.I returned to the aft of the aircraft. I was later informed by FA A that the agents told her the child was over 2 years old. Throughout the flight I was in the first class cabin and the child never had a mask on. ALSO!! When I was doing my demo the grandmother who was seated in X6 did not have her nose covered. I asked her very kindly to cover her nose and she rolled her eyes and gave a big huff but did cover her nose. I was called to guard the flight deck door and she once again did not have her nose covered. I explained that she needed to cover her nose; once again she objected but complied. Only the First Officer (FO) used the lavatory and in that short time I had to ask her at least 4 times to cover her nose. She was so rude and resistant. I finally told her that I wouldn't stand guard if she didn't keep her mask on. The FO came out of the lavatory; I explained to the FO what was going on; the woman saw me talking to the FO and put her mask over her nose. FA A finally gave the father a warning. Other than the mom and Grandpa this family was seldom; the 2 year old Child never did wear a mask; in compliance with our Mask policy.   The child was 2 years that is why the father purchased a seat. Both parents lied about the age of the child when they found out the child was required to wear a mask. Which then required us to move the child from X4.,,There's a family of four adults (parents and grandparents); a 2 year old and a baby. The 2 year old did not have his face mask on during boarding. I asked the father how old the child was. He said two and two months; I said that he had to have a mask on since he [was] over two.At that time the father said that his son was under two years old. The father grabbed his son and put him on his lap. His son was wiggling and fussing on his lap and finally he fell on the floor and screamed because of pain. He calmed down quickly; and still was sitting on dad's lap. (Later; during the flight the parents found a bleeding scratch on their son's back head and asked for First Aid antiseptic wipes.)The son looked like he was over 2 years old.  I asked the father what was the exact age of his son. He said that [he was] under Two. I had to call CSA and asked her to find out the exact age of the child. She found out that the child was over two years old. At that time I told the father that his son was not an infant; and he had to take his own seat and wear his face mask. The whole family were not happy with that; all the family members claimed the child was under two years old. Mother worried that they had purchased a seat for him and her son had to be on dad's lap. The father attempted to put a face mask on his son and he said that he would do his best to keep a face mask on during the flight. The family swapped seats.CSA came on board and asked if I wanted to remove the child from the flight. The father confirmed he would take all possible attempts to keep a face mask on his son. My decision was to keep the family on board.After 10;000 feet when I was taking the orders I saw that the boy did not have a mask on. I started talking to the father and he became not cooperative and talked to me in a rude manner. He said that his son was drinking water. I reminded him that the mask must be on when not actively eating or drinking. The father responded to me that I had to stay away from them; keep social distance (I did!); do not ask them any questions and do not offer them anything. At that time he actually was trying to make his son drink the water from the bottle in front of me. During the flight I was monitoring the child's compliance. He was watching his iPad and was not wearing a mask. I gave a warning to the father.During the rest of the flight the boy was not compliant. Parents put a bag of crackers in front of him to pretend he was actively eating.During the flight; with no mask on; they went to the lavatory in the aft (the forward lavatory was not operable). When they were coming back from the lavatory through the main cabin I was picking up trash and showed the father with my hands that mask must be on the child. The father ignored my request and just told me not to touch them. I talked to the Captain; explained the situation with the family who were not compliant and tried to hide the age of their child; and asked for a CSA to meet the flight in ZZZ. During demo and at cruising FA B had to ask grandmother to cover her nose many times. The grandmother was rolling her eyes when asked to cover her nose before we could let the pilots take a break. CSA met the flight in ZZZ and I reported the fact of hiding the child's age and the compliance issue to her.,,Flight Attendant crew reported a family did not comply with face mask policy.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (FA B) and a family traveling on a flight. The family included a 2-year-old child who was seated in his own seat but did not wear a face mask, despite the airline's policy requiring masks for children over 2 years old. The father initially claimed the child was under 2 years old, but it was later discovered that the child was over 2 years old. This led to a disagreement over the child's seating and mask compliance. FA B attempted to resolve the issue by suggesting a seat change, but the family was resistant. The father claimed the child was under 2 years old, even after being informed that the child was over 2. The family eventually swapped seats with the grandparents, but the child continued to refuse to wear a mask during the flight. The flight attendant repeatedly warned the father about the mask policy and reported the family's non-compliance to the cabin service assistant (CSA) and the captain. Additionally, the grandmother in the family repeatedly failed to comply with the mask policy, despite being reminded multiple times by the flight attendant. The family's non-compliance with the mask policy and their attempt to hide the child's age created a challenging situation for the flight attendant, who ultimately decided to allow the family to remain on the flight but reported the incident to the CSA upon landing. The incident highlights the challenges faced by flight attendants in enforcing mask policies and the need for passengers to adhere to safety regulations.",between attendant and passengers

He came very close to me and my jumpseat; and I quickly asked if he wouldn't mind taking a step back; and thanks. I asked him also to please wear his face/nose covering. He replied that he did not have one. I began to feel very uncomfortable as he was having trouble keeping his distance while also not having a face covering on. I told him if you can go get your face covering at your seat; we'd all really appreciate it and I'll get your waters and snacks ready in the meantime. He said again he did not have one. I told him that we will provide one for you no problem. So I had Flight Attendant (FA) A go and grab one for him and he slowly and reluctantly put it on. He started saying that it doesn't make sense that he was allowed to board without one. I specifically recalled him wearing one before and during taxiing out.He stood in the back galley and was now complying with wearing the mask and I gave him some waters and snacks. He asked for my name and badge number to file a complaint. I told him that this isn't anything personal or something to argue about; it's just our company's policy to wear a face covering and it's something that not only makes me feel comfortable but all the people around you. I also gave him my first name and the flight number. He started to tell me in an argumentative way that it is how I said for him to put his face mask on that was rude especially with asking him to take a step back when he wasn't wearing one at all. I told him that I had nicely asked him and now you're wearing one that we provided; thanks. He explained further that he thinks that I'm 'one of those people on the left.' I simply explained to him that I don't want to argue about this as this is simply just a policy that everyone on board must comply with; that's it! He tried to keep arguing with me and I replied that I'm not here to argue about this; or what I was asking you to do; I'm just grateful that you're now wearing your mask; so thank you. He kept insisting that the crew today is terrible and that he wants to file a complaint. He also kept mentioning that he wasn't wearing one during boarding. Something felt a little off about him; I kept insisting that this is our policy and that we appreciate his compliance. No warning was necessary because the guest complied with wearing the mask from the point when I provided one.The guest claimed he was not wearing a face mask when boarding; even though I recall seeing him wear one.

The attendant requested the passenger to step back and wear a mask, citing company policy. The passenger responded by stating he didn't have a mask and expressed discomfort. The attendant had another crew member fetch a mask, which the passenger reluctantly put on. The passenger then argued that the request was rude and claimed he wasn't wearing a mask during boarding, despite the attendant's recollection of him doing so. The passenger requested the attendant's details to file a complaint, accusing her of being partisan.

It is also something that's included in our announcement before departure and our welcoming/safety announcement. When working AFT I actively check for mask; bag; and seat belt compliance prior to closure of the boarding door. I also ask the flight deck to make an announcement regarding face masks and to ensure coverage of both nose and mouth is included so that we are all unified. All gate agent pre-boarding announcements and Flight Attendant announcements should be updated to specify that passengers must cover their nose and mouths throughout the full duration of flight unless actively eating or drinking.Passenger X (X1) was the last passenger to board. The gate agent waited 10-15 minutes for this passenger. She mentioned that she reminded this passenger regarding mask compliance at the gate; however I was unaware until I saw her in passing between flights. I reminded this passenger to comply with his mask during boarding. Once the boarding door was closed the AFT FA asked the passenger to turn his phone on airplane mode and to disconnect his call. He complied until she walked passed and got directly back on the phone all through our safety demonstration. The non-revenue FA that sat in row X in front of the passenger rang the FA call button before I took my jumpseat to discreetly inform me that he was still on his cell phone. I glanced back and he was indeed holding a full conversation on his cell phone. I was unaware that the AFT FA had already asked him to end his call. He complied and I witnessed him turn his phone on airplane mode. I also asked this passenger to wear his mask properly and informed him that after I'd have to share our final warning. The non-revenue FA in row X rang me again to inform me that as soon as I took my jumpseat this passenger took another call and talked until his phone disconnected at 10;000 feet.

'We were told 2 is okay for no mask.'  'He won't wear a mask.'I decided to disengage and have the Customer Service Agent (CSA) contacted.

The ZZZ Station needs to retrain or re-examine the Mask Policy because it is very clear on all guest facing touch points that our policy is stated age 2 and up. Our ZZZ Station CSA's are advising guests incorrect age requirements for our mask policy. I advised both CSA's that due to the statements made by the parents that their child would not wear a mask that the FA crew wanted them removed from the flight.As the family deplaned they yelled and blamed me for getting them kicked off this flight. I apologized but I reiterated our mask policy as they were deplaning.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a family with child were removed from the flight because of non-compliance regarding face mask policy. The family was incorrectly told by station agents; a mask was not required for the 2 year old.,"A conflict arose during a flight when a family with a 2-year-old child boarded without the child wearing a face mask. The flight attendant (FA) identified the issue and approached the parents, who refused to comply with the face mask policy, citing incorrect prior information from station agents that a 2-year-old does not need a mask. The FA escalated the matter by contacting a Customer Service Agent (CSA), who confirmed the parents' claim. However, the FA emphasized that the airline's policy clearly states that children aged 2 and older must wear masks, with no exceptions. The FA requested the family be removed from the flight due to their non-compliance. The family was eventually asked to deplane, blaming the FA for their removal. The FA apologized and reiterated the mask policy. The incident highlighted a potential need for retraining or re-examining the mask policy communication at the ZZZ Station, as the CSA had incorrectly advised the parents about the age requirement.",between attendant and passengers

Passenger in doing so FA A noticed she was wearing a small boot on her left foot. FA A informed the pilots we had to re-seat passenger. Pilots pulled over; passenger was reseated and we went on our way.I do not know the exact time of day this happened; but was told we arrived 5 minutes late. But it says differently on our payroll sheet which says we arrived early. With that being said; we had a few mask situations during descent; one passenger complaining another wasn't wearing her mask; both passenger were through passenger. Announcements were made; 2 of the 4 FAs spoke to the unmasked passenger. During cleaning of aircraft a passenger informed me of the passenger not wearing her mask. I spoke to the unmasked passenger explaining why she had to wear a mask; but we ended up requesting either Operations or a Supervisor to speak to unmasked passenger because she told me the old lady needs to mind her own business.

During the flight, the FA noticed a passenger wearing a small boot on her left foot, which required the passenger to be reseated. This led to a slight delay, though there was a discrepancy in the reported arrival time. During descent, two passengers were observed not wearing their masks, and the FA made announcements to address the issue. Two FAs spoke to the unmasked passengers, and an operations agent resolved the situation by speaking to the unmasked passenger, who then complied and moved seats. Upon boarding, another passenger tried to sit in an Over Wing Window Exit (OWWE) using a seatbelt extension, and passengers were observed letting their masks slip below their noses. One passenger removed her mask while on a call, but the FA intervened, and the passenger complied. The FAs conducted heavy mask patrols throughout the flight to ensure compliance.

The flight attendant reported that passengers blatantly refused to comply with the mask-wearing requirement, which mandates masks to be worn at all times, even while sleeping, except when actively eating or drinking. Many passengers either did not wear masks at all, only covered their mouths, or removed their masks as soon as the flight attendant was out of sight. Despite the flight attendant's efforts to enforce the policy, the passengers displayed non-compliant behavior, including rolling their eyes and pretending to follow instructions. The flight attendant expressed concern over the lack of adherence, emphasizing the importance of mask-wearing for safety and the need for strict enforcement, as other airlines consistently enforce such policies.

Flight Attendant B asked her to put the mask on and the passenger said she can't talk on the phone through a mask. Flight Attendant B insisted and the woman begrudgingly put the mask on. As I passed by the passenger she was again not wearing the mask and speaking on her phone. I stood by the seat in front of her waiting for a good break in the conversation for a time to talk with her and she wrapped up the conversation and said sorry and put the phone away. I told her it wasn't an issue with the phone; but the health and safety of those around her. She put her mask on. Shortly thereafter as we were preparing the cabin for departure I noticed her mask was below her nose. She was wearing her headphones and did not hear me; but when she saw me she pulled the mask up over her nose. Based on the attitude she gave Flight Attendant B and the fact that the mask was off again when I came by; and then not properly worn a third time Flight Attendant B and I concurred that if we had to speak with her again it would merit a disciplinary action. We also told the flight deck this; so that they would be aware. Throughout the flight we did have close eyes on her; as one does when a passenger has already exhibited behavior that is against the rules; but I tried not to hound on her. During service I saw her and some others wearing their mask below their nose or off in the long times between sips and I made a PA asking everyone to be compliant (in no way singling her out).Once it came time for final compliance for landing I came back through and again her mask was fully below her nose. I stopped and kneeled down and told her that we had already spoken with her about the mask and that wearing it under the nose does not comply. During the conversation that followed she did not pull her mask over her nose until after I had walked away.She told me that she has a medical condition that makes her light headed and that she has been doing her best with the mask. I told her that while for several months we had mask exemptions for medical cases for the last month it has been mandatory regardless of individual. She asked me for my full name and asked if she could take a picture of my name tag. I told her I was not comfortable giving my last name but if she reached out to the company they would know who I was. She said that I was rude for hounding her and briefly said the word 'Nazi' in reference to my strict adherence to the mask policy and 'targeting' of her.The specifics of timing between what was said during this conversation and what was said in the conversation after I brought disciplinary action and later during final compliance all kind of meld; but these things were said.She said that it was wrong to single out people who have medical conditions and that they don't have to share what the condition is. I reminded her that at no point did I ask her what her condition is and that she only shared that she had a condition at the end of the flight after things came to a head. I also explained again that regardless of condition the mask policy is for anyone who wants to fly.Some guests in the nearby rows thanked me for sticking to the policy as they had had concerns with the passenger in question not wearing her mask throughout the flight. I did my best to thank them for their support; but also to not rile up the non-compliant passenger nor the woman across the aisle who seemed to have befriended and come to the passenger's side (however this woman never spoke up to me or in my earshot). I did not want to put passengers against each other or cause more disruption.Passenger also said that she was not planning on flying [Airline] ever again. We let the Captain know [of the situation] and he called ahead to have a Supervisor meet passenger. During deplaning several of the other passengers that were in surrounding seats and had spoken up again thanked me for the way I handled the situation and said they'd be writing in to the company.,,Passenger was sitting in seat XX1. When securing the cabin before door closure she was on phone and had mask looped on one ear and hanging down and I asked her to put it on she said 'but I can't talk on the phone with it' and I said 'I apologize but it has to be worn over your nose and mouth at all times it is our policy' then she just looked at me with an attitude and then I asked her again if she could please put it on to which she said 'sssuurrreeee' and put it on. Then I informed another FA and told him to keep an eye on her and then he immediately walked through the cabin and she had it off again; not even one minute later. So he also asked her to put it on. After safety demo passenger had mask on but not covering her nose FA A asked her to pull it up and make sure it is covering both her nose and mouth.Inflight there were times she took exaggerated time to eat and drink. As were others in the cabin so we made a PA; (overall I bet we made 20 mask policy PAs during the entire flight).Then during descent FA A observed her with it off again. I seen him having a conversation with her so I approached and he mentioned to her the policy and the reasons and the procedure and then told her he would be back.He said she said she knows the policy. And around that time she mentioned to him that she was trying her best but she has a medical condition. She continued to argue with him and ask for his name to file a complaint. Passengers in front of and behind her gave thanks to FA A for enforcing the policy and said he handled it well. I do believe she overheard them praising him.

The attendants, following company protocols, persisted in their requests, leading to a confrontational exchange where the passenger used derogatory language. The situation was reported to the captain, who arranged for a supervisor to meet the passenger upon landing.

I noticed him walk on with the gate agent who was asking him to put his mask back on. The gate agent then told me that they had been trying to get him on a flight for 3 days. I asked more about this; feeling a little concerned as to what could have caused them to deny him boarding these previous days and if it could be an issue during the flight. They told me the previous days he had not wanted to board the plane. He had explained to them that he hadn't gotten sleep and also hadn't eaten. I'm not sure what happened those past few days but it was communicated that he had gotten enough sleep and was able to finally board the plane.I made sure to ask clearly if they thought there might be any issue during the flight or if there was anything I should know that could cause an issue in-flight. The agent I talked to said she thought he was harmless.During boarding a woman nearby asked if he was going to wear his mask. I looked over and he had it down at his chin. I asked him to put it on and he did. This was an ongoing issue during the flight - he kept taking it off and we had to keep asking/reminding him to put it on.While taxiing to takeoff he got up out of his seat and moved a few rows back. I alerted the Captain but by this time he was already seated back down. We took off. I had him move back to sit in his original seat and he seemed fine the rest of the flight.   Right before takeoff while we were still taxiing; [he] got up out of his seat and moved back a few rows to the exit row. I called the Captain and let him know someone was out of his seat. By this time [he] was seated a few rows back. The pilot made an announcement that everyone needed to be in their seat and then we took off. We just continued with taking off when we were scheduled. The thing is; [he] was now seated in an exit row for takeoff and he had not been briefed to sit there. I also doubted his ability to perform the necessary exit row duties. Once we were up in the air I did go back and confirmed that [he] was now seated in an exit row. I had him move back to his original row where he stayed for the duration of the flight. The only other issues we had was that when I would walk by he wasn't always wearing his mask. I would remind him and he would put it on. He seemed not to be intentionally doing it but perhaps just not mentally 'all there.'More communication from CSA to CSA. When we arrived in ZZZ1 I alerted the gate agent that we had a meet and assist and the D FA pointed him out to the gate agent as he deplaned. I don't think the extent of the situation had been communicated. Then again it's not our job to babysit people. Maybe his family should have been contacted and asked to fly with him? He seemed unfit to fly on his own.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger kept switching seats and did not comply with face mask policy during flight.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and a passenger (Party2) on a flight.

The flight attendant noted his non-compliance with the face mask policy, requiring multiple reminders. Additionally, the passenger moved seats twice: first to the exit row during taxiing and again after takeoff, where he remained without proper briefing. The flight attendant had to intervene each time, successfully moving him back. The passenger also seemed mentally fatigued, often removing his mask unintentionally. Upon arrival, the flight attendant informed the gate agent but did not fully communicate the issues.

I told her I would check and see if there was another seat she could move to.  At this time I did not see any open row that has no other people in it. I was going to send a flight family message to alert the Gate Agent. I walked up a row or two and another lady questioned me about why her seat would not recline (she was in front of the exit row). I explained to her why her seat would not recline and told her I would check with the agent about reseating them.  I then walked to the aft jump seat to send the flight family request. The agent then came down and we had a short conversation about rebooking the one lady and the other passengers who wanted a seat that reclined. There were no other seats to move the recline passenger to and the other passenger was given the option to take a later flight with no guarantee that she would have a seat by herself.  I informed all passengers involved. We took off and it was not till about mid flight that I realized that I had not ok'ed my exit seats. I proceeded right away to the exit row and briefed both passengers and they both were ok to sit in an exit row. The lady passenger did say that she noticed I had not briefed them before the flight. [The cause was] work overload.,,,,Flight Attendant reported inadvertently not briefing exit row passengers due to other passengers making special seating requests.,"During a flight, a flight attendant encountered two passenger requests that led to a challenging situation. First, a passenger sought a different seat due to discomfort sitting next to someone unknown. The flight attendant attempted to find an alternative but found none available. Second, another passenger's seat would not recline, as it was located in front of an exit row. The flight attendant explained this and suggested a later flight option, as no other seats were available. While managing these requests, the flight attendant neglected to brief the exit row passengers, a crucial safety procedure. Mid-flight, she realized this oversight and promptly briefed the exit row passengers, who agreed to their seats. The cause of the incident was attributed to work overload from handling multiple requests simultaneously. The flight attendant resolved the issue by briefing the exit row passengers mid-flight, ensuring safety standards were met.

I informed him it was mandatory to wear the mask and if he was not able to comply with safety instructions that it would be addressed at that time not during the flight.  He cursed at me; at that time his female traveling companion told him to stop and to listen.  She said he would comply with crew member instructions.

At that point FA D called the Captain and told him everything that happen since this passenger came on board the flight.  FA D requested the Captain to remove this passenger from the fight.  However; the Captain came on the PA made an announcement to all the passengers that there was a passenger on board that was not complying with crew instructions and for the passenger to comply with airline instructions right away [or] that he would be going back to the gate.  Apparently the passenger immediately put his shoes and mask back on.  FA came back to this passenger and his duffle bag was placed in overhead compartment.  During takeoff he and his traveling companion pulled down their mask; this happened repeatedly throughout the flight.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger did not comply with the face mask policy; nor cell phone regulations.,"The incident occurred during a flight involving **FA B**, a flight attendant, and a male passenger seated in **XX1**. The passenger refused to comply with the mandatory face mask policy during the safety demonstration, citing claustrophobia. He was also using his cell phone, which was against regulations. When instructed to comply, the passenger cursed at FA B, prompting his traveling companion (a female passenger) to intervene and urge him to follow crew instructions. FA B had to pause the safety demonstration twice to address the passenger's non-compliance. Later, during takeoff, another flight attendant, **FA D**, noticed the passenger had removed his shoes, was not wearing a mask, and had placed his duffle bag near his feet. FA D felt threatened by the passenger's behavior and reported the situation to the captain. The captain addressed the issue over the public announcement system, requesting the passenger to comply with crew instructions immediately or face disembarkation. The passenger complied by putting on his shoes and mask and securing his bag in the overhead compartment. However, during takeoff and the subsequent flight, the passenger and his traveling companion repeatedly pulled down their masks, continuing to disregard the mask policy. The incident disrupted the flight and raised safety concerns for the crew.",between attendant and passengers

The A FA was in the midst of making a PA; so I went back to talk to him. I politely asked this guest if he had a mask; if not I could provide him with one. He responded; that he indeed had one. I let him know that he had to put it on. I stood to the side while this guest put away his carry-on bags and got into seat and buckled up. At this point; I informed him that he needed to put his mask on at this time; and I walked up front to inform the A about our interaction. I went back closed some bins and saw that he still had no mask on. This time the A FA went back to this guest carrying some extra masks and asked him if he needed one. He responded to her saying he had one. So she politely asked him to put it on. In a stern and harsh voice; he told her 'I heard you the first time.' The A FA came forward. The Customer Service Agent (CSA) was by the boarding door; and the A informed her on what was going on and the CSA automatically knew who we were talking about. She already had a discussion with this guest about wearing a mask on the plane. He put it on in front of her; but took it off before he got on the plane. We decided that a Supervisor needed to have a talk with him. The A FA informed the Captain on the situation and he went to the back of the cabin; and noticed that this guest was still not wearing a mask.A CSA Supervisor; came onto the plane and removed the guest who was non-compliant with the company's face mask policy.,,Passenger in XX4 boarded the aircraft last; with no mask. I was making a PA while the FA D had just started closing bins etc. I noticed he was not wearing a mask after he passed me. D FA asked him to put a mask on and if he needed one. He said he had one. She asked him to put it on and thanked him. He stowed his bag and she again asked kindly to please make sure your mask is on. He did not. The FA walked away. After waiting approximately 5 minutes and no compliance I; the A FA walked backed back to his seat bringing extra masks. I tried to hand him one. He said I have one. And I said; please put it on. He then said sternly and harshly; I heard you the first time.  I walked way. He did not put a mask on. Our Captain walked by to introduce himself to the FAs in the back; the passenger still did not comply.  I asked the agent about him. She said; yes I had to tell him to put it on in order to board.  He complied; so I let him board. He obviously took it off after passing her. He was asked 4 times to comply. I decided giving him a warning before we closed the door was only going to escalate the situation.  We decided to ask the agent to deplane him. As he deplaned with agent he still did not have a mask on nor was he trying to put one on. The crew did not feel comfortable with him going with us.,,Air Carrier flight attendants reported a passenger would not comply with face mask policy and was removed from the flight.,"The incident occurred during boarding when a flight attendant noticed a passenger without a face mask.

Passenger X started to go on about how a mask doesn't protect anyone; so at that point I said I would be back right back. Because he wanted to escalate the situation I went up to tell the A Flight Attendant; she came back and explained to Passenger X the company's policy.

I was in the front galley when he came forward because I had finished securing the cabin. The operations Agent and Supervisor left the aircraft; and the passenger was standing in the front galley. He was visibly frustrated on the event and started venting. This was in total public view of all other passengers on board. To help diffuse the situation; and spare the passenger from embarrassment; and to provide more of a private setting; I stepped off the aircraft with him; and stood at the bottom of the jetway with him while he vented to me. This was happening a few minutes before scheduled push time. I waited at the bottom of the jetway with the passenger for quite some time; expecting the operations Agent or Supervisor to come down; and I could direct him to them to answer questions he had. After several minutes; no one came to the plane; I made an executive decision to assist the passenger; told [Flight Attendant] A I was going to walk him to the top; and that I would be right back; since no agent was coming down. I walked him to the top of the jetway; where he was able to be properly assisted. I immediately walked back to the plane where a couple of minutes later we closed the door and pushed the flight as normal. Since the passenger was left at the plane; and there were no ground personnel to assist us (the Supervisor and operations Agent were there; then left); I made the executive decision to deplane. I believe I made the right decision in the moment given the situation. I do not know why the Supervisor didn't stay there with the passenger to assist him. I realize fully we all have a job to do; and cannot speak for why the Supervisor and operations agent left the passenger at the plane; and did not walk him up the jetway. I am not putting blame on anyone; I am simply writing an observation. Ultimately; it was me who made the decision to deplane.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that after boarding the aircraft they exited with a passenger who did not comply with face mask policy.,"The incident began when a passenger failed to comply with the face mask policy, prompting their removal from the aircraft. The Flight Attendant, having completed cabin checks, encountered the passenger in the front galley, who was visibly upset and confrontational, attracting attention from other passengers. To de-escalate, the Flight Attendant escorted the passenger off the plane, where they waited for ground personnel. However, when the Supervisor and operations agent did not return, the Flight Attendant, recognizing the need for timely action, decided to walk the passenger to the jetway's top to assist him further. This action allowed the flight to proceed normally, with the door closing and departure as scheduled. The Flight Attendant's decision to assist the passenger herself resolved the situation, highlighting her proactive approach in the absence of ground staff.",between attendant and passengers

To address the communication challenges, it was recommended that every flight be equipped with jet bridge phone numbers to facilitate timely communication with ground agents, thereby improving customer service and ensuring timely passenger deplaning.",between attendant and passengers

The passenger had a hoverboard in a box that was initially unnoticed during boarding but was observed during taxi-out. The FA reported this to the Captain, who permitted it if the lithium battery was under 50 grams, citing their manual. However, the FA referenced their manual, which prohibited PMDs (Personal Mobility Devices) as carry-on or checked baggage. The manual was found to have conflicting sections: one prohibiting PMDs and another allowing them with battery limitations, which were unclear regarding exact gram limits. The flight crew believed their manual permitted the hoverboard's battery. To resolve the issue, they proposed aligning FA and flight crew manuals to avoid confusion, adding boarding pass notifications for bulkhead passengers to brief at the gate, and enhancing the FA manual's specificity on PMD definitions under hazardous materials. The key cause was manual discrepancies, with proposed solutions to improve clarity and procedures.",between attendant and passengers

There was a lot going on in the exit row and I was preoccupied with confirming that two younger passengers met the age requirement and whether another passenger was willing to assist. One of the last passengers to board was holding a really small dog in front of her face and I was concerned with whether or not she was wearing a mask with a valve on it. After she sat in the exit row and I determined she had a mask with a valve and needed to get her a disposable mask; I failed to realize that her dog disqualified her from sitting there because I was distracted by her mask and addressing the other passengers' needs to meet exit seat criteria. I did confirm the other passengers' eligibility and briefed the exit row passengers; but during cruise; the B Flight Attendant notified me there was a passenger with a dog in the exit row. I was shocked to realize my mistake and immediately moved the passenger to an empty seat behind the exit row; so the passengers met the exit seat criteria for final descent.Focus my attention on scanning each passenger again for selection criteria prior to briefing and really check on their laps and under their seats for pets.

I told them once we're finished boarding we can see if there's empty seats or you can talk to the gate agent if not. One of them sits across in XX4 for time being. Customer Service Agent (CSA) comes on and says someone else is assigned that seat. He goes back to see who should be in that seat; comes back and finds him sitting in row XY next to someone; I guess they knew each other. So the other customer stays in XX4.The customer in Y2 was also seated next to a stranger; and asked about moving up to row 1. I said unfortunately because we have seating caps; first class is at its max up there. I said once CSA comes back you can talk to him. I go to get a trash bag to collect the purell wipes; and he's right behind me when I turn around. I was confused why he was there all of a sudden. He said he would go talk to the gate agent. I told him to make sure he has all his bags if he's stepping off; but didn't understand why he didn't just wait for GA to come back. Because he had to come back to sort out the customers in row XX. And he asked why he had to take his things; thinking that meant he'd miss the flight. I asked why not just wait in your seat until the gate agent comes back; and he calmed down and nodded; saying that's a better idea. I guess he didn't hear me when I initially told him to wait for CSA to come back. Then CSA comes on and finishes sorting [out] XX12. Then he talks to Y2 and says exactly what I told him about seat caps; maybe he told him something more I'm not sure. Y2 kept complaining about the whole row 1 being open; and why can't he sit there; as if nobody explained the covid seating caps to him (both me and CSA did).Then; I finish collecting wipes and notice XX2 has a lace mask. Like lacey dress or underwear material; super thin with holes in it. And I ask if she has a regular mask without holes; or we can give one to her. And she has a startled/insulted look on her face; and says how she needs the holes because 'I can only breathe out of my left nostril.' I told her if it's a medical concern; it's not showing up on our end; and we weren't informed of any passengers with medical exceptions. So we would need to talk to the CSA and get that on your booking; so you can get an exception. And then she says how she flew with that mask from ZZZ; and it was fine. I told her it was possible nobody noticed on those flights; and unfortunately it's not allowed. Even if nobody else noticed before; that doesn't mean I can ignore it when I notice.So I go back up and flag down the CSA as he's closing the jetbridge doors. And I ask him about any medical exceptions; and he said nobody was approved for that and that he didn't notice anyone with a lace mask. So he says he'll be back with a mask. We have masks onboard but it was better he did that because she was already giving me attitude about it. He comes back and asks who it was and I said XX2; one of the ones we were talking with earlier. He goes back and gives her the mask and comes back saying how she told him that she wore that mask from ZZZ and I that he told her that it doesn't matter what happened on previous flights. Basically the same stuff from when I spoke to her.She got past him during boarding; then the other FA up front; then me in back during the whole seat issue; and then the GA again when he helped with the seat issue. And it wasn't until near departure time that I even noticed. So I think there's a good chance that on her other flights; those CSAs and FAs didn't notice either.Also; it was obvious she didn't have a medical exemption because she told me she needs a hole-y mask since she can only breathe out of 1 nostril. What I did not tell her was that she was speaking to a FA who hasn't been able to breathe out of either nostril in years because of a medical issue; and I was wearing a regular mask just fine. Iwould feel blessed if I could breathe out of even just one nostril. Somehow she didn't think that breathing out of one's mouth alone is possible in a mask. And I know I'm not the only FA with a similar sinus issue; too; and we all wear regular masks.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that several passengers had seat location issues and another passenger was not wearing a proper face mask.,"The incident occurred during a flight, involving several passengers and the flight attendant (FA). The first issue arose when passengers in seats XX1 and XX2 requested to move due to discomfort sitting next to strangers. The FA explained that seat assignments would be sorted by the Customer Service Agent (CSA) upon boarding completion. One passenger moved to seat XX4, which was initially assigned to another passenger. The CSA eventually resolved the seating arrangement.
The second issue involved a passenger in seat Y2, who sought to move to row 1 but was informed that first class was at capacity. The passenger grew agitated and insisted on speaking to the gate agent. The FA advised the passenger to wait for the CSA, who later confirmed the seating restrictions. Despite efforts to explain, the passenger continued to complain about the seating policy. The final issue occurred when the FA noticed a passenger in seat XX2 wearing a lace mask with holes, which violated the airline's mask policy. The passenger explained that the mask was necessary due to a medical condition, but the FA noted that no medical exception had been filed. The FA referred the passenger to the CSA, who provided a proper mask. The passenger was initially resistant but ultimately complied.

Her responses to that was did I know that the politicians didn't believe in masks and I told her that this wasn't political; it was me doing my job to enforce our policy. She continued to give me attitude and talking about it was political. I went to the back and informed Flight Attendant (FA) C and D how my second encounter went and that she would be an issue the remainder of the flight and I strongly believe we should give her the Warning. They both offered to be the one to talk and give it to her. Flight Attendant C took care of that.While passing out the snack mix; I got to the row the husband was in. He asked for the wife's snack and his mask was down and FA D asked him to make sure his mask was up. XX4 had some kind of response that I missed but FA D told her not to have attitude towards us when we were just doing our job. Then she responded as a victim; saying she's been yelled at the whole flight and that she has been talking to us respectfully and not yelling at us. Which is not the truth because my encounters with her were very unpleasant; disrespectful and had the intent to belittle me and the policy.The remainder of the flight the entire family didn't comply with the mask policy. Their son rarely had the mask on when I passed; the daughters below their nose and the husband as well even though he would pull it up as we passed by. We all spoke to the family at one point and most of us multiple times. The mother was constantly having the mask below her nose or pulling the mask away from her face as she spoke to her kids and the woman across from her. I also was informed that another guest moved his seat because he was so uncomfortable sitting in front of them. I was told after everyone was off that they didn't have their mask on properly while deplaning either.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a family would not comply with face mask policy.,"The incident involved a flight attendant attempting to enforce the face mask policy with a family onboard. The family, particularly the mother, repeatedly failed to comply and displayed disrespectful behavior. The flight attendant addressed the family multiple times, escalating the situation. Another crew member eventually intervened, but the family continued to disregard the policy. Their non-compliance caused discomfort for other passengers, with one moving seats. Despite efforts, the policy wasn't followed, and the flight attendant reported the incident upon landing. The summary remains neutral, focusing on facts without judgment.",between attendant and passengers

I asked her to cover her nose and mouth with her mask. She does not comply. She asks 'does this plane have oxygen? I can't wear this mask.'  I ask her if she is telling me she has a condition that requires oxygen during the flight then she needs to bring an approved Oxygen Canister on the flight. Meanwhile the passenger in [seat] YY1 sits down; mask below nose; and will not comply with many requests from me to pull her mask to cover her nose. I call the Captain to have him contact a Supervisor to remove these passengers and to let him know the passenger who sat in ZZ1 was demanding that I administer oxygen. Now a young man is trying to sit in ZZ2. I ask if that is his assigned seat. He was assigned [seat] XX2 I ask him to sit in his assigned seat.  He complies. Then a passenger shows up in [seat] YY2. He gets inside my personal space and is belly to belly with me saying he doesn't like how I am talking to these passengers.  [Passenger in seat] ZZ1 is asking me what was I going to do. And I told them that I had called the Captain to get someone to take them off because everyone has to properly wear a mask. I was hemmed in by passenger [in seat] YY2.

The first passenger, seated in XX1, was observed with her mask below her nose and did not adhere to requests to properly cover her nose and mouth. She questioned the oxygen policy, prompting the flight attendant to inquire if she required an oxygen canister, which she did not provide. Another passenger in seat YY1 similarly failed to comply with mask requirements, despite repeated requests. The flight attendant contacted the captain, who in turn reached out to a supervisor to address the situation. A passenger attempting to sit in the incorrect seat (XX2) was redirected to his assigned seat, which he complied with. However, another passenger in seat YY2 became confrontational, invading the flight attendant's personal space and expressing dissatisfaction with her approach. The flight attendant informed the passengers that those not complying with mask policies would be removed, and she summoned the captain again. Paramedics arrived and removed the passenger in seat ZZ1 from the flight. The station manager later arrived and was informed that the passengers in seats YY1 and YY2 needed to be removed for mask non-compliance and interference with crew duties. As a result, all identified passengers were removed from the flight, allowing the journey to continue safely. The solution involved ensuring compliance with mask policies and addressing interference with crew duties through passenger removal.",between attendant and passengers

There was a [reward system passenger] sitting behind me in [seat] Y4 and his traveling partner in [seat] Y6. This was my first flight back after a COVID exposure from the plane. During boarding I asked Y6 to make sure her mask stayed over her nose. She said it kept falling down. I offered one of ours but she declined. During the safety demo I once again asked her to pull up her mask. As soon as we took off they both removed their masks. Multiple times I asked them to put their masks on. When we were cleaning up for landing the passenger in Y4 started shouting at me asking for my name. He said because he had a drink in front of him he didn't need to put on his mask. I once again explained our policy was that it was only supposed to be removed briefly. He said he had been on 7 different flights and nobody had asked him to put on his mask. I was the first one. I called the B Flight Attendant to join the conversation. She reiterated our policy. After talking to him for a while he said he was extremely frustrated with the inconsistency of mask policy enforcement. He calmed down when we all agreed there should be more consistency with enforcing or explaining our mask policy.Just wanted to write this up as a safety issue. He also said he would be writing in to Airline.  As a [person in the reward system] not sure if he knew better and just didn't want to wear the mask or if nobody on other flights has actually enforced our mask policy.

During boarding, the flight attendant asked the passenger in seat Y6 to ensure her mask was properly covering her nose, but she declined, stating the mask kept falling down. The flight attendant offered a replacement mask, which was also declined. During the safety demonstration, the flight attendant again reminded the passenger to adjust her mask. After takeoff, both passengers removed their masks despite the flight attendant's repeated requests to comply with the policy. The passenger in seat Y4 became confrontational, stating he did not need to wear a mask while drinking and claiming it was the first time he had been asked to do so on any of his seven previous flights. He expressed frustration over inconsistent enforcement of the mask policy. The flight attendant called another flight attendant (Party 2) to assist, who reiterated the policy. After discussing the issue, the passenger calmed down when the flight attendants acknowledged the need for more consistent enforcement or clearer communication of the policy.

Since this was the second time I used the last approach to try to get her to comply. I spoke with her about her mask she said she couldn't wear it because she was drinking coffee I said I understand but as the announcement states if she isn't actively drinking she has to replace her mask. She then pulled her mask up and said this is ridiculous. I walked back to my galley and informed my A FA that I had spoken with her again about her mask because she had removed it again.

Passenger boarded the plane without wearing a mask and took a seat in X1. The Fwd FA approached and reminded passenger about the required mask policy. Passenger reluctantly complied and as the FA turned to walk away; the passenger called her an '[expletive]'. After the FA informed us about this; I first asked the FA if passenger is being disruptive. The FA stated that passenger was not. I then asked if she would like me to go speak to the passenger. The FA stated that was not necessary. Finally; I asked if she would like me to request a customer service representative. The FA again said no; the situation is under control and she would let us know if the problem continues. I messaged my Dispatcher to keep them in the loop of what was said. We pushed; de-iced; and while taxing to our assigned runway; I asked the FO to call and make sure there were no further issues in the back. The FA stated that the passenger had fallen asleep; so we elected to continue. About mid-way through the flight; the Fwd FA called up and stated that the passenger had woken up and was starting to cause some disturbances. The FO was already the PF and I asked him to take radios as well. The passenger asked for a cup of water so passenger didn't have to wear the mask because she was 'drinking'. The FAs let this go on for about '30 minutes' (quoting them) and the passenger had not drank any of the water. Passenger again was non-compliant with the mask and both FAs asked passenger three times to wear the mask. At this point; I sent another message asking for a customer service representative to meet us at the gate in ZZZ1 and explained to the Dispatcher everything the FAs had told me. About 5 minutes after that; the Fwd FA called up again. Again; I told the FO his controls; his radios. The FA then explained that the passenger was now starting to 'scream' on the plane and yelled very loudly; '#@%^! I'm not from [foreign country]!' While doing this; proceeded to flip off both FAs. I again messaged our Dispatcher with this information and now requested Security along with the customer service representative. The FAs and I talked back forth regarding passenger danger level. The passenger was remaining in the seat and making no other threatening gestures; so we did not see the need to declare an Emergency. We continued the flight to ZZZ1 with no further incidences. After landing; I had the FO call Ops just to make sure a customer service representative and security were waiting for us at the gate. Upon arrival into the gate; a customer service representative and security officer where indeed right there. The customer service representative immediately came onto the plane and removed the passenger.The FAs did not make any indication and no one told me they suspected the passenger was drunk. Seems as if passenger was just a genuinely disturbed person.We probably should have gotten security or customer service involved at ZZZ because of the name calling. Because the passenger had put on the mask and was making no further threatening behavior; we decided to make a note of it and continue. We all agreed though; that if passenger made one more derogatory comment; we would most likely be removing passenger from the flight. We had no further problems until mid-flight.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger was not compliant with mask policy and being disruptive.

However, the passenger cursed the FA after she turned away. The FA informed the flight crew, and the captain was informed. The captain assessed the situation, determined it was under control, and communicated with dispatch to keep them informed. The flight proceeded, but the passenger became disruptive again mid-flight, refusing to wear the mask and claiming to be ""drinking"" to avoid it. The FAs allowed this for about 30 minutes, but the passenger did not drink. When the passenger continued to be non-compliant, the FAs repeatedly asked her to wear the mask, prompting the captain to request a customer service representative and security. The passenger eventually screamed and flipped off the FAs, leading the captain to message dispatch again and request security. Despite the passenger's disruptive behavior, no emergency was declared. The flight continued to its destination, and upon landing, security and a customer service representative were present. The passenger was removed from the aircraft by the customer service representative. The FAs did not suspect the passenger was intoxicated but believed she was disturbed. The crew agreed that earlier intervention, such as involving security or a customer service representative, could have been warranted due to the initial name-calling.",between attendant and passengers

FA B went to Gate Agent during cleaning to advice of this passenger's attitude and non-compliance so Gate Agent could make a note for future travel. This passenger felt he was not going to wear mask as required. FA B advised gate agent row and seat area and agent opened up the location and verified passenger's information.  Due to constant resistance FA felt safer not to confront passenger directly. During 3 points this party was given clear instructions on mask covering requirements and possible travel denial.

Passenger X kept her mask below her chin throughout boarding and when I passed by her I told her she needed to keep her mask on. She initially complied but for the rest of the flight she kept pulling her mask down and placing her fingers in her mouth and on her nose. During final compliance checks before landing her mask was down again and she was touching her nose. I told her to pull her mask up again. She refused and said she needed to blow her nose because of an ear issue. I told her she can pull her mask up over her nose and mouth and then pinch her nose over the mask and blow to relieve the pressure. She refused. I told her again that regardless her mask needs to cover her nose and mouth and continued my compliance checks. She ignored me and kept her mask down for landing. The couple did not take the mask policy seriously and ignored my warnings as if they were merely suggestions. They were blatantly non-compliant and they did not require their daughter to wear her mask at any time either.I believe that the couple should be placed on the mask noncompliance list because of their blatant non-compliant behavior and the way they ignored my instructions. There was not time during the flight to issue the warning or to call the pilots to arrange for [customer service] to meet the flight because we were in final descent during sterile cockpit.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a family was non-compliant with face mask policy throughout the flight.,"The incident arose due to Passengers X and Y, along with their daughter, refusing to comply with the face mask policy throughout the flight.

Every part of the flight (boarding; climb; cruise; etc.) seemed to be going fine and seemed standard. When the pilots told us to prepare the cabin for arrival; I decided to look over the PAX (Passenger) manifest before tossing it. I had used it during the flight but only looked at part of it. To be honest; I didn't read over it before we departed. When I read over it toward the end of the flight; I noticed that one PAX was listed as a Special Assistance Passenger. This PAX was listed as needing a wheelchair and as blind. At no point was I aware that we had a PAX with a visual impairment. The PAX was boarded first and the person who pushed his wheelchair stowed the PAX's luggage. When interacting with the PAX on boarding; I handed him a sanitizing wipe and he seemed to have no trouble getting the wipe from me or getting to his seat; although I didn't really watch him go to his seat. At no point did the gate agent inform us that we had a PAX with a visual impairment nor did the person who pushed the wheelchair. When the B Flight Attendant asked the gate agent if we had any specials (for the PAX count form) the gate agent said we had one wheelchair. There was no mention of a PAX with a visual impairment.We did the standard briefings (announcements and safety demo); but neither of us provided a one-on-one briefing with the PAX. We were unaware of his visual impairment. After I realized our mistake on descent; I wasn't sure what to do. I had a brief conversation with the PAX; and he seemed to look me in the eye for the conversation. After I played the final descent announcement; I showed the B Flight Attendant the manifest and how it showed a PAX listed as blind. She was surprised to see it. We discussed our situation in regard to the PAX and the possibility of writing a  report.After we landed; the PAX gathered his belongings and deplaned without help. He also told the person waiting with the wheelchair that he didn't need it. He was traveling alone and without the assistance of a service animal. He only used a simple walking cane; not a red and white cane frequently used by people with visual impairments. He gave me no reason to think that he was visually impaired; but I understand that some disabilities are not apparent. When all the PAX had deplaned; I informed the Captain of what had happened and asked for advice. He said to fill out an report because we didn't do a required briefing. The B Flight Attendant and I knew that one-on-one briefings are required; we didn't know the PAX was visually impaired.I am concerned and upset that we potentially caused a safety incident with a PAX with a visual impairment. This is unacceptable. I hope to use this as a learning experience and pay closer attention to the PAX manifest before shutting the boarding door and proactively asking all gate agents about special assist PAX that we may have onboard. I say this with caution; though. We don't always receive the correct manifest; we sometimes receive incomplete manifests with no PAX information; and sometimes we don't even receive a manifest at all. While in the end; it was my responsibility to confirm with the gate agent about special assist PAX; I feel like there was a breakdown of communication between the gate agent and me. I wonder if the gate agent knew there was a visually impaired PAX on the flight. Perhaps there could be strengthened training for gate agents and flight attendants for recognizing special assist PAX. For flight attendants; also what to do if a special assist PAX is discovered during flight and certain briefings did not occur; as in our case. As stated before; I didn't know what to do in regard to the PAX.I understand the severe safety hazards not providing a one-on-one briefing could have caused if something went wrong during flight. I hope to use this as a lesson learned and not solely rely on being informed of all special assist PAX by a gate agent. In other words; I need to be more proactive; and I need to use my resources more wisely. My hope is that this can be used as a lesson for all flight attendants so that incidents like this don't happen again. We are first and foremost a safety industry; and we failed to keep to our safety standards.,,,,Flight Attendant reported not performing safety briefing for blind passenger.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant (Party 1) who failed to provide a required one-on-one safety briefing to a visually impaired passenger (PAX) onboard the flight. The PAX was listed in the passenger manifest as needing a wheelchair and being blind, but the Flight Attendant was unaware of this until reviewing the manifest toward the end of the flight. This oversight occurred despite the manifest indicating the PAX's visual impairment. The Flight Attendant did not receive any communication from the gate agent or ground personnel about the PAX's condition. During the flight, standard safety briefings were conducted, but no special briefing was provided to the visually impaired passenger. Upon realizing the mistake during descent, the Flight Attendant briefly spoke with the PAX, who appeared to manage without assistance. After landing, the PAX deplaned independently, using only a simple walking cane, and declined the wheelchair assistance offered. The Flight Attendant reported the incident to the Captain, who advised filing a report due to the missed safety briefing, which is a regulatory requirement. The Flight Attendant expressed concern about the potential safety risks and acknowledged the need for improved communication and proactive verification of special assistance passengers. They proposed strengthening training for both flight attendants and ground personnel to better identify and address the needs of visually impaired passengers. Additionally, the Flight Attendant emphasized the importance of reviewing the passenger manifest before boarding and proactively confirming special assistance requirements with ground staff.",between attendant and passengers

During the flight FA B approached the galley and states to me that she was going to give Passenger X a face mask warning; because he was having a hard time complying to keeping the mask over his nose and she asked on numerous occasions before pushback; taxing out to the runway; and during the flight to keep his mask over his nose. I called flight deck to inform the Captain what was about to happen. So FA B gave the written policy to Passenger X and he stated he didn't want to see it. FA B informs me what happened and I call the flight deck. I tell the Captain she gave the warning and Passenger X refuses to hear it. The Captain states we'll just call for supervisors to meet us at the gate. FA B and I both say 'okay.' I decide to do a walk through in the cabin and notice Passenger X has his mask on covering his nose and mouth. I inform FA B and the Captain. Captain states that's great; but so there's no further issues with Passenger X we'll still have the Supervisor meet us. I say 'fine.' I guess noticing that FA B and myself are talking to the Captain inflight; Passenger X states to FA B he now wants to read the policy. Once seeing the policy and reading it Passenger X states to FA B that he's sorry. FA B then calls the Captain to let him know Passenger X has a change of heart. Captain still states he'll have the Supervisor meet the aircraft at the gate. We say 'okay.' Once at the gate; I open the main door and the supervisors are there. They wait for Passenger X to deplane to talk to him.

Despite multiple requests, Passenger X refused to keep his mask properly positioned. FA B then provided a written policy warning, which Passenger X initially rejected. The flight attendant notified the captain, who decided to involve supervisors at the gate. During the flight, Passenger X reconsidered, read the policy, and apologized to FA B. However, the captain instructed the supervisors to meet the aircraft upon arrival. The supervisors were present when the plane landed and addressed Passenger X as he deplaned, subsequently informing his connecting flight about the situation.

Passenger X was sleeping and I roused him on the arm and gave him his mask to put on; as he had placed the mask on his armrest. He put on his mask.  But sometime shortly before arrival (maybe 30 minutes before); I found him again without a mask and tried to rouse him. But this time he was wearing huge noise cancellation headphones and would not respond to any tapping or rousing; and no response to my calling his name.  He had drank some liquor during the flight; but not enough that he could not be roused.  I believe he was ignoring me on purpose and pretending to sleep; and had put the headsets on as an excuse to not hear me. Then the Captain called me that we had to prep the cabin early due to expected turbulence before landing.We then proceeded to do prep for landing. I again attempted to rouse Passenger X as his seat was reclined.  And again; no response. I had to physically push his chair upright; as he would not respond to do it himself.  Then I tried to rouse him again; tapping him; calling his name; and telling him to put on his mask. He finally slowly came awake. I put his mask in his hand (he again had put it on his armrest) and told him repeatedly to put on his mask.  He finally complied. And as he was leaving the airplane; I saw him again take off his mask at the jetbridge.I believe Passenger X was doing everything on purpose; and that he was awake and just pretending to sleep.  He would have had to have taken copious amounts of liquor to not have been aware of me rousing him; tapping him; or calling his name.  He also had this huge headphones on.

I called out to him and he opened his eyes and I told him for the third time about his mask. Once we got to the final descent his mask was down and I reminded him once again for the fourth time. Once I told him this time he just looked at me and shook his head. This passenger (XX1) and his wife seated in XX2 were both sick. They were both coughing without covering their cough.The couple kept coughing during takeoff; throughout the flight and landing. The coughing drew the attention of other passengers to look. People are very scared and when they hear coughing and other passengers [are] not wearing mask properly they worry. Many verbal warnings were given.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that a passenger had to be reminded four times to wear a face mask. Flight Attendant stated that the passenger and his wife were coughing without covering their cough.,"The incident occurred on flight ABCD from ZZZ to ZZZ1. A passenger seated in XX1 repeatedly failed to wear his face mask correctly, despite four verbal reminders from the flight attendant. His wife, in seat XX2, also coughed continuously without covering her mouth. Their improper mask usage and coughing drew concern from other passengers, who expressed worry during the flight. The flight attendant's repeated attempts to address the issue did not lead to a proposed solution, and the incident concluded with the couple's behavior causing passenger concern.",between attendant and passengers

I pointed it out to the gate agent and he stated it's approved; because it covers her nose and mouth. But I stated; no; because it's see through and mesh. Masks have to be made of solid material.So thinking the gate agent would say something to her about the mask Passenger X boards the plane and takes her seat wearing her mesh mask. FWD Flight Attendant (FA) sees this and questions it and then calls me for a reference. I stated to her; I don't think it's an approved mask for flying; let me find it in the manual before going to Passenger X. While I'm trying to find it; FWD FA sends a message to the gate agent about Passenger X wearing this mesh mask.  FWD FA also informs the Captain as well. After searching under COVID section; I find it and inform FWD FA and the Captain that it's not approved and that I'll inform her that her mask is not compliant. I approach Passenger X about her mesh mask and also show her in manual that it's not compliant. Passenger X makes a statement that she's been allowed to wear it on her flights. I then read the mask compliance portion in the manual verbatim. She makes a little fuss about it and then states 'Fine; hand me a mask.' I tell her 'Thank you.' I head back up to the FWD part of the cabin; galley area to inform FWD FA and Captain we're good. Passenger X switched out her mask for one of our mask. Also show them both in the manual where it's located if there's ever any other issues that arise in the future. They can both reference. Also state to the gate agent that Passenger X mask is not approved.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger was required to remove a mesh face mask; while the Gate Agent did not agree; and use a company supplied mask before departure.,"The incident involved a disagreement between a flight attendant and a gate agent regarding the approval of a passenger's mesh face mask. The flight attendant believed the mask was not compliant with airline policies due to its see-through material, while the gate agent initially allowed the passenger to wear it as it covered the nose and mouth. During the flight, the flight attendant questioned the mask's approval, consulted the manual, and informed the captain. The flight attendant then approached the passenger, showed the manual's mask compliance section, and explained the mask was not approved. The passenger initially protested but eventually agreed to exchange the mesh mask for a company-provided one. The flight attendant informed the gate agent and captain that the issue was resolved, providing future reference in the manual if similar situations arise.",between attendant and passengers

I agreed to tag team and verify she had ended her call. I walked by and she hid her phone down by her side; so I couldn't tell one way or another. I told the other FA I would check during final compliance. After our safety demo; I walked by and she was very clearly texting. I asked her to put her phone into airplane mode. I didn't want to appear that I was singling her out and hovering; so I walked away and checked on my way back up front. Again; she was very engrossed in her texting. She was sending and receiving messages and there was no airplane mode icon on her phone. It showed she had service. Again; I told her that her phone needed to be in airplane mode. I told her that we needed her to comply and put her phone in airplane mode now. She looked up at me; visibly annoyed; turned her phone away and said 'Yeah.' When I was standing there; she made no attempt to turn her phone into airplane mode. I didn't have a visual of the phone anymore but to my knowledge; she never did. Enroute; we caught a couple glances of her cell phone; every time it was not in airplane mode. It wasn't as if she was unaware; she actively chose not to comply.This passenger was a [premium frequent flyer]. Normally; passengers that are that non-compliant are asked to comply or to be removed from flight; however; neither one of us FAs felt the company would support removing a [premium member] over a compliance issue. We also feared we would have gotten in trouble if we had tried. I struggled with it because this passenger was purposely not complying and in an emergency; I don't know that I could count on her to follow crew member instructions.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being unwilling to report passenger misconduct due to the possibility of company retribution.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and a premium frequent flyer passenger. The flight attendant requested the passenger to end her phone call and switch to airplane mode as the cabin door was closing. Despite repeated requests, the passenger ignored the instructions and continued using her phone, which remained connected to service. The flight attendant hesitated to enforce compliance due to concerns about company retribution and potential trouble for removing a premium member. As a result, the passenger's non-compliance persisted throughout the flight, leaving the flight attendant uncertain about the passenger's reliability in an emergency.",between attendant and passengers

As soon as she saw I passed she flipped her phone face down on her tray table. I made an announcement to please make sure electronic devices are in game/airplane mode.This passenger is a [premium frequent flyer.] I feel if we would of returned back to the gate or had authorities meet the plane the company would not have had our back and would have reprimanded myself and my other flight attendant.

The attendant made several requests for the passenger to switch her device to airplane mode, but the passenger appeared non-compliant and displayed a smug attitude.

Flight Attendant A was in boarding position during boarding; but may have been temporarily distracted by a request from the flight deck when the [passenger of small stature] boarded. Flight Attendant C had not asked for assistance or confirmation regarding the suitability of the [passenger of small stature] for overwing exit row seating. When Flight Attendant A returned to the forward jumpseat; she asked Flight Attendant C about the passenger and whether she thought the passenger met the requirements. Flight Attendant A had noticed that the [passenger's] feet were sticking out just beyond the seat. Flight Attendant C assured Flight Attendant A that she had asked this passenger if she could perform the duties and had been answered in the affirmative.The passenger was seated and the plane was moving when Flight Attendant A first saw her. Flight Attendant A could not estimate the passenger's height or mobility at this time.Since evacuations are such a rare event; flight attendants frequently do not want to risk a passenger confrontation or worse; a claim of discrimination by someone in a protected group. However; a person claiming to have a disability may not be likely to meet the requirements; and be disqualified from overwing exit row seating.The Safety Information Card states that a person who sits in the exit row must have sufficient strength and dexterity to toss objects the size of the exit row window (approximately 50 lbs.) over seats. Of course; in the past; we actually had to remove the window. While it is no longer necessary to pull the window out and toss it over seats; it is likely that in an emergency an ABA [Able Bodied Assistant] at the overwing exit might have to wrestle luggage away from exiting passengers and toss it over seats. An ABA would also be expected to be able to assist other passengers.When the [passenger] exited the aircraft; Flight Attendant A noticed that she was approximately as tall as the G7 counter; about 42 inches. She was not especially stout; and probably weighed 80-90 lbs. Considering that she was only 3.5 feet tall; it is unlikely that she had the strength or stature to toss heavy objects over seats; or even lift something that weighed more than half her weight; or manipulate something the size of an overwing exit window. The proportionally shorter arms and legs of [small stature passengers] impact mobility.Flight Attendants are deathly afraid to be charged with discriminating or have a scene that could result in negative media. Additionally; the Flight Attendant runs the risk of not being backed up by the Customer Service Representative if they call for assistance.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger of small stature sat in the exit row and caused doubt as to whether she would be capable of assisting in an emergency.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant (Party1) who noticed a passenger of small stature seated in the overwing exit row. During boarding, the Flight Attendant was distracted and did not immediately assess the passenger's ability to assist in an emergency. Another Flight Attendant confirmed the passenger's capability without further evaluation. Post-departure, the Flight Attendant questioned the passenger's height and mobility, noting she was approximately 42 inches tall and weighed 80-90 lbs., making it unlikely she could perform necessary tasks. The concern arose due to the risk of discrimination claims and negative media, which deters Flight Attendants from challenging such situations. The result highlighted the need for a proposed solution: evaluating passengers' abilities before assigning exit row seating.",between attendant and passengers

It became apparent that while we thought he was sleeping with the blanket covering his head he had indeed been puffing his cigarette. (A-FA) then realized when she thought she had smelled a faint cigarette odor in FC (First Class) but found no smoke or anything in the lav she chalked it up to being on someone's clothes. These types of cigarettes are a newer items that are smokeless and quite odorless as well. He was standing outside baggage claim as we were walking to our crew van so (C-FA) and myself politely went up to him and mentioned that we had found his smokeless cigarettes around his seat. Our intention was to politely tell him that it was a fine-able offense and so for future flying he'd have been warned. However before we finished speaking he started berating us and our airline; using explicit language and saying we are the worst airline he's ever experienced and that the cigarettes had fallen out of his pocket. He said that he had already tweeted a negative review and was awaiting [TV New Channel] response and to get the '[Expletive deleted]' which (C-FA) and I remained calm and polite and walked away knowing anything else we might say would fall on deaf ears. During our agricultural form pass-out of the flight we had limited quantities so I allowed a few traveling families to include their elderly grandparents on their forms so that we had enough. (Literally we were short only 2 forms on walk through). [Passenger] said he heard that and was notifying [State] Agriculture that we allowed them to lie on their forms. However we had a few families take extra forms and then delivered those to previously stated families to fill out for the grandparents so his allegations were obviously not true. He was a very rude passenger and escalated any event on this flight to create a very hostile work environment. Earlier submitted report:We had a very disgruntled first time [Airline] flyer occupying seat XX.His first grievance was that we could not serve him a double bourbon upon boarding and then became pissed when he realized we served our pre-departure beverages in plastic glasses and refused his sparkling white wine when it was handed to him. His companion then requested a pillow which I told them we did not have and his response was 'Do you guys have [expletive deleted] anything'; I apologized and walked away. During the flight while I was guarding for a Pilot break he tried to stand and come forward; I politely explained I needed everyone to remain seated as the pilots were utilizing the lav. He began to complain once seated again that this was '[expletive deleted] unnecessary and he's never seen it before'...he then got impatient and got up to attempt going to the aft and rudely made his way past our C doing a water service cussing under his breath. While there was no personal damage done; his choice of foul language and bad attitude is worth mentioning seeing as our normally favored [Airline] service was not enjoyed by him and he may write one healthy complaint.[Passenger] should not be allowed to fly our airline and should be fined for his obvious rule breaking behavior. He was defiant and apparently has trouble understanding our responsibilities as a crew.,,Mid flight I noticed I smelled cigarettes around row X; and after looking could not locate the origin of the smell; and saw no smoke. At this point I figured someone had smoked before we left and had shifted positions and the smell was suddenly released from their clothing. After landing D FA (Flight Attendant) and I assisted with cleaning up FC (First Class) and found 3 cigarette butts all around his seat. After a little research we realized they were smokeless cigarettes. When letting our crew know; (Flight Attendant B) found one more. Passenger was 'sleeping' with his head covered under a blanket the entire flight. (Flight Attendant D) and (Flight Attendant B) informed him as they passed on the way to the shuttle that that kind of behavior is a fine able offense.Crew to be made aware of the situation on his original flight. Agents should inform him before he boards that this kind of behavior is illegal and flight attendants can and will in force FAA rules.,,Flight attendants reported finding smokeless cigarette butts and confronting passenger in baggage area.,"The incident involved a passenger (Party2) and a flight attendant (Party1) aboard a flight. The flight attendant discovered three smokeless cigarette butts in the first-class cabin near the passenger's seat. Despite the passenger appearing to sleep with a blanket over his head, the flight attendant noticed the butts and an odor she initially dismissed as clothing scent. Upon deplaning, the flight attendant and a colleague confronted the passenger about the butts, explaining it was a fineable offense. The passenger responded with explicit language, blaming the butts on his pocket and claiming he had already filed a negative review. During the flight, the passenger was confrontational, complaining about alcohol service and using offensive language. He disregarded crew instructions to remain seated and made inappropriate comments. His behavior disrupted the cabin environment and created a hostile atmosphere for the crew.The flight attendants also managed a situation where they allowed extra forms for families with elderly grandparents, despite a shortage. The passenger falsely accused them of misconduct, which was later proven baseless. The result was a disruptive and hostile environment for the crew, prompting concerns about the passenger's potential legal action or future banning from the airline. The flight attendant documented the passenger's behavior, highlighting his defiance and disregard for crew responsibilities.",between attendant and passengers

The passenger was informed to take a seat at mid to aft cabin due to distribution on the 800 aircraft; stating there is plenty of overhead bin space at the back for his carry on that seemed a bit large for the more narrow/less deep bins up front. The passenger snapped at the D Flight Attendant indicating that he was going to do what he wanted to do.Flight Attendant D recognized that the tall male passenger sat in the OWWE (Overwing Window Exit) Row. As the D made her way back she stopped to see how the passenger was doing. He was glossy eyed and loud. Flight Attendant D inquired if he had been smoking and under the influence of a substance. The passenger replied 'Yes; all day long.'  Flight Attendant D clarified if he were referring to Marijuana? The passenger replied 'Yes; I voted for it and I have been smoking all day long. We just signed a deal...' Then showing his logo/ clothing brand.The D Flight Attendant congratulated him on his business dealt then proceeded to inform the B Flight Attendant of the concern having a person under the influence of a substance in the OWWE. The B Flight Attendant concurred stating that 'Under the influence of a drug/marijuana is the same as alcohol.'The D Flight Attendant informed the A Flight Attendant of the concern then went up to the forward galley to discuss with the A [Flight Attendant]. The C Flight Attendant conducted the OWWE brief.The A [Flight Attendant] proceeded to talk to the passenger. The D Flight Attendant informed the flight deck both Captain and First Officer. No verbal response was given to the D Flight Attendant from the flight deck.The A Flight Attendant informed me; the D Flight Attendant that the man was okay.The D; said 'No he's not - he is admittedly in front of many passengers; I can smell the marijuana; under a controlled substance; approved use in Captain is only for use in the home and at a minimum he should not be in the OWWE; if even on this plane however even people who smell as if they've been drinking are not to be allowed to board.' The A Flight Attendant responded by saying; 'I spoke to him and leaned in and could not smell it.'Later the B Flight Attendant stated that he appears under the influence of marijuana/a substance and is eating a lot of pretzels; referring to the munchies.Later the C Flight Attendant stated that he (C) 'Heard how the passenger was talking to the D Flight Attendant and told him to settle down.' As the D Flight Attendant - the C heard that the passenger said he had been smoking marijuana all day long why was he allowed to remain in the overwing window exit?I think the FAM (Flight Attendant Manual) needs to clarify the term 'Intoxicated' to define if it only refers to alcohol or any substance to include marijuana; meth; speed; cocaine. Particular clarification is suggested with respect to marijuana as it is now legal in many states. However I don't think those laws supersede federal law or Federal Aviation Regulations. I think that the flight deck/ops made an error in allowing the passenger to remain in the OWWE; even if they wanted to approve a stoned/person under marijuana passenger to be able to remain on the plane. I think the fatal error was made in saying 'The A said the passenger was okay. 'If the A Flight Attendant has the final say then please clarify for crew.  The C and B Flight Attendants are still on probation and the A has not been flying too long. Being able to answer a question 'Yes; I will help' is not very reassuring when someone is under the influence of a primarily illegal substance even if it is legal in some states. It is a known fact that reaction time and mental processing of information is delayed under the influence of marijuana and other drugs; legal or illegal.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that a person under the influence of marijuana was allowed to remain seated in the emergency aisle after admitting being under the influence.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who encountered a passenger emitting the odor of marijuana. The passenger admitted to smoking marijuana throughout the day and refused to comply with instructions to move to the mid to aft cabin. Flight attendants noticed the passenger's behavior, including his glossy eyes and loud demeanor, and expressed concerns about his condition. They debated whether he should be removed from the overwing window exit seat due to safety concerns. The flight deck was informed but did not provide a verbal response. The A Flight Attendant deemed the passenger acceptable, while others, including the B and C Flight Attendants, disagreed, noting the passenger's behavior and the potential risks of marijuana use. The situation highlighted the need for clarification in the Flight Attendant Manual regarding the definition of ""intoxicated"" to include substances like marijuana, despite its legal status in some states. The crew's handling of the situation and the adequacy of their judgment were questioned.",between attendant and passengers

He immediately responded that he was a frequent flyer and didn't have to. I asked him politely stating that it was FAR procedure that bags that size be checked (it was over 21 inches in height and rather wide). He got belligerent and said he would be talking to the airline about the poor treatment. I apologized; stating that I was following procedure. He checked his bag and immediately came back saying he was being abused and that I had been yelling at him. At this point; I asked my Captain to see if there was anything he could do to alleviate his mood. My Captain politely talked to him; and the passenger sat down.Once everyone was on board and I got my final; I immediately did my announcements; count; and shut the door. When I did service; I asked him what he wanted and had him repeat it so I was certain I got it right. I then offered him his complimentary drink or snack because he was entitled to it. He got the [snack] box. I finished service; did a trash run; and as I am eating; he ripped back my galley curtain and demanded that I talk to the guy behind him who was rudely kicking his seat to not; because he should be allowed to keep his seat back. I nodded; and asked the guy behind him in [4C] to refrain from kicking him. It was painfully obvious that he wasn't doing it on purpose. The passenger in question was 6'5 and well over 350 pounds. He was just too big for the seat and was pressing against it; because his legs had nowhere else to go. I offered the passenger in 4C a different seat away from him and the passenger declined calling Passenger X an entitled baby and that he wasn't interested in moving for him. I did not respond in any way to the name calling; as I did not want to further gain Passenger X's ire; but I was very polite to both of them. About 25 minutes to landing; Passenger X asked for coffee. I told him we ran out; but offered to make him some. He declined.Other passengers remarked about his rude behavior and apologized to me. I didn't respond because it is unprofessional to do so. One woman told me I had the patience of a saint. Upon departing; he told the Gate Agent that I was drunk and rude. The Gate Agent talked to me and I explained that he was upset with me. She remarked that I definitely didn't seem drunk; just very happy go lucky.I boarded for the next [flight]. After shutting the doors; I started to do my safety announcements. I get a call from my Captain and notice the police are waiting. He had called the police and told them I was intoxicated. I don't drink. I haven't had alcohol in over 20 years. I explain this to the police and give them a statement and all my identification and information. I tell them I will fully cooperate with them and I am willing to give blood; pee in a cup; and take a drug or breathalyzer test. The police tell me I definitely do not appear to be drunk or on anything; but they must do a breathalyzer on me to document it. I absolutely complied immediately. I am given a breathalyzer and it comes out 00. The police apologized and I immediately go back to work.I will say that I am absolutely distraught that I was put in this situation. I am a very energetic and enthusiastic individual when it comes to doing my announcements. I am disheartened that my manners were misconstrued in anyway as I try to be as completely professional and polite to everyone I meet. I usually have a great time with my passengers and they always come out of my plane with a big smile on their face.

Zero forward visibility. Using weather radar. Seatbelt sign on. Occasional light turbulence. In the cabin; FA B (Flight Attendant) and FA C are standing in the rear galley. A paramedic and a nurse are assisting an ill passenger in seat 19b. Paramedics are waiting at destination. No ATC [notification was made].We see a small; individual cell ahead on radar: about 4 miles wide with light green rain indication and small amber center. We receive deviation clearance to the left from Control. We change course and continue descent. Visibility zero. When abeam of the cell on our right side; we flew through some imbedded cumulus and a short burst of rain. We received a quick; sudden jolt of moderate turbulence.I called back to the cabin via intercom to check with the cabin crew. I apologized about the event with no warning from us. I was assured that everything was okay although FA C sounded a bit unhappy about the event.We landed and arrived at the gate at [destination] with paramedics waiting to examine the ill passenger. A lot of confusion at the gate after the passengers deplaned with an army of cleaners coming aboard to 'turn' the aircraft. I saw FA A was moving aft to speak to FAs C and B while the cleaners and ground supervisors were on the airplane between us. The paramedics had left the jetway with the ill passenger. It was going to be difficult to wade through the cleaners to speak to my crew who were scheduled to fly the aircraft back to [origin]. Not having heard from them while at the gate; [First Officer] and I assumed our cabin crew were okay. We exited the aircraft to start our overnight.24 hours later; [First Officer] and I arrived at the aircraft for the northbound flight to [origin]. FA C and FA B were present and met us. It was then when we heard that they had sustained injury during the previous day while standing in the rear galley from the moderate turbulence jolt event. Both crew members complained of back and shoulder strain. In addition; FA C had sustained a small cut on her hand while grabbing a hand hold to steady herself.The event occurred because I failed to warn the cabin crew of possible moderate turbulence during descent. So; the crew was completing normal duties when the unexpected turbulence occurred. As is well known; turbulence effects are magnified when in the aft section of aircraft and also there was no warning of small bumps before the big jolt took place.I need to communicate better with my cabin crew during flight to warn them about turbulence ahead and also at the gate after such an event (by intercom; if necessary); to make sure that they are okay. I am not happy about my lack of knowledge about my cabin crew condition as I left the aircraft. One of my roles is to make sure they are okay and to assist them if they are not okay.,,,,A319 Captain reported learning the next day that Flight Attendants had been injured during an inbound turbulence encounter.,"An incident occurred during the descent of a flight, 100 miles north of the destination, where the flight crew encountered embedded thunderstorms with zero visibility. The flight crew deviated around a small thunderstorm cell, resulting in a sudden jolt of moderate turbulence. The cabin crew, including flight attendants B and C, were in the rear galley and were injured during the turbulence, sustaining back and shoulder strains, with FA C also receiving a minor hand injury. The incident was primarily due to the captain's failure to warn the cabin crew about the impending moderate turbulence, particularly considering the increased turbulence effects in the aft section of the aircraft. The flight crew descended through solid cirrus clouds, encountering light turbulence and using weather radar. Encountered a thunderstorm cell, leading to deviation and moderate turbulence. Cabin crew, assisting an ill passenger, were injured during the turbulence. Post-incident confusion at the gate hindered immediate communication with the cabin crew. The cabin crew sustained injuries, and the captain realized the need for improved communication regarding turbulence warnings and post-incident checks. Enhance communication with the cabin crew about upcoming turbulence and use the intercom to ensure their well-being after such events. The incident highlights the importance of timely warnings and effective communication to ensure the safety and well-being of the cabin crew during turbulent conditions.",between attendant and passengers

He had trouble getting bags in bin and slammed bins. He approached fwd galley asking C Flight Attendant for Band-aid with finger bleeding. The OPS agent came to finish up and I asked him what was going on with this passenger. I was told he was okay; they couldn't smell alcohol on him. He was probably tired from being out with business friends during the night. I voiced my concern of his wobbling; and his very slow movements and drifting off. I was told he was fine. The door was closed. During takeoff; he was loud trying to engage passenger in 1-A who feigned sleep. During service; he continually got up for the forward galley restroom but could not find the door; even trying the cockpit door. I stayed in the galley unless he was sleeping during most of the entire flight for security reasons. The B and C flight attendants were made aware of the situation. He continued his lavatory routine many times. At one point; he was returning to his seat and I heard a thud. He had fallen into the bulkhead row and was picking himself getting back to his seat. I asked if he was ok and he at first didn't respond. I asked again and he mumbled yes. I went back to fwd galley and I turned; he was right there backing me up saying he went to the doctor and had taken codeine and I had no right to ask him anything. I explained that I wanted to be sure he had not injured himself with the fall. He returned to his seat. He then shouted that he wanted my name. I stepped to the aisle and stated [my name]. He wanted my last name which I said we do not give out [last names] but [Company] has that info and knows who is working. He was upset. I turned to my galley and he jumped up and came at me with his phone and snapped my picture. I immediately asked him to delete it. He returned to his seat saying NO. I calmly told him that he cannot take a crew members picture without permission and he needed to delete it or have ground personnel meet the plane when we land. He refused. So I clearly stated; you are making the choice to have someone meet the aircraft because you are refusing to delete the picture. He just sat mumbling. The C Flight Attendant had come forward at that time and saw most of this. She then went back to take care of the cabin. I did tell her I was going to inform the Captain and ask for ground assistance. I did call the Captain; however; at that time; they were being diverted due to runway issues in ZZZ so he told me he would get back to me. I stayed in the galley waiting for the Captain to call. I was cleaning up when this passenger; who had been mumbling and talking most of this time; came up at me again; backing me up saying I was going down the wrong path with him. I firmly told him to sit down. The Captain called and informed the crew of the diversion and ZZZ issues. He asked about the passenger situation. I quickly gave a summary and asked for ground assistance. We diverted to ZZZ1. On landing; this passenger jumped up to get his bags saying he was leaving. Ops met the plane and police were quickly there along with ground Supervisor. I gave a statement to police. We received witness names and numbers along with a statement from a passenger who witnessed this passenger in [departure airport] in the gate area. This was given to police.Stop allowing passengers that are clearly under the influence of something to board. I don't know what else to say. These passengers are allowed and enabled. There should be no arguement or debate. If someone is asking if you have been drinking or taking medication; then it's a pretty good bet your behavior brought attention to you. Flight crew DOES look out for these issues. Our FAR states we cannot let them onboard. WE do not! We bring attention to the OPS agent or Supervisor or; our Captains; and then we are continually told 'they are fine' or 'they will sleep' or 'this is the last flight out'. Someone has to stop allowing this. Deny boarding; and stopenabling this behavior. Alcohol related issues are one of the biggest conversations among crew. [The passengers] expect ENDLESS alcohol. Drugs are unseen and are hard to detect but just as dangerous; and then you mix the two. Something has to be done to stop allowing this without there being serious consequences to the passenger! This situation has shown me just how vulnerable we are. I could have been physically hurt. I was trapped by this man. For the entire flight; I was on the highest alert in my head. My anxiety level hit me after we landed back in base. I am still having anxiety each time I have to file a report. My passengers could have been hurt. My Captain was busy with a last minute flight diversion due to runway issues in ZZZ; and had to acknowledge this situation. This puts everyone in harm's way. This man should NEVER have been ALLOWED on this aircraft. One of the witness statements was that he observed this man in [departure airport] and was shocked he was allowed on the aircraft at the very last minute. 74 people were trapped at 35K with him. I am not Management; I do not get to have a say in how our passengers are handled. I only know I; my crew; and the rest of the passengers are put at risk for the sake of ONE individual.,,,,B737-700 Flight Attendant reported a passenger became enough of an issue that police met the aircraft at destination.,"An incident occurred on a B737-700 flight involving a disruptive passenger. The passenger boarded late, exhibited unusual behavior, and was observed struggling with his luggage and appearing fatigued. Despite concerns raised by the flight attendants about his instability, he was allowed to board. During the flight, the passenger displayed erratic behavior, including repeated attempts to locate restrooms and falling in the aisle. He became confrontational with a flight attendant, taking her photo and refusing to delete it, leading to a safety concern. The flight attendant informed the captain, who was managing a runway diversion. Upon landing, the passenger was met by police, and the flight attendant filed a report. A witness statement supported concerns about the passenger's behavior. The incident highlighted the need for stricter boarding procedures to identify and prevent passengers under the influence from flying, emphasizing the importance of denying boarding in such cases to ensure passenger and crew safety.",between attendant and passengers

Additionally the passenger reported he saw smoke emanating from the overhead panel in the lavatory. Uncharacteristic of him simply smoking in the lavatory; but possibly something much more serious and potentially life-threatening; an actual aircraft fire. The smoke alarm was activated and projecting an extremely loud and piercing tone throughout the cabin. This caused distress among passengers as well as the FA's. Communicating with the FA's over the interphone was very difficult due to the combined chaotic nature of the alarm and the chaos surrounding its activation. The FA's were having difficulty extinguishing the alarm. I did not know if this was due to continued smoke; or some delay in extinguishing the alarm. Our collective belief was the situation could be much more serious. The FA's asked me for assistance in evaluating the situation. I knew my assistance in the aft of the aircraft would be a departure from our standard protocol. However; based on the information we received at the time; I concluded my assistance might very well mitigate a further degradation in the cabin and secure a safe condition as quickly as possible. The First Officer had demonstrated confidence and technical competence; thus I had no reason to doubt her ability to navigate and control the aircraft; as well as communicate with outside agencies while I assisted the FA's with what appeared and sounded to be a rapidly deteriorating situation. In the interest of time and consequently safety; I elected to personally inspect and evaluate the severity of the incident. I did this in order to determine the most expeditious course of action regarding continuing to [our destination] or turning back.As we were mere minutes from the critical point on our flight plan there was only one FA present in the forward part of the aircraft during the time I exited the flight deck. I shut the flight deck door before the forward FA could enter the flight deck. After working with the FA's to silence the alarm and after inspecting the lavatory and it's overhead panel; I determined there was no immediate threat of an actual aircraft fire; as there was no evidence of heat; burning; or residual smoke. I instructed the FA's to lock the lavatory; and reassess every few minutes. After I returned to the front of the aircraft; I established communication with the First Officer via interphone; and advised her I was ready to return to the flight deck; (after approximately 4-5 minutes). The smoke did not continue; so I opted to continue to [our destination]; as long as the condition didn't reappear. For reasons unknown to me; the First Officer left her seat to open the door rather than pushing the unlock button. About twenty minutes later; the FA's found an electronic cigarette in the toilet that was discarded in what appears to be an attempt to conceal its presence and cause for the smoke. After the passenger (who reported the smoke emanating from the overhead portion of the lavatory) was asked about the device; he did admit it was the cause for the smoke and activation of the smoke detector. I felt in the interest of safety; it was best to leave the flight deck and assess the situation personally; and that would be the most expeditious way to evaluate an overall course of action.At no time during the above events did I intentionally disregard standard procedure; rather I utilized my authority as the Captain to bring the situation to safe conclusion while being mindful of [Company policies].,,,,B737 Captain reported leaving the flight deck to evaluate smoke in the aft lav caused by a passenger's electronic cigarette.,"The incident involved a B737 flight crew responding to smoke in the aft lavatory, which was traced to a passenger's electronic cigarette. Upon notification, the smoke alarm activated, causing cabin chaos. The captain, departing from standard protocol, left the flight deck to personally assess the situation, concluding no immediate fire hazard existed. After extinguishing the alarm and inspecting the lavatory, the captain instructed the flight attendants to lock the lavatory and monitor the situation. Despite the First Officer's departure from standard procedure by opening the flight deck door, the captain returned and decided to continue the flight to the destination. Later, the flight attendants found the electronic cigarette, confirming its role in the incident. The captain's actions prioritized safety, aligning with company policies.",between attendant and passengers

We were about 3.5 hours from our destination. The Chief Purser called the cockpit and advised me that we had an elderly passenger; flying with her granddaughter; experiencing some confusion. She advised me that the passenger has a history of dementia and that her granddaughter had also advised her of that Ms. X was experiencing some confusion and anxiety. She has some difficulty seeing (was told that she was somewhat blind but could see light and some shapes); in addition Ms. X didn't speak English. We found someone to interpret; but Ms. X was unresponsive; uncooperative and was unable to understand what was going on. I was flying; so I had the last break; so I (the Captain) went back to see what assistance I could offer. I found Ms. X agitated and not responding to verbal commands. I was advised that she wanted to open the door and get out; she kept telling the interpreter that she wanted to see her daughter 'right now' (the daughter was waiting for Ms. X to connect to another flight; and was going to pick her up). I observed her trying to go for the door; and she became somewhat combative; in addition she began to 'chant' out loud. I talked to the Doctor and Nurse who had offered to help and asked their advice. It was decided that we would let her stand in the aisle way and try and tire herself out (she refused any liquids or medication). I requested an F/A to remain at the door. I didn't want to force her to sit down; and I didn't want to have to restrain her; due to her frail stature and age. I had requested the two pilots in the cockpit to contact Dispatch and advise them of the situation; and our desire to have medical meet the airplane. I discussed the option of diverting with the Doctor and the Nurse; they thought that she could be managed; and that they would keep an eye on her. I elected to continue the flight. I ordered the cabin lights to be turned on in the hope that she would feel a little more secure. I returned to my seat and tried to resume my break. A few minutes later I was advised that she was becoming agitated and aggressive again. I returned to the cabin and after a discussion with the Doctor and Nurse; I ordered her to be put in an aisle with three seats so that the Nurse could sit on one side and the interpreter could sit on the other and keep her secure. It should be noted that by this time she had become a little more familiar with them and was responding somewhat to their voices. She did not want to sit down; so we had to hold her hands down while we physically put her in the seat. This was done with the help of myself; the Doctor; the Nurse; her granddaughter and another F/A. We got her into the seat and buckled her in; while the Nurse and Translator positioned themselves on either side of her. Ms. X calmed down; but did experience a few more episodes of agitation and aggressive behavior. I again questioned them of their ability to keep her calm. If the situation continued; or got worse; I was going to divert and get her off the airplane. They assured me that they could handle her; and there was no further incident for the rest of the trip. When we arrived; the Paramedics were standing by and had to restrain her to get her out of the jet. We thanked all who were involved; and told them how much we appreciated their assistance and consideration. I elected not to call for a Security level 1 or 2; after discussing it with the crew. Ms. X was clearly confused and suffering from Dementia; I did not feel she was a threat to the flight; only to herself. Her agitation and aggressiveness appeared to be due to her confusion and fear; I witnessed no malice or desire for violence. Because of her advance age and frail stature; I saw no real or immediate threat. The event was one of medical nature; and not a security threat.,,,,B777 Captain reported a passenger with dementia and poor eyesight experienced confusion and anxiety on an international oceanic flight.

Due to her confusion and anxiety, Ms. X became agitated and unresponsive, expressing a desire to exit the aircraft. The cabin crew, including an interpreter, attempted to assist her, but she remained uncooperative. The Captain intervened, consulted with a physician and nurse on board, and decided to let her stand in the aisle to calm down. When her agitation worsened, the crew helped her sit down with medical assistance, and she was restrained upon landing by paramedics. The flight continued without diversion, as the medical team assured the Captain they could manage the situation. The incident was deemed a medical issue rather than a security threat.",between attendant and passengers

She had deplaned to retrieve her uncle's medication from the security check point (located in main terminal). We departed; requiring a tram ride from main terminal; where security is located. I was completely unaware a passenger had deplaned during boarding--I was busy doing catering checks; prepping galley; loading ovens; pre-departure beverages; making PA's etc. FA3 was occupied hanging coats and serving the drinks. Boarding was going on this entire time. FA4 stated she believed FA3 and I were aware a PAX had deplaned because boarding was held up briefly for PAX to come forward through First Class to deplane. I was not aware of this; FA2 stated he thought the passenger was coming forward to give a bag to the agent for checking. He stated as the PAX rounded the closet with her bag he proceeded back down the aisle to perform his duties so did not actually see the PAX deplane. Apparently there was an agent at the door but I had zero awareness of any of these goings on. I was task saturated. FA4 states she told PAX to take her carryon baggage and tell the agent what she was doing. Upon my awareness of the incident I spoke to the remainder of her traveling party. My conversation with family confirmed [the] PAX had deplaned with carry on; she had checked luggage; she did not return to aircraft; she returned to main terminal security check point to retrieve [her uncle's] medication kit bag; and she did not make it back to the plane. Family had been in text contact with her and their main concern was how would she get out of ZZZ; what flight would she be on? When asked why they did not notify the cabin crew that PAX had not returned before we left the gate [the uncle] said essentially 'we knew the plane would wait anyway.' I said that may or may not be the case depending on where she was in the process; but we really needed to account for her; for security sake and for her sake and for your peace of mind. They were very kind and calm about the incident; their only concern was how/when [she] would get to [destination].I then briefed the Captain with all I knew of the incident. He was able to contact dispatch and confirm that the PAX was #1 on the Stand By list for [another] flight; with that flight showing 4 open seats at the time. I informed [the uncle]. They continued to text and make positive contact at various times; to include upon landing.Besides the obvious breach in procedure; potential security concerns; and anxiety for the family-the Captain and I became concerned about how many souls we actually had on board. At door close the agent first said 149. Then another agent came back down and said 151; but didn't explain how/why it changed. Then door closed. So now...with PAX deplaning and NOT returning...how many Souls On Board did we really have?In retrospect I recalled an agent stating something to the effect of all the passengers having made it 'except for that one.' I don't know if that is in reference to [the deplaning PAX] or another revenue passenger who didn't make the flight. A 'time-out' to ensure all FAs are aware of what is happening- especially FA1 who is ultimately responsible for ensuring procedure is properly followed. Boarding should have been stopped- FA4 should have escorted the PAX and handed her off to me; or directly to the agent who was standing by; but definitely brief me on the situation. Communication. Slow down. Be deliberate. I feel awful about this event- I feel bad for the family. I am terrified that I let this happen on my watch for the security implication of such an incident. Thankful it had an innocent outcome; but I realize how serious it could be. I have learned a great deal and will include this in my future preflight briefings with my crews. Also; if the plane had crashed...how many pairs of shoes ARE we looking for? That scares me too. I don't know as anyone really knows and am beyond thankful that did not happen. Ask the captain--I was shaken to the core about this for those very reasons and the implications therein. The responsibility weighs heavy and I accept it completely. I feel terrible for what happened and am thankful there were no worse outcomes than some worry and inconvenience for the family. Lesson learned. Thank you.,,,,An Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that she was notified by another Flight Attendant that a passenger did not return to the aircraft after she deplaned during boarding.,"An incident occurred during a flight operation involving two flight attendants (FA1 and FA4) and a passenger who deplaned during boarding but did not return to the aircraft. The passenger had left the aircraft to retrieve her uncle's medication from the security checkpoint in the main terminal. FA1 was unaware of the situation due to being occupied with pre-flight tasks, such as catering checks, galley preparation, and loading ovens. FA3, another flight attendant, believed the passenger was returning a bag to the agent and did not notice her deplaning. FA4 notified FA1 of the incident after the fact. FA1 informed the passenger's family, who confirmed that the passenger had not returned to the aircraft and was at the security checkpoint. The family expressed concern about how the passenger would reach her destination. FA1 briefed the captain, who confirmed that the passenger was on the standby list for another flight with available seats. Despite the resolution, the incident raised concerns about communication protocols, the number of souls on board, and potential security risks. The flight attendant expressed regret for the lapse in procedure and acknowledged the importance of clear communication and halting boarding to ensure all passengers were accounted for. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and adherence to safety protocols among the flight attendant team. The flight attendant committed to incorporating this lesson into future pre-flight briefings and emphasized the importance of ensuring passenger accountability for safety and security.",between attendant and passengers

We called the flight attendants and (in accordance with standard operating procedures) the FO stepped out of the cockpit and a FA came in; closing the cockpit door behind him. While the FO was in the lavatory; a female passenger came up to the forward galley. The FA informed her that she must use one of the lavatories in the back of the aircraft or return to her seat; but that she could not remain in the forward galley. The passenger was Hispanic and claimed not to understand the FA. Luckily; all three of the FAs spoke fluent Spanish and it was again explained in Spanish. The passenger still refused to move and she verbally abused and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA came up to assist. The 'A' FA called up to inform me what was going on. I could hear loud voices over the interphone and the FAs speaking to the passenger in Spanish. Meanwhile; the FO had exited the lavatory and was now also in the galley. After several more minutes; the passenger's husband came up and convinced her to return to her seat. After she was seated and with the three FAs plus the male deadheading FA guarding and blocking access to the forward galley and the cockpit door; the cockpit door was opened and the FA exited the cockpit and the FO entered. We then locked down the cockpit in accordance with a Threat Level 1. I contacted Dispatch with our status and requested to have law enforcement meet the aircraft in ZZZ. After arriving in ZZZ; law enforcement removed the passenger from the aircraft.After speaking with the FO over the interphone; and visually confirming the galley was secure; I determined that it was safer and more prudent to have the FO in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. This scenario needs to be addressed during recurrent security training. What is the safest course of action if the cockpit is locked down with one of the pilots in the cabin? If it is determined that keeping the cockpit on lockdown is the safest course; where should the FA sit? In the jumpseat or in a pilot seat?,The reporter stated that this encounter with a passenger was more of a misunderstanding; but it brought up the bigger issue of what to do if the threat is real. If a real threat was just outside the cockpit door with the first officer out of the cockpit with a single pilot and flight attendant in the cockpit; what is the proper procedure? Do you put the FA in the pilot's seat where they have access to the flight controls; but you can keep an eye on him/her? Do you put the FA in the jumpseat where you can't see them? The reporter mused 'could the FA be in on it'; what is really happening on the other side of the door? The reporter stated that he feels unprepared for which procedure should the pilot use for these type of scenarios. He feels more training should occur addressing these issues.,,,B737-800 Captain reported that a passenger refused to leave the forward galley while the First Officer was using the forward lavatory causing a security issue.,"The incident occurred during the cruise phase of a B737-800 flight about 45 minutes prior to landing at ZZZ. The First Officer (FO) required a physiological break and temporarily left the cockpit to use the forward lavatory. A flight attendant (FA) entered the cockpit in accordance with standard procedures, closing the door behind them. During the FO's absence, a Hispanic passenger approached the forward galley. The FA instructed the passenger to either use one of the rear lavatories or return to her seat, as she was not permitted to remain in the galley. The passenger, who did not understand English, was initially uncooperative. However, the three FAs, who spoke fluent Spanish, repeatedly explained the situation. Despite this, the passenger refused to comply, verbally abused, and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA was called to assist. The 'A' FA informed the Captain via interphone, who heard loud voices and ongoing dialogue between the FAs and the passenger in Spanish. The FO, having exited the lavatory, joined the situation in the galley. After several minutes, the passenger's husband intervened and persuaded her to return to her seat. With the passenger seated and the FAs, including the male deadheading FA, positioned to block access to the forward galley and cockpit door, the cockpit door was opened. The FA exited the cockpit, and the FO returned. The cockpit was then secured in accordance with Threat Level 1 protocols. Upon arrival at ZZZ, law enforcement was summoned to remove the passenger from the aircraft. The Captain, after consulting with the FO and visually confirming the galley's security, determined it was safer for the FO to remain in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight.

I was working in A position on the aircraft; a sold out flight with two jump seats occupied. A pre-boarding Customer was listed on my specials report as having a vision impairment and having a working assistance animal. I met the Customer in the jetbridge and offered my assistance; to which he refused. The Customer's service animal appeared to be a full sized golden lab.The Customer proceeded to sit in a bulkhead row aisle seat on this aircraft. I informed the Customer that he would need to sit in the window seat so that his service animal would not hinder the egress of Customers sitting outboard of him. The Customer informed me that he was not going to move to the window seat; that he knew his rights and that he had every right to sit in the aisle seat and that he didn't have to occupy the window seat if he didn't want too. He informed me that his dog was not going to be in the aisle and would not obstruct the aisle. I explained to him that the aisle was not my greatest concern; that the animal was in fact obstructing access to the aisle for the two yet to be occupied seats. The Customer still refused to move. Sensing that the customer was going to be difficult to deal with; I simply replied with; 'Ok' and continued with the boarding process.I pulled out my EFAM (Flight Attendant Manual) and conducted a search to make sure that I was in-line with [Company] policies and procedures. I also asked assistance from my B to help with the search so I could face my customers as they boarded the aircraft. Our search quickly found what we were looking for. [In the FAM] it stipulates that an assistance animal 'May not obstruct an aisle or access to an aisle.'  I informed a ramp agent in the jetbridge that I would need a representative to address the situation and they informed my Ops Agent. I informed my Captain of the situation.Boarding was complete and I still didn't have a representative. Ops Agent again called and Ops Supervisor came to assist. I explained the situation to Ops Sup and Captain and showed them the aforementioned FAM requirements for assistance animals. Captain reviewed the FAM for several minutes to ensure there was no grey area around the policies and procedures. We as a team; all 4 Flight Attendants; our Captain; our Ops Agent and our Ops Supervisor all found ourselves in agreement that the Customer with the assistance animal would need to sit in the window seat in order to meet our safety regulations. Ops Sup was tasked with engaging the Customer with the assistance animal and asking him to swap seats to the window seat. Ops Sup explained everything to the Customer and was rejected just as I was; but this time with all the seats full of Customers; Ops Sup found himself at the end of the stick. Customers who had no reason to be engaged in the conversation with Ops Sup found themselves yelling at Ops Sup; telling him that the disabled Customer had rights and that he didn't have to move if he didn't want too. Ops Sup left the aircraft and made a call to Customer Service to get their stance on the conflict. They backed the direction of the FAM and crew and directed Ops Sup to again ask the Customer with the assistance animal to move one last time or to remove him from the flight for non-compliance with safety regulations. Again; Ops Sup engaged the Customer and the Customer refused to move. He even said that he wasn't getting off the aircraft; period. With that Ops Sup was left with only one option; to call the police and have the Customer physical removed from the aircraft for his refusal to comply with the required safety regulations. After 10 minutes of waiting for the police; Ops Sup called the police again as they still hadn't shown up. The Customers in the row tried repeatedly to get the Customer with the assistance animal to move to the window seat but he refused. Everyonejust wanted to get the flight under way.After nearly 30 minutes the Customer with the assistance animal finally agreed to take the window seat; at the convincing of the Customers in his row. He was angry and told everyone that this was going to be their last day on the job. He stated that he wasn't going to leave the [arrival] airport until he had received justice for the injustices against him. The police never showed up. During the flight the Customer showed no aggression and other than using the forward lavatory three times; stayed in the window seat. He had a Jack and Coke which I comped. Upon arrival; the Ops Agent approached me regarding a known difficult Customer. I gave him the rundown of what happened so that he could alert his leadership team. The Customer and his supporters did in fact give the Customer Service and Ops team a difficult time in the gate area. Leadership informed the Customer that he needed to get in touch with Customer Service.Customers need to abide by the required safety regulations; including Customers with disabilities. Maybe the ACAA (Air Carrier Access Act) could assist the airlines and their members by informing their members of what they can do to avoid conflict on an aircraft and how follow the safety regulations that airlines must enforce. As for flight crews; everyone must be on the same page in enforcing the safety regulations. When one crew lets safety slide; the rest of us hear about it from the Customers.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported an encounter with a visually handicapped; dog-assisted passenger who refused a window seat thus failing to comply with company aisle obstruction regulations. The passenger voluntarily moved to a window seat after a threatened removal from the flight.,"The incident involved a visually impaired passenger with a service dog on a sold-out flight. The flight attendant requested the passenger to move to a window seat to prevent obstruction of aisle access, as per company policies. The passenger refused, citing his rights, leading to a prolonged delay as the crew and supervisors attempted to resolve the issue. The situation escalated when the police were threatened with being called, though they didn't arrive. Eventually, other passengers persuaded the man to move, allowing the flight to proceed. The passenger remained agitated but compliant. Post-landing, he caused a scene, prompting leadership to direct him to contact customer service. The flight attendant suggested that the ACAA could aid in educating passengers to prevent such conflicts, emphasizing the need for consistent enforcement of safety regulations.",between attendant and passengers

I made appropriate periodic PAs to Passengers. Our wheels up was :50 so I told Agent and Crew to plan to push at :40. At push time no one was ready. I had to go to the top of the jet way to find the Agent and there was no Pushback Crew. As a result we were rushed despite the 50 minute delay. At this point there was a serious chance that we would not make our wheels up time. At the last moment the A Flight Attendant tossed the napkin on to the console and closed the cockpit door. The last digit of the count was illegible and I made the mistake of assuming it was correct. As we approached the runway we were cleared for immediate takeoff. I rang the cabin to notify the Flight Attendants and as we took the runway the A called up to tell us that there was a Passenger that thought he might be on the wrong aircraft. I had the First Officer instruct everyone to remain seated and that we would sort it out in the air. Above 10;000 feet I confirmed the load sheet count of 46 and compared it to the napkin count of 4 (illegible). I contacted the A who said her count was 47. Further investigation revealed that our extra Passenger was a connect for [a different airport] that had failed to exit at the last stop and remained on the aircraft despite the numerous PAs referring to our destination. I suspect that he was in the lav during the through count process. We coordinated with Dispatch to have a [customer service agent] meet him.Slow down; it's always wise to slow down. Also; our procedure of verifying the count as the very last thing to occur before push; seems like there could be a better time to discover this showstopper; especially when faced with a potentially significant delay if an error is detected. Maybe I haven't been paying attention but I ride other airlines and I've never seen flight attendants actually count Passengers before pushback. The potential error chain has too many links with our system.,,[Report narrative contained no additional information.],,B737NG flight crew reported they departed with an unaccounted passenger onboard.,"The incident arose from a miscount of passengers during the boarding process, resulting in an unaccounted extra passenger on board. The flight experienced a 50-minute gate hold after boarding was complete. Despite periodic passenger announcements, the pushback was delayed due to unprepared staff and missing pushback crew. At pushback, the flight attendant provided an illegible passenger count, leading the captain to assume the count was correct. Takeoff was approved, and the cabin was notified. Shortly after taking the runway, the flight attendant reported a passenger concerned about being on the wrong aircraft. The captain instructed everyone to remain seated and planned to address the issue in flight. Upon reaching 10,000 feet, the load sheet showed 46 passengers, while the flight attendant's count was 47. The discrepancy revealed an extra passenger, a connecting passenger who had not exited at the previous stop, found in the lavatory during the count. The crew coordinated with dispatch to have a customer service agent meet the passenger at the destination. The flight had to divert to resolve the issue, causing delays and operational challenges. The extra passenger was offloaded, and the aircraft was prepared for the next leg. The captain suggested revising the passenger counting procedure, possibly conducting counts earlier or more thoroughly to prevent such errors, noting that other airlines may handle this process differently. This incident highlights the importance of accurate passenger counting and the potential benefits of revising current procedures to minimize errors.",between attendant and passengers

At the time of walk through his seatbelt was undone was under his feet in aisle and newspaper was under his feet. I requested he stow bag and laptop and fasten seatbelt and asked if newspaper was trash could I take it for him. He said no he was reading it so I asked him to remove it from floor in exit row so no one would get hurt if we actually had to use exit; then I continued down aisle. On passing him on my way back he still had not complied with one thing I said. I seriously thought about removing him from exit seat; but did not want to escalate situation. So I made the same request AGAIN. He told me he was keeping his laptop on his lap because he could. I was wrong. I then informed him that I was not wrong and that it was in my manual as such and I would be happy to show him. Finally he said I will put it away but you are wrong and then told to LEAVE HIM ALONE. I talked to the CA of the situation. CA told me to show him in magazine where it is required to stow laptops. I didn't because as I said it would have escalated.

After 2 minutes; the FA called and reported she was out and feeling better. We asked 'are you sure?' The FA said yes. We taxied; took off; and flew for an hour and 20 minutes without incident. At this time; they called to report our meals were ready. I asked about the ill passenger; and the FA told me there were 20-25 sick people in the back. Vomiting; diarrhea; etc. At this point; we knew we had an issue.

A lot of passengers in the cabin got up out of their seats. Took their luggage out of the overhead bins and used the lavatories. The bins were open the aisle was blocked by bags. I made an announcement to let everyone know they should stay seated if they didn't need to use the lavatories and keep all luggage stowed so when it is time to taxi to the gate [we'll be] ready.Then I called the cockpit and spoke with [the] Captain and told him maybe that wasn't such a good idea. We will need a few minutes to get all passengers seated and make sure the cabin is secure. He said okay. Then 7 minutes later he made an announcement that our gate was open and for everyone to take their seats. We made an announcement for everyone to take their seats. Make sure bags were stowed and setbacks and tray tables were in their upright position. When we were doing our checks the phone chimed.I went to go answer it and when I got to the phone we were already moving.

I could hear through my headset and the flight deck door some sort of commotion that sounded like voices. I thought it was slightly unusual; but we were close to landing; [and] I wasn't sure if the flight attendants were simply doing their last minute duties before landing. On the landing rollout turn onto a high speed taxiway; we got a call from the flight attendants. My Captain and I recognized it and both agreed we were going to address it as soon as we completed our after landing duties since we were still slowing down and in a very high workload environment between the normal flows; checklist; and call to ops. Before we could complete our after landing flows; however; the flight attendants then called using the 'emergency' call button. The Captain immediately stopped the plane and informed ATC while I talked to the flight attendants. The flight attendants told us we had a belligerent passenger; who had taken her seat belt off during approach and was walking around the cabin. I relayed this information to the Captain. We tried to ascertain what the current status of the passenger was to determine if she was still a threat. The flight attendants said she had returned to her seat with her seat belt fastened. Following the Captain's direction; I asked the flight attendant if they thought we needed a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) to meet us at the gate; since the information we were getting appeared to indicate that the passenger had returned to her seat and fastened her seat belt and was complying. After a pause and the flight attendant's clear hesitation on making this decision; I suggested that we'd have a LEO meet us at the gate; which the flight attendants agreed was a good decision. I called ops; and worked through arranging a LEO to meet us at the gate. Unfortunately; in the chaos ops didn't know we were on the ground in LAX because our ACARS had failed midair on that leg. This resulted in some delay getting the ground crew to the gate to marshal us in and then waiting for the LEO to meet us at the gate after we had parked. We delayed deplaning the aircraft until the LEO could escort the passenger off the plane.I saw the passenger briefly in the jet bridge hitting the LEO while the LEO explained to her that she would be arrested [if] she didn't stop. I left to do my walk around; and when I returned; I saw her being carried away in handcuffs by two LEOs up the jet bridge.As the incident occurred we were informed that it was alcohol-related; and the passenger was clearly intoxicated. She had been served two alcoholic beverages during the flight; and according to the flight attendants; was perfectly normal after 1; but the second resulted in her belligerent behavior.Passengers being disruptive are a part of air travel; but there were a few lessons I learned to help make it smoother with less operational disruptions. First; explain to the flight attendants that they should let us know quickly if there's a potential problem. On final approach; one of us could conceivably have answered a call early on knowing there was simply an issue with a passenger. Then we could have called back when we had finished our initial after landing duties and better managed the workload.While the Captain and I performed great CRM during the whole event (clearly dividing who was doing what - Captain did taxiing and communicating with ATC while I talked with the flight attendants and coordinated with ops); things changed when our first form of communication with the flight attendants was after they had pushed the emergency call button. The Captain and I both feared when we saw that light go on that we might have been on fire or some other emergency requiring evacuation onto the taxiway. The Captain later informed the flight attendants that we were going to get to the situation as quickly as it was safe to do so; but the emergency callbutton might not have been necessary since at the time they called the passenger was in her seat with her seat belt fastened.Finally; I believe one of the important things for the flight attendants to learn is how much we pilots rely on them to paint a picture of what is happening in the cabin in a situation like this. Initially when they called up; it sounded like it was a minor issue that was under control and wouldn't require any special assistance; and it took a long time to come to the conclusion to pull the trigger on having security meet us at the gate. When we exited the flight deck at the gate; the Captain and I agreed that there was no doubt we needed security to meet us (and the Captain commented that if she'd been displaying that behavior when she boarded the flight; she would have still been in [departure airport] at the gate); as even though she was in her seat; she still was not complying with instructions and posing a threat to those around her (as evidenced by her repeatedly hitting the calm LEO while in the jet bridge). Having gotten this information better communicated to us would have allowed us to get to the gate quicker since we were stopped on the taxiway during the whole conversation with the flight attendants. While in this incident it did not make a difference; a different situation might result in a passenger being more physically aggressive; making a quick decision allow for a sooner end to the scenario with less damage or injury to passengers and crew. And while not as important; a quicker decision would have also mitigated some of the delay that this incident caused to the remaining flights of the day.,,,,Air Carrier First Officer reported that an unruly passenger disrupted the cabin shortly before landing.,"During a flight approaching Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), a passenger became unruly and disruptive after consuming two alcoholic beverages. The passenger removed her seatbelt during the approach, walked around the cabin, and refused to comply with crew instructions, despite returning to her seat and fastening her seatbelt. The flight attendants initially contacted the flight deck, reporting the situation. When the passenger's behavior continued to escalate, the flight attendants activated the emergency call button, prompting the flight crew to stop the aircraft and coordinate with air traffic control (ATC) and ground operations. The flight crew, with the assistance of law enforcement, delayed deplaning until the passenger could be escorted off the aircraft. The passenger was eventually removed by security after becoming physically aggressive with the law enforcement officer. The incident was attributed to alcohol-related behavior and resulted in delays due to communication challenges, as the aircraft's ACARS system had failed, complicating coordination with ground staff. The flight crew emphasized the importance of clear and timely communication from the flight attendants regarding potential cabin issues. They suggested that earlier notification of the situation could have allowed for better management of workload and a smoother response. Additionally, the flight crew highlighted the need for flight attendants to provide a more detailed account of cabin events to help pilots assess the situation accurately and make informed decisions.",between attendant and passengers

None of them spoke English; making communication very difficult. The mother was seated next to one of the boys with the girl and a boy behind her and one boy in front of her. The girl appeared to be the youngest and was about 3 or 4 years old. When we secured the cabin before door closure they were all in their seat belts; but after we closed the MCD (Main Cabin Door) and started the safety pre-departure announcement and demo; the little girl got out of her seat and stood next to her mother. The mother made no effort to get her child back in her seat. We stopped the demo and I managed to get her back in her seat belt and tried to indicate to her brother that she needed to stay there. We finished the demo; secured the cabin and taxied out to the runway. We were in line to take off and were expecting our takeoff chime when the little girl got up again. This time the mother picked her up and put her on her lap. Even though she appeared to be over two years of age; I felt that getting up to rectify the situation at that phase of the flight was not safe as it would take some time to get her settled again and decided to leave the child held on her mother's lap for takeoff. As soon as it was safe for us to get up; I went back to the mother and decided to rearrange the children to try to avoid a repeat incident. I tried to indicate that the little boy sitting next to her should go to the row behind and that she should strap the little girl into the seat next to her. There was very little cooperation from any of them; including the mother; but I finally got the little boy strapped into the seat one row back and the little girl seated next to her mother and in her seat belt. She fell asleep and stayed there for the rest of the flight.There was a big language barrier and complete lack of understanding of airplane safety and regulations. They not only did not speak English; but hardly spoke at all (even to each other). The family boarded last and had been escorted out to the plane; presumably so that they would know where to go. I did not realize until after we closed the door that none of the family spoke English and there was no information on the paperwork. When the little girl got up the first time; during the demo; I alerted the flight deck that we might have a problem with an unsecured child over two years old. When I got her seated; the CA (Captain) said that if she was secured; we were going to go. I thought that I had succeeded in making someone in the family understand that she needed to be in her seat belt and that she wouldn't get up again; so we proceeded to taxi out and get in line for takeoff.,,[Report narrative contained no additional information.],,Air carrier Flight Attendants reported having difficulty getting a non-English speaking family to understand and comply with safety procedures and regulations.,"The incident involved a language barrier and lack of understanding of airplane safety regulations by a non-English speaking family consisting of a mother and four young children (three boys and one girl). During the pre-departure safety demonstration, the youngest child repeatedly left her seat, and the mother failed to ensure compliance with safety protocols. The flight attendant intervened, securing the child initially but facing resistance when attempting to rearrange the seating during takeoff. Due to safety concerns and time constraints, the flight attendant allowed the mother to hold the child during takeoff. Post-takeoff, the flight attendant successfully rearranged the children, securing the youngest girl in her seat. The language barrier and lack of cooperation from the family posed significant challenges, but the flight attendant managed the situation to ensure a safe flight. The proposed solution involved persistent communication and adjustments to seating arrangements to prevent further incidents.",between attendant and passengers

Several passengers at mid cabin and aft cabin were non-compliant of takeoff instructions and the D and B FA were addressing the issue. Securing the cabin was taking a little longer than normal due to non-compliant passengers. Pilots signaled the cleared for takeoff ding. The 'A' flight attendant did not answer and confirm with pilots that cabin was secured due to the fact that flight attendants were still addressing non-compliant passengers. 'A' flight attendant observed aircraft taxi onto runway and immediately went into take off phase. 'A' flight attendant immediately made pa announcement to all flight attendants to take their seats and secure themselves. 'A' flight attendant was not able to notify the Captain in time to delay take off due to sterile flight deck. Captain did not ask for verbal confirmation if cabin and flight attendants were secured. When we landed and Captain was informed of what happen; there was no concern or remorse from his part and when asked why did he takeoff without confirming cleared for takeoff signal from the 'A' flight attendant his response was 'I heard talk so I assumed you were secured.' I feel there was a breakdown in communication between pilots and flight attendants.Breakdown in communication occurred between the pilots and flight attendants and needs to be addressed. A more paced taxi should take place to allow flight attendants enough time to secure the cabin; galleys and themselves in jump seats including performing the emergency demo on a very short taxi especially at smaller airports. And finally we should possibly add to the present response we have in place to the pilots [something to the effect of reminding passengers to check your seat belts and that the cabin and flight attendants are secure.],,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported a takeoff before the cabin was secured due to some noncompliant passengers and no communication with the flight crew.,"The incident occurred on a B737 flight during which non-compliant passengers delayed the cabin securing process, as the flight attendants were occupied with addressing their behavior. When the pilots signaled clearance for takeoff, the 'A' flight attendant, unable to confirm with the captain due to a sterile flight deck, initiated takeoff without confirmation. After landing, the captain's assumption that the cabin was secure based on hearing passenger conversation highlighted a communication breakdown. The flight attendant suggested solutions: allowing more taxi time for cabin securing, adding passenger reminders, and enhancing communication between flight crew and attendants to prevent future incidents.",between attendant and passengers

As I was contemplating asking if he needed to use his concentrator during all phases of the flight; I checked my manifest and noticed he wasn't even listed as having an O2 concentrator. As I was about to ask him a question or two; the passenger in 13B asked me if his (12B) O2 bottle ran out; would we have O2 bottles for him to use on board. I almost chuckled as I said 'he's not using O2 from a bottle; it's an O2 concentrator; but we have no info about it even being on board.' She replied that he indeed was using an O2 bottle as he has lung cancer and only 25% use of one of his lungs. I must have had a very odd look on my face as I said 'but he can't bring his own O2 bottle on board an aircraft; totally not allowed!' 'How did you get past the TSA?' She said they discovered the bottle; took it; checked it out; and returned it saying it was okay. My comment was 'they what?' 'So; no one else was informed that you had this and intended to use it on the plane? Turn it off please; now.' I went and retrieved one of our Portable Oxygen Bottles (POBs) and asked the D flight attendant to tell the A flight attendant to notify the flight deck. The passenger in 13B was the girlfriend of the passenger in 12B. She also told me he has used his own POB on many other flights before. She didn't say which airline.Being the C flight attendant; I'm not allowed to be forward of the exit rows for boarding; nor would I leave my cabin area of responsibility prior to takeoff. After takeoff; I'm setting up my cart as the B and D flight attendants are [completing other service duties]. So; not sure how I could have done anything different due to my position. Had I been working a position where I would have seen Mr. [12 B] on what I would have assumed was an O2 concentrator; I would have looked at my manifest to see if he was listed as using one. I would have then asked him if he needed to use it during all phases of flight including takeoff and landing; where I may have asked to move him to a window seat so as not to block/hamper other passengers egress to the main aisle in an emergency. That exchange most likely would have brought about a discovery of an O2 bottle and not a concentrator.I think lesson #1 is never assume a darn thing! Many passengers are not aware they need to disclose plans to use an O2 concentrator and I have watched them come onboard only to discover they aren't listed on my manifest. I then have time to contact an agent to see if they are aware of it and it just hasn't showed up on my manifest yet. I strongly suggest all flight attendants be very aware of passengers using O2 and watch for the device when passengers are boarding; then verify we all know about it. None of that would have mattered in this instance as his O2 bottle was concealed in a small black oblong bag. Boarding an aircraft is a crazy busy time for all concerned. All the more reason to be alert then; as well as any time after takeoff; to things like a passengers using (what should only be) an O2 concentrator and checking to make sure they are listed in our manifest or the proper tag has been placed on it by our agents.,,,,Flight Attendant reported discovering a lung cancer patient inhaling oxygen from a personal bottle not listed on the manifest. The bottle was turned off and replaced with an onboard bottle.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a passenger in seat 12B, diagnosed with lung cancer, used a personal oxygen bottle not listed on the manifest. The flight attendant, initially unaware, was informed by the passenger's girlfriend that TSA had permitted the bottle. Upon realizing the bottle's presence, the flight attendant retrieved an onboard portable oxygen bottle, instructed the passenger to turn off his personal device, and notified the cockpit. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of verifying oxygen device usage and being vigilant during boarding to prevent similar occurrences. The result was the passenger switching to the provided onboard bottle.",between attendant and passengers

My first officer and I also discussed the likely possibility of a fuel spill somewhere near us on the ramp. In my experience on the MD-80 it is not uncommon to get a faint; exhaust like fume smell in the air conditioning system; and thick condensation during hot; muggy summer nights such as this one was in ZZZ. I assume the smell was stronger in the cabin than in the cockpit since both the FO and I had our air vents closed. The flight attendants requested that I make a PA stating that everything was ok and there was no cause for alarm and we are aware of the condensation and smell; which I did. The two forward flight attendants also informed me that 'they opened the doors in back' which I thought meant that the two rear flight attendants had opened the rear aircraft doors for ventilation. Our number three and one FAs; meant to inform me that passengers were exiting through the over wing exits. This was a simple misunderstanding that was caused by task saturation in the cockpit; monitoring the APU indications; and determining the cause of the smell. I was later informed that passengers took it upon themselves to open all four over wing exits and exit onto the wing. I was told that it was estimated that 15-20 people were on each wing at one point. Our number two flight attendant vocally told passengers to stop exiting through the over wing exits. The FA had no chance to prevent passengers from initiating the uncommanded evacuation given the crowded aisle and interior that is typical of everyone standing when the seat belt sign is turned off. Our number four flight attendant made a PA instructing passengers to stop and to not evacuate or exit though the over wing exits. I did not hear this PA. The FO and I opened our air vents and the fuel odor got stronger and the condensation thickened. I then shut off the Ram Air; APU AIR switch; and both packs; which caused the fuel smell to lessen considerably in intensity and the condensation stopped completely. A man who works the ramp came up to the cockpit and told us we had fuel leaking out of the APU. I then told him to connect external power and I began to shut down the APU. I also told the first officer to go outside and inspect the APU fuel leak with the ops personnel. We informed ground of the fuel leak and we requested ARFF to come inspect the area as a precaution; which they did. I was told by the gate agent that only one person had jumped off the left wing. I was told by operations and my flight attendants that a few passengers came back into the airplane through the over wing doors; and the rest exited the wings on baggage belt loaders. There were no injuries that I know of. This was confirmed by all four flight attendants and ZZZ operations personnel. Upon inspection of the APU; fuel was in fact leaking out of the non-ram door area and the fuel spill was about fifteen feet in diameter. I was instructed by maintenance to pull 5 circuit breakers; which I did; secured the airplane with the securing check; and made the appropriate entries in the maintenance logbook.,,,,A fuel odor; later identified as an APU fuel issue; was detected as passengers began to deplane at the gate. A partial; uncommanded; evacuation was initiated by several passengers via the over wing exits. No injuries were reported.,"The incident occurred after a flight arrived at Airport ZZZ and completed its parking checklist. Upon opening the L1 door, the flight crew and forward flight attendants detected a faint fuel smell, which they initially attributed to external factors such as a neighboring aircraft being fueled, the APU running, and gusty northwest winds. The flight attendants requested the cockpit to make a passenger address (PA) to reassure passengers, which was done. However, there was a misunderstanding regarding the status of the aircraft doors and exits. Passengers, believing there was an emergency, opened the over wing exits and began exiting onto the wings without authorization. Despite efforts by the flight attendants to stop the uncommanded evacuation, several passengers exited before being directed back into the aircraft. The fuel smell intensified, leading the flight crew to shut off the APU and air conditioning systems, which reduced the odor and condensation. A ground staff member informed the cockpit of a fuel leak near the APU, prompting the crew to secure the aircraft, shut down the APU, and request ARFF (Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting) support as a precaution. Maintenance personnel inspected the APU and identified a fuel leak. The crew secured the aircraft, performed the necessary checks, and documented the issue in the maintenance logbook. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further incident. The cause of the fuel odor was later identified as a fuel leak from the APU, which was addressed by maintenance.",between attendant and passengers

I immediately noticed [female passenger's] head was wrapped in surgical bandages and her face was very swollen.  Her face was so swollen; her eyes were slits. On the left side of her face was a lump about the size of an orange.  Out of concern; I greeted [her] and asked where she was sitting; my motivation being to keep an eye on her during the flight.  [Male companion] showed me his wife's ticket; 21E; an exit row seat.  I asked [female passenger] if she knew she was assigned to an exit row seat.  She did not respond and just stared at me with dull; listless eyes.  I thought she might be on some kind of pain medication as a result of her obvious medical condition.  I asked [her] if she was capable of opening an exit window and assisting in the event of an emergency.  She continued to stare blankly at me and not answer my questions.  [Male companion]; speaking for his wife; said 'of course she can!'  He told me that the gate agent assigned us these seats.  Purser witnessed [female passenger's] condition; my asking her emergency exit questions; [her] not responding and her husband responding for her.  When I told [male companion] we would need to relocate them to another economy plus seat; [he] indicated he was unwilling to have their seats changed.  At that point; [the Purser] went to find a CSR to handle the situation.The [passengers] took their seats at the exit row.  Boarding continued and my attention was soon diverted from boarding to a CSR speaking loudly to [the Purser] near me in the First Class galley.  He was challenging her judgement about [female passenger's] condition and he did not want to move the [passengers].  I offered CSR my assessment of [female passenger]; saying I believed she was not qualified or capable of assisting in an evacuation. I told him that she did not respond to my exit row verification questions and that I thought she might be on some kind of medication that would also inhibit her ability to assist. CSR was visibly not calm or controlled.  His voice was loud and he appeared to be taking our request to relocate the [passengers] out of the exit row personally.  [He] snapped back at me 'did you ask her if she was on medication?'  I replied the husband was insisting he and his wife not be moved and because the door was still open; it was not my responsibility to ask any passenger if they are on medication.  [CSR] left the plane saying he was calling his supervisor.  [Purser] went to the cockpit to inform the Captain about the problem.  The Captain supported our concern and put in his request that Customer Service reseat the [passengers]. The Captain was on the jet bridge; talking to the Customer Service supervisor and CSR. Another gate agent reseated the [passengers].  The door was closed and we took off.  Within minutes of wheels up and before the inflight announcements were made; we heard the call chime. I could see the light was near the [particular passengers] so I made my way toward the call light to where they were sitting.  [The female passenger] was unconscious; shaking and being held by her husband.  I went forward and immediately notified [Purser].  We had an emergency room doctor in 2A and he immediately responded.  [Purser] notified the cockpit and served as communicator while I assisted the doctor.  Another doctor and a surgical nurse were across the aisle from the [passengers] and they both assisted the emergency room doctor.  It was determined by the doctors that [the female passenger] had suffered a seizure and possibly a post-op blood clot to the brain or stroke.  The doctors agreed an emergency divert was necessary.  We landed in Airport ZZZ where [the female passenger] was removed by EMT.,,During boarding; I noticed a couple seated in the exit row at 21 E and F. The woman had a heavily bandaged head and her eyes did not seem to focus completely (as though she was on medication). They both had carry-on items and 2 large bed pillows at their feet; blocking access to the window exit. When I attempted to explain that the items had to be stowed; the man interrupted me and said; 'She can do it' apparently referring to her ability to open the window exit in an emergency. My flying partner indicated that they were being moved to other seats. I was very surprised to see that they had been seated in the emergency exit row to begin with and said the same to our purser; who had already brought the issue up with the CSR working the flight. As it turned out; the woman had a medical event during the flight and the plane was diverted to Airport ZZZ; where she was removed from the flight and taken to the hospital.,,Two flight attendants requested that passengers be relocated from exit row seating due to concern over the female passengers state of health. Customer Service was resistant but eventually reseated the passengers. Shortly after takeoff; the female passenger was reported to have become unconscious. A medical diversion took place where the passenger was removed from the flight.,"The incident originated from concerns raised by the flight attendant regarding a female passenger's medical condition, which included bandaged head injuries, facial swelling, and possible medication use. The passenger's husband insisted she could perform emergency exit duties, despite her unresponsive nature to relevant questions. The flight attendant sought to reseat the passenger from an exit row due to her medical state. The Customer Service Representative (CSR) initially resisted this request. After consultation with the purser and supervisor, the passengers were reseated. Post-takeoff, the female passenger experienced a medical emergency, leading to an in-flight call for medical assistance. An emergency room doctor and other medical personnel assessed her condition, diagnosed a possible seizure or clot, and recommended a diversion. The flight was diverted to Airport ZZZ, where the passenger was removed by EMTs and taken to the hospital.

I did my PAX count and handed it to the pilots; just as I was about to head back to the rear of the plane the gate agent stopped me. He then handed me two; what looked like boarding passes and said that I needed to upgrade YYD to ZZD; as she was next on the upgrade list; and also pointed out that the other paper was an interrupted travel itinerary for PAX XXD. He then told me that the PAX in XXD may have had a bit too much to drink earlier so keep an eye on him. I asked the agent if he was going to be an issue and he said that he should be fine but wanted to give us a heads up just in case. I then upgraded the PAX in YYD to ZZD and checked on the PAX in XXD and he appeared to be fine. I had no issue with him and he did not cause a scene or anything else. I then went back the aft galley and called the FA-A and told them to make the CA aware of the situation of the PAX in XXD; but to also let him know that there were no problems and we felt fine taking him with us on the flight. The PAX slept for most of the flight and did not want any snack or beverage during flight. Once we landed the PAX in XXC told FA-A as he was deplaning that the PAX in XXD had urinated in the seat during landing and was wiping the seat down as he left. FA-A told the CA and the CA called for hazmat to come clean the seat. When cleaning/doing seatbelts both I and the other FA did not touch seats XXC/D and also warned the incoming crew.My main concern is not the possibly intoxicated PAX as he was fine there were no issues at all. I'm mainly concerned about how the gate agent handled this situation. He never made the crew or CA aware of this PAX until just before shutting the main cabin door. We as a crew never had a chance to discuss the situation until it was thrown at us right as the Main Cabin Door (MCD) was being closed. These type of situations should be brought to our attention as soon as possible.

A gate agent approached them with two boarding passes: one for an upgrade request (YYD) and another for a passenger (XXD) with an interrupted travel itinerary, noting that XXD might have been intoxicated. The flight attendant upgraded YYD and monitored XXD, who appeared fine during the flight. Upon landing, passenger XXC informed the flight attendant that XXD had urinated in the seat during landing. The captain was alerted, and hazmat was called to clean the area. The flight attendants avoided the affected seats and notified the incoming crew. The flight attendant expressed concern about the gate agent's handling of the situation, stating that the crew was only informed just before the cabin door closed, leaving them unprepared. The primary issue was the lack of timely communication from the ground staff.

There seems to be a pattern of passengers not complying with flight attendant instructions. Generally seat belt sign; or getting prepared for takeoff or landing; getting up after the 10;000 feet announcement; arguing general requests regarding safety etc. Some of this I attribute to passengers using their own electronic devices and earphones prior to takeoff and landing and therefore cannot hear our announcements. Some is just a sense of entitlement and their rights to do as they wish regardless of our instructions. On this particular flight; passengers were getting up and using the restrooms on our approach. Passengers were still putting away bags in the overheads after we had completed our checks and passengers were delaying turning off lap tops after several requests for them to do so. I have delayed writing this report to see if this was isolated; but it continues to happen on the majority of my flights.,,,,A Flight Attendant reported an increase in passengers not complying with regulations and Flight Attendant instructions.,"The incident involved a flight attendant reporting an increase in passenger non-compliance with safety regulations and instructions. The flight attendant described a pattern of passengers ignoring seatbelt instructions, using restrooms during critical phases of flight, and delaying compliance with requests to stow luggage and turn off electronic devices. Passengers were also observed using electronic devices and earphones, potentially preventing them from hearing safety announcements. Additionally, the flight attendant noted a perceived sense of entitlement among some passengers, leading to disregard for instructions. The flight attendant delayed reporting to determine if the behavior was isolated but observed it consistently across multiple flights, prompting the filing of this report. No specific solution was proposed in the context.",between attendant and passengers

I asked him to stow it. He became defensive and loudly said to me 'NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED ME TO DO THAT.' I asked again; and explained it was considered a carry on and therefore needed to go in the overhead; as he had no seat in front of him to stow it underneath. He again stated he had never been told to do that. He opened it and started to remove paperwork and personal items; and the passenger next to him asked me if that was ok. I said; yes he could secure those items in his hand; but not the backpack. I then placed the backpack in the overhead.As we were on the taxiway same passenger was on his phone. Passenger behind him looked at me to get my attention and pointed; at passenger and his phone and mouthed to me 'he is on the internet.' I tapped passenger on his shoe to get his attention and asked if he was in airplane mode. He replies; loudly; 'YES I AM AND WILL YOU STOP TOUCHING ME?' I answered; 'of course.' Passenger behind him; then taps him on the shoulder and says; 'I would appreciate it if you would do as you are asked; and get off your phone.' The father of the disruptive passenger turns around and states the son is using a certain app that isn't on the internet. The passenger who spoke up; looks at me and shakes his head. The disruptive passenger does not comply. When I hear the after takeoff chime; I go to the back galley and explain to [other Flight Attendant] what has been happening. We decide to switch and she will now [takes that part of the cabin]. This switch avoided further conflict between the disruptive passenger and myself. I don't believe I committed any errors. Passenger was not receptive to following directions; or to any verbal contact with me.,,,,A Flight Attendant reported that a passenger was not compliant in regard to stowing of baggage and electronic device usage.,"The incident began when a flight attendant (Party1) noticed a passenger (Party2) with a small backpack on his lap during the final cabin walk-through. The attendant asked the passenger to stow the backpack in the overhead bin, as it was considered carry-on luggage. The passenger became defensive, refusing to comply and stating that no one had ever asked him to do so. The situation escalated when the passenger opened the backpack and began removing items, despite the attendant's instructions to secure the items but not the backpack itself. The passenger continued to disregard the attendant's directives. Later, during taxiing, the passenger was observed using a phone, which drew the attention of another passenger who questioned whether it was permitted. The attendant tapped the passenger on the shoe to address the issue, asking if he was in airplane mode. The passenger loudly confirmed but became confrontational, telling the attendant to stop touching him. The passenger seated behind him then intervened, asking the disruptive passenger to follow instructions. The father of the disruptive passenger intervened, claiming the son was using an app that was not on the internet. The attendant decided to switch cabin sections to avoid further conflict, delegating the area to another flight attendant (Party1's colleague). This action aimed to de-escalate the situation and prevent further disruption. The flight attendant believed she handled the situation appropriately and did not feel she had made any errors. The disruptive passenger remained non-compliant and unresponsive to instructions. The incident was resolved without further escalation, as the attendant successfully transferred responsibility for the area to a colleague. The flight attendant's decision to switch cabin sections and transfer responsibility to another crew member was the proposed solution to avoid further conflict.",between attendant and passengers

He flushed several times and opened the door. Flight Attendant B said; do you smell that. As soon as the words were out of her mouth I did smell it. I stopped the passenger from going to seat and asked where he put the cigarette. He denied it of course and when he opened his mouth it was as if a cloud of smoke came out. The smell was so strong. I had him stand in galley while I searched the LAV with the door opened. I opened the trash bin and pulled out the compartment. There was a bunch of paper towels and one Budweiser can (he had been drinking that). I pulled can out and smoke was coming out of the can. I called for the other Flight Attendant to get me a bunch of bottles of water while I put the can under water in the sink. I poured about 4 bottles into the can to ensure there was no possibility of a fire. He still continued to deny he did anything; but I said you were the only one drinking Budweiser and you were the only one in the LAV in the last half hour. I told him to give me his ID and go to his seat. He said 'can I talk to you?' To which I replied 'give me your ID take your seat and I will speak to you later.' Flight Attendant B notified A; who notified the Captain. Flight Attendant A made another no smoking announcement. I copied his information and filled out crewmember report of smoking. I gave him the bottom portion which notifies him that the incident will be reported to FAA. I also returned his ID. He started to say something and I stopped him. I said to him that he needed to really think about what could have happened to all of us on the aircraft because of his irresponsible and dangerous action. Had we not caught this immediately; I can't even imagine. He then pretended to sleep the remainder of the flight. The smoke detector did not go off. It should have.,,,,An A319 passenger was smoking a cigarette in the lavatory but the smoke detector failed to alert.

Flight Attendant B noticed the odor, confronted the passenger, and discovered a smoldering cigarette inside a beer can. She extinguished the cigarette by submerging the can in water and notified the other flight attendant and the captain. Flight Attendant A made a subsequent no-smoking announcement, and the passenger was required to provide his ID and return to his seat. The flight attendant reported the incident to the FAA, and the passenger was informed that the incident would be documented.

Flight attendant had been performing her normal duties. During cruise flight on our final leg of the day from we heard a knock on the flight deck door. First officer looked through the peephole and informed me a passenger was at the door. I rang the flight attendant call button and the passenger picked up the inter phone. He informed us that our flight attendant was sick and was being attended to by another passenger.  He stated that she needed medical attention. I asked him to identify any passengers in the cabin with medical training to assist in helping flight attendant. I asked him to answer the phone when I called back for more information. I declared an emergency with ATC and requested a diversion to [a nearby airport]. We were cleared direct. I notified our dispatcher via ACARS of our diversion and situation. I rang the flight attendant call button and the same passenger as before answered. I asked him if the flight attendant was conscious. He said yes. I asked him what was wrong with her. He said she has a terrible headache and she was weak. I told him we would be landing in 10 minutes and we were going to have paramedics meet the plane.First officer and I began preparations for landing. I made a passenger announcement with our diversion information and instructions to stow personal belongings; fasten seatbelts; and remain seated for landing.A couple minutes later the flight attendant called us on the inter phone. She informed me that she had a terrible headache but she believed she was able to continue the flight. I told her the decision to divert had already been made and that we would be landing in eight minutes. I asked her to remain seated for the rest of the flight.I contacted [airport operations] and gave them our ETA. We made a visual approach; landed; and taxied to the gate. Paramedics were standing by and assisted flight attendant off of the airplane. I made a PA; spoke with the station manager; and then went to check on flight attendant. The paramedics recommended a medical evaluation and that flight attendant was refusing further treatment. They had given her and she was using an oxygen mask.I asked flight attendant how she was feeling. She said she had a headache but it was better than before. I told her that it would be a good idea to follow the paramedic's advice. I told her we couldn't continue the flight and that I feared she may not be safe if she had an ongoing medical issue. She then agreed to go with the paramedics to the hospital for a medical evaluation.In the mean time operations had communicated a plan to accommodate our passengers to first officer. He briefed me and we coordinated deplaning the passengers with station operations. I spoke with a flight attendant supervisor; a hub coordinator; and our dispatcher over the phone. We then went to speak with the passengers who assisted flight attendant.We met the passengers [at their seats]; thanked them for their help; and asked them to tell us what happened.Although she spoke broken English; the conversation with the [first] passenger was conducted mostly in Spanish with first officer. I understood some of what the passenger said and asked first officer to translate the rest. During that conversation the passenger stated that flight attendant showed signs of discomfort before the flight both through her facial expressions and body language. During the flight the passenger saw flight attendant in the galley with a bag of ice on her head and she was crying. When the passenger offered to help; flight attendant stated she was dying. The passenger noticed she was weak and became very scared for flight attendant's life. The [first] passenger instructed the [second] passenger to contact the pilots.The flight attendant suffered a serious medical condition.,,,,When the Flight Attendant aboard an EMB-145 fell ill and incommunicado two passengers rose to the occasion managing to alert and contact the flight crew who diverted to a nearby airport where the flight attendant was met by EMT personnel and taken to the hospital for treatment.,"An EMB-145 flight attendant experienced a serious medical condition during the flight, exhibiting symptoms such as a severe headache and weakness. Passengers noticed her distress and informed the flight crew, leading the captain to declare an emergency and divert to a nearby airport.

Flight Crew reported to Maintenance a squeal in the cabin during Deadhead to ZZZ1. Line Maintenance arrived to investigate and requested Flight Crew to start engines with [Main Cabin] door shut. After listening in the cabin at normal pressure levels on the ground; Maintenance put aircraft pressurization system into manual mode and descended the cabin until reaching 3.0 psi and back to unpressurized; approximately 15 minutes. Crew experienced uncomfortable ear pressure but no other medical concerns. Maintenance tightened a connection in Pack-1 and Aircraft returned to service. In ZZZ; the following morning; Captain obtained a copy of the Maintenance procedures including the BOLD WARNING about non-essential personnel not being onboard. This pressurization took the flight crew to a cabin altitude below sea level; there is concern similar to a scuba dive. Pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable. Company Medical was called; but by this time it was 24 hours past the pressurization event. The flight attendant; who has a hearing impairment and wears hearing aids; reported being more plugged up than usual and was removed at Company Medical Doctor's request. The Flight Crew unaware pressurization to 3.0 psi was planned. Line Maintenance did not have copy of procedure with them. Flight Crew unaware of potential hazard due to no briefing from Maintenance personnel and no written copy of maintenance procedure. Ensure that when procedures are communicated from Maintenance Control to Line Maintenance; that warnings are transmitted. Provide written guidance on Flight Crew assisting Maintenance or provide adequate personnel to perform procedure without ANY assistance from Flight Crew.,Reporter stated the air conditioning packs on the EMB-145 are located in the wing root area under the cabin seats. The cabin pressure controller knob is extremely sensitive and controlling a rate of descent of 500 feet per minute is very difficult in the manual mode. The EICAS display indicated the cabin pressure had gone down to 1;500 feet during the ground pressurization leak check. What the actual pressure ended up being; he is not sure; but flying at altitude after that may not have been advisable as he learned later.,Crew was Deadheading in the cabin on an EMB-145 aircraft to ZZZ1 and heard a squeal sound when pilots added power. Upon landing captain informed Maintenance Control. Control contacted ZZZ1 contract mechanic to investigate a squeal sound in the aircraft cabin. Maintenance Control directed crew to start engines while contract mechanic and Maintenance Control investigated the squeal. Contract mechanic was on the phone with Maintenance Control. The mechanics believed the issue was a loose connection in the PACK systems. However; without the flight crew knowing; Maintenance Control directed contract mechanic to conduct an 'air check.'Crew was unaware of this procedure and not briefed prior. Contract mechanic did not have a checklist. Flight Attendant was onboard. Contract mechanic; under the direction of Maintenance Control; and without warning to the crew onboard; pressurized the cabin substantially below sea level using the manual mode pressurization system to achieve a 3.0 psi pressure differential. Crew and contract mechanic experienced uncomfortable ear pressures during the procedure and the procedure was stopped within 15 minutes. Contract mechanic tightened the PACK connections and under the direction of Maintenance Control the contract mechanic signed off his work. Crew did not report any medical conditions preventing the safe operation of the aircraft. Flight operated safely back to base; conducting flight back to ZZZ. This report is being submitted for the operation of two flights; ZZZ-ZZZ1-ZZZ; because the crew were on board an aircraft which was pressurized below sea level prior to these flights. The concern arises from the possibility that pressurizing the aircraft to a pressure below sea level may expose flight crews to injuries similar to those of scuba divers. Captain contacted Maintenance Controller X who stated that this procedure was not dangerous. Captain obtained the 'leak check' procedure from ZZZ Company Maintenance department and found the procedure was not what the crew witnessed. The crew did not have prior knowledge of the Medical Warning found on page one of the procedure. Captain contacted ZZZ Chief Pilot who did not know how to proceed but directed the captain to Company Medical. Captain called Company Medical whose Doctor concluded that further flights would be safe because 12-hours had elapsed from the exposure. However; Flight Attendant; who wears hearing aids was removed by Company Medical Doctor to evaluate ear conditions prior flying again.Crew was not briefed that Maintenance Control had directed contract mechanic to conduct a 'leak check.' Contract mechanic under the authority of Maintenance Control conducted the check without a visual checklist. This is not the first report captain has submitted highlighting the prevalence of Maintenance Control talking contract mechanics through a procedure via telephone. This practice is potentially dangerous especially if the WARNINGS in the procedures are not communicated to those persons inside an aircraft during these procedures. Company should issue written standards to the flight department outlining the approved procedures which would allow pilots and crew to assist contract mechanics with the servicing and maintaining of the aircraft fleet. These verbal procedures are potentially hazardous especially to flight crew because flight crew often operate in extreme environments and with limited time on the ground to acclimate or recover from exposures. Because the FAA relies largely on the science of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) for infection control procedures; then FAA should likely consult hyperbaric medical societies for procedures involving aircraft pressurization and the standards for medical screening of crew and passengers involved in these procedures and involved in inflight rapid depressurization events.,,A Contract Mechanic was directed by Maintenance Control to pressurize the cabin of an EMB-145 aircraft to below sea level in the manual mode. Flight crew and Flight Attendant were not made aware after being requested to start engines with the main cabin door closed. Uncomfortable ear pressure was experienced. Crew departed in the morning; but pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable due to scuba dive effect.,"The incident involved an EMB-145 aircraft operated by a flight crew from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and back. During the deadhead trip, the crew heard a squeal in the cabin and reported it to maintenance. Maintenance requested the crew to start engines with the cabin door closed and proceeded to manually pressurize the cabin to 3.0 psi without informing the crew. This resulted in uncomfortable ear pressure for the crew and the flight attendant, who has a hearing impairment, leading to her removal by a doctor. The root cause was the maintenance team's failure to brief the crew, lack of a checklist, and reliance on verbal procedures. The captain later discovered that the procedure followed wasn't the standard one, and this wasn't the first such incident, highlighting potential dangers of verbal communication in extreme environments. The proposed solutions include establishing written company procedures for maintenance and crew assistance, and consulting medical experts for safer pressurization standards. The outcome emphasized the need for clear communication and standardized procedures to prevent future incidents.",between attendant and passengers

I asked Mr. X to buckle his seatbelt and that is when his wife; Mrs. X; seated in XXE; advised me that Mr. X suffered from dementia. I proceeded to assist Mr. X and buckled his seatbelt around him. While completing our safety checks for landing; I noticed that Mr. X did not have his seatbelt fastened. I again asked Mr. X to buckle up for landing. He was not complying; so I assisted Mr. X by buckling his seatbelt for him. I proceeded to my jumpseat and buckled in. While seated I had heard the noises of a seatbelt being unbuckled. I turned around and looked up the aisle toward the forward part of the aircraft and noticed that Mr. X had his seatbelt unbuckled and hanging in the aisle. I proceeded to get up and inform Mr. X that his seatbelt need to be fastened for landing. He made some unrecognizable noises and words and proceeded to stand up and enter the aisle of the aircraft. I advised Mr. X that he needed to seated for landing. There was a lady passenger seated in front of him in XYD that had an infant attached to her in a Baby Bjorn type of harness. Mr. X proceeded to attempt to grab the child by placing his hands under each of the infants' arms. The pax in XYD was in complete shock. I tried to get Mr. X to release the child. Once I did so; Mr. X continued to stay in the aisle of the aircraft when I heard the landing gear deploy. Once again; I asked Mr. X to take his seat for landing and he continued to stand in the aisle. The following happened in order: Mr. X refused to listen to our orders to sit down in his seat for landing.Mr. X became slightly combative with the female passenger seated in XXC who was trying to help. Mr. X grabbed her right wrist tightly causing discomfort and pain. Once FA in the back and I realized how close we were to the ground due to fog; we had to stay standing in the aisle to protect Mr. X. I proceeded to try and get around Mr. X to make sure I was standing in front of him to protect him from lurching forward once we touched down on the runway. FA stayed [in] the back to make sure Mr. X did not fall backwards. While going around Mr. X; he pushed his backside against me and pushed me into the passenger seated at XYC. He then yelled at me telling me I was an '[expletive]' I repeatedly told Mr. X that 'I am here for your safety!! I am here for your safety!!'FA notified the Purser of the situation once we had landed. Purser then relayed the information to the flight deck crew. Mr. X continued to walk around the back cabin and aft galley as we taxied in and FA blocked the doors preventing Mr. X from trying to open the doors while they were armed. I stood between Mr. X and the infant child seated in XYD since the mother was frightened by the earlier actions. FA and I remained with him and in the aisle until the aircraft came to a complete stop and blocked in at the gate.,,,,An Air Carrier Flight Attendant had to deal with a non-compliant passenger who suffered from dementia. He refused to obey commands to fasten his seatbelt and on final approach; stood up in the cabin and alarmed other passengers with his odd behavior. The flight attendants kept the unruly passenger from the armed exit doors until blocked in at the gate.,"The incident occurred on an Air Carrier flight during which a Flight Attendant (FA) encountered a non-compliant passenger, Mr. X, who suffered from dementia. The cause of the incident was Mr. X's refusal to fasten his seatbelt during both takeoff and landing, despite the FA's assistance in securing it. During the final approach, Mr. X unbuckled his seatbelt, stood in the aisle, and displayed erratic behavior, including attempting to grab an infant from a nearby passenger, which alarmed other passengers. The process of the incident involved the FA repeatedly attempting to assist Mr. X in complying with safety protocols. However, Mr. X became combative, grabbing a female passenger's wrist and yelling at the FA. As the aircraft approached the runway, the FA and another FA stationed in the back worked to protect Mr. X from potential injury during landing by positioning themselves strategically. Once the aircraft landed and taxied to the gate, the FAs ensured Mr. X remained in the cabin and prevented him from accessing the exit doors while they were armed. The FAs remained with Mr. X until the aircraft was secured at the gate. The result of the incident was the successful containment of Mr. X and the protection of other passengers and crew until the situation was resolved safely. No physical harm was reported, and the FAs effectively managed the situation.",between attendant and passengers

Whenever any passenger requested any sort of assistance from medical to a snack we were providing it to them. Flight attendants were making attempt to inform our base supervisor and crew services of the situations taking place on the aircraft. XA:30Pilot informed Lead Flight Attendant (LFA) of diversion to a nearby airport. The landing was going to take place rather fast. At this time LFA informed the other flight attendants of the diversion. Pilot In Command (PIC) made the PA announcement that the flight will be landing in ZZZ due to unable to land at our filed destination due to weather. LFA followed up with a PA announcement indicating the diversion. Also; stated for flight attendants to begin preparing the cabin for arrival. XA:454 chimes - Flight attendants picked up remaining service items and LFA did final compliance walk for landing. XB:02 (Actual)LFA made the arrival announcement.XB:05Aircraft was parked on Tarmac. LFA began Tarmac record. LFA pulled up Tarmac Delay information in [the Ipad]. Passengers begin standing in the aisle stretching legs and standing in line for the 3 lavatories on board. XB:25 [A] Passenger's wife came forward to the galley and stated husband is feeling very nauseous. FA 3 provided his wife with ginger ale; water; trash bag and offered a snack. At this time she refused a snack for him. Then [FA 3] followed passengers to seat to assess.XB:32LFA advised PIC we were in need of our official block out time for delay record. Instead of the block out time PIC informed lead we do not have this time since we are sitting on an active Tarmac. Instead noted and gave the arrival time into the divert airport. XB:42 PIC made announcement we were expecting to depart ZZZ and head to ZZZ1 in about an 1 hour and fifteen minutes. This would give the crew an ETA into our original destination of XC:57. With this ETA given lead then discussed with Flight Deck (FD) the potential for a pour service to be needed. Flight attendants were advised against a pour and snack service to be conducted. XC:00Passengers came forward and stated she was a diabetic and insulin was under the plane. She said she was due for it in about an hour. If we could give her some M&M's and water she would be fine until the delay is completed. Even though this was a medical related issue we did not have to ask for a doctor. Flight deck was notified by LFA. From XB:02 till XC:00 all doors on the aircraft were armed during the tarmac delay! XC:06 The flight deck made an announcement that the aircraft would be taxing to a different fueling area. LFA made prior to aircraft movement announcement minus electronic devices to ensure compliance before saying it was safe to move aircraft. LFA walked the cabin to ensure compliance. FA 2 and 4 were seated in jump seat with aft barrier strap up. FA 2 stated aft cabin secure. A single chime [to] flight deck to signal cabin was ready for movement. Flight deck then called and asked if we were ready for movement. LFA stated to captain 'this is why I single chimed you'.XC:20 Aircraft arrived at fueling area. Captain asked if doors were armed if so they needed to be disarmed because we were about to fuel. LFA made the announcement FA prepare doors for arrival.XC:23 [FA 3] who injured himself earlier on the deicing fluid in the cabin while stowing his baggage before departure FA 2 saw him limping. FA 2 called forward to ask if there was [a] bandage in the First aid kit. LFA looked at the items in our First Aid kit and we did not have [a] bandage. FA 2 came forward to get ice for the customer. XC:27[Another] passenger who had Claustrophobia came forward to the bulk head just looking for space away from other passengers and crew members. Crew members remembered this passenger from the previous week flight. Atthis point we noticed [passenger] very hot; sweaty and in a panic. She was saying can I just get air! She then began vomiting in the trash bag in the galley. LFA made the announcement of do we have any doctors or nurses on board and if so can you ring your FA call button. At this time LFA also notified the flight deck of the situation and we were filling out a cabin report. While the nurse who was chosen by [flight crew] as our medical personnel from mid cabin to come forward. LFA stayed with the passenger ensuring her everything was going to be ok and we were working with the FD for passengers to get off the aircraft.XC:29 PIC headed to aft of the aircraft to do a walk around. PIC asked flight attendants 2 and 4 to hold and watch the tail cone door exit. At this time he went down the steps the FA had deemed to be 'hazardous'.XC:31First Officer (FO) called [FA] into the FD after the cabin report had been given to them. With the cabin report [medical services] was contacted. Once [medical services] was contacted FO gave [FA] his personal cell phone to have the conversation with [medical services]. [Medical services] advised the passenger to begin doing breathing exercises. [Medical services] wanted the use of [oxygen]. [A FA] got the [oxygen] uncovered the mask and the customer felt like it would make her become more claustrophobic. On the cabin report the only medication the passenger stated she had taken was Gravol. At the time I did not know what Gravol was. Passenger said it was motion sickness medicine. When I was writing this report I researched what this drug is. According to [website] Gravol is a new synthetic drug. It is highly addictive and makes users dangerously paranoid; to the point of suicide. It also causes paranoia; kidney failure; hallucination. During the conversation with [medical services] I initiated a crew to crew call with [medical services]. During this short called I asked her to come forward and help with the passenger. [Medical services] at this time stated that the only medicine in our Medical kit which could be administered to the passengers was Benadryl. Passengers refused the Benadryl as well and stated the Gravol should work. Passenger asked if she could sit in a seat in the bulkhead. One of the passengers in [bulkhead seat] heard this comment be made and was willing to move to [passengers] seat. [passenger] thanked the guy in [bulkhead] for doing this for us. [Passenger] calmed down once this decision was made. XC:40 FA 4 stated beverage and snack service as requested was needed for the cabin. Lead had lost track of time during the medicals and everything else; which was taking place in the cabin. Lead notified FD pour service was beginning. XC:41 FA immediately began pour service. We used the plastic bins inside the carts lined them up with cups and started pouring water into them. During this pour service we ran out of water on the carts and crew water. The only water we had left was the water bottles the crew had already drank out of. This service was completed by the 120 minute mark of the delay. XD:19Lead notified Captain we were right at the 3 hour mark of the delay. Passengers even after the service began getting upset. LFA notified flight deck the passengers were beginning to get upset. During the Tarmac delay instead of using the Interphone system to communicate with lead. The flight deck was just opening the door to have communication. LFA ask flight deck if we can go to normal procedures to open the door due how the passengers were being. At this time LFA notified captain that we are getting close to that 3 hour mark of the delay. Asked captain to make another announcement. XD:21Captain advised lead we were about to taxi to gate. FA prepare doors for departure announcement was made. Aircraft was prepared for taxi to the gate. FA did compliance check.XD:27 Announcement was made to prepare doors for arrival. Captain notified FA that the aft stairs would be used for deplaning. FA 2 notified lead the aft stairs were not safe to deplane off of due to the slick liquid (De icing liquid) on the stairs. LFA notified Crew services we did not feel it was safe. They advised us that passengers should take all belongings because there was a chance the plane was going to get Remain Overnight (RON) for the night in the divert airport.XE:30 Captain advised to deplane from the aft stairs even though FA advised against it. As soon as this announcement was made passengers began deplaning prior to LFA finishing her conversation with her supervisor. Once off the phone LFA advised passengers to take all carry on luggage with them down the back stairs of the aircraft and use caution exiting. During the deplaning process [ill passenger's] bag was taken in. LFA asked FD if she could exit aircraft to retrieve her bag. They told LFA to have her contact our supervisor. During the time frame of XE:50 and XG:45[Ill passengers] exited the aircraft not long after the passengers did to deplane. When [medical services] got back onto the plane they stated the passengers are in the terminal area and no one is giving them any updates. They just wanted the pilots or some airline employee to give some updates! XG:45 Began boarding again up the tail cone stairs; which was contaminated with both snow and the deicing fluid. FD asked LFA if we were ok with doing this. After discussion with the crew we decided since they already deplaned off these stairs. It's not safe but [might] as well board and get to our filed destination! Now while boarding the water from snow melting in combination with the deicing fluid made more of the aisle way slick. Just like it was in the departure airport. The flight attendants tried to [mitigate] any risk while boarding and LFA made boarding announcements like normal. While boarding a gentleman near the front of the aircraft stated his name was not on the manifest the gate agent was using. LFA notified flight deck. LFA told the flight deck this could be seen as a security issue. PIC stated a gate agent must tell the flight deck no security issues prior to pushing back. After it appeared boarding was complete FA 2 completed a count when I read the verification announcement. FA's noted we were missing 8 people. This was verified by the gate agent giving FA 2 the names of the individuals to read on the PA. The FA 2 told passengers to ring their FA call buttons if they were on board. FA 4 and 3 re briefed exit rows. PIC handed the paper work through the window of the aircraft to a gate agent. LFA stated 'Cabin Secure!; Clear to Close?' I single chimed FD indicating we were ready for push back. FA 3 asked lead if she was ok with doing the safety demo and she would read the safety demo. I said yes and I did the safety demo in the cabin. After the safety demo I walked down the aisle to ensure compliance again. Once I got back informed passengers we would be dimming the cabin lights for departure and read the deicing announcement. XH:15Finally; we landed in our originally filed destination. Arrival announcement was made and we apologized for the delay. Also; stated use caution when exiting the aircraft and getting carry on luggage out of the over head bins. LFA made the FA prepare doors for arrival announcement was made. LFA did her cabin sweep of any left items and cross checked all doors were not armed.XH:58 Crew called crew services to find out information about ride to hotel; what hotel we are staying in and what our show time is for the next day. Finally got the [hotel] our crew was dead tired. We all just wanted to check in and put our heads on a pillow. The day had used every ounce of energy we had. Once I walked up stairs to my room the hall way smelled as if smoking had been taking place. It didn't smell like cigarettes to me. Being in aviation I wasn't ok with the smell I was smelling just in case I was to get drug tested. I exited the room o,,,,A MD-80 Flight Attendant described crew and passenger behavior following a weather related diversion. After a three hour ground delay with passenger illnesses and unrest the flight taxied to the gate. Later; the flight re-boarded for its original destination.,"The incident involved a weather-related diversion of an MD-80 flight, causing a three-hour ground delay. During the delay, flight attendants managed medical situations, including a passenger experiencing nausea and a claustrophobic episode, while also addressing passenger unrest. Despite challenges with cabin service and communication, the crew eventually re-boarded the aircraft and proceeded to the original destination, ensuring a safe arrival. The flight attendants coordinated with ground staff for hotel arrangements, concluding a taxing day with fatigue.",between attendant and passengers

I stood up and knocked on the door and told the passenger to take her seat we were landing. She said she had to pee and she could 'do what ever she wanted.' I knocked again on the door and asked her if she was smoking in there because I could smell smoke and the smoke alarm was going off so she needed to get out right now! She said that I could not tell her what to do! The cockpit called back to inform us they had a light that said smoke in the lav and we informed him that we had a passenger that refused to go back to her seat. The landing gear was coming down and at this point I told her she better stay in there (if she came out she couldn't get to her seat without endangering the passenger in XXC) The Captain made a PA for the passenger in the lav to return to her seat immediately! She came out; cussing up a storm; and had sprayed something in the lav that she claimed was feminine hygiene spray. I repeated 'were you smoking in there?' She started waving her arms and saying 'she could do whatever the [explitive] she wanted and no one could [explitive] tell her what to do' over and over.Another Flight Attendant got her to sit down with the assistance of the passenger in XXC. I talked to the cockpit and informed them that she was now seated and her seat number. The Captain asked me to check the lav to make sure nothing was on fire and I did. She had sprayed something in there to hide the smell of smoke and it was overpowering! No cigs were found in trash can so I took my seat. There was no reason for her to spray that spray and be so defiant if she wasn't guilty! I smell cigarettes and the smoke alarm was going off. I did not smell her spray until she opened the door! She was 2 steps away from the lav the entire flight and she chose to go to the bathroom after we were seated! Police met the flight and questioned her and never came in to check the lav. This woman interfered with the duties of the flight crew; caused alarms to go off in the cockpit during sterile cockpit; told us we couldn't tell her what the [explitive] to do; and almost caused us to land standing up. She should not be allowed to fly again if she can't follow instructions and is going to carry on the way she did! Unfortunately; I believe the police let her go. They asked us if she did finally sit down; which she did...but that was not the problem; the problem was that she was smoking in lav! That is against FAA regulations; if was not just her not complying with crew member instructions...Unbelievable!,,,,An unruly passenger entered a lavatory on approach; apparently lit a cigarette and eventually set off the smoke alarm. The reporter/Flight Attendant's attempts to extricate the passenger were unsuccessful until the Captain made an announcement demanding she return to her seat. She then left the lav; which reeked with what she claimed was a feminine hygiene product; and excoriated the reporter in vulgar terms. The passenger was detained by airport police.,"The incident occurred during the approach to landing when a passenger entered the lavatory, lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke alarm and message panel. The Flight Attendant requested the passenger return to her seat, but she refused. The Captain addressed the passenger via a public announcement, prompting her to exit the lavatory, where she cursed and claimed to have used feminine hygiene spray. The Flight Attendant discovered the spray but no cigarettes, suggesting the passenger's defiance indicated guilt. The smoke alarm disrupted cockpit communication during a critical phase. The passenger was detained by police but not arrested. The Flight Attendant believes FAA regulations should be enforced against her for smoking in the lavatory and non-compliance.",between attendant and passengers

Nothing was ever said to me about Air Marshals on the flight. This flight had FAA Inspector on board; who works in the Certificate Management Office. The problem began when the agent started the boarding process without consulting with the flight attendants. Passengers arrived at the airplane; catching the flight attendants off guard. The FAA Inspector actually held the passengers on the jet bridge while the flight attendants scrambled to prepare the airplane. FAA Inspector apparently confronted the ticket agent and; according to the Inspector; the ticket agent copped an attitude. A few minutes later an armed FBI agent appeared at the cockpit door to show me his ID. I had no paper work on the individual and he said the ticket agent had my copy of the paper work. A few minutes later a DEA agent arrived at the airplane; and this time the ticket agent had sent my paper work with the DEA agent. I asked the DEA agent if he was aware of the Air Marshals and the FBI agent that were also on the flight; and he said he knew about the FBI agent; but not the Air Marshals. I immediately called for a supervisor to come to the plane. I explained the situation to the supervisor and he apologized for the mix up and said he would take care of the issue. A few minutes later another ticket agent came into the cockpit and I asked if the LEOs had met the Air Marshals. He said there were no Air Marshals on board. Then the original ticket agent came to the cockpit and I asked him if there were any Air Marshals on board. He said 'no'. One of the ticket agents went back to the gate counter and returned to the airplane a few minutes later and told me there were indeed two Air Marshals on board. Knowing that the two LEO's did not know of the Air Marshals; I instructed the ticket agent to inform all four armed individuals of each other. (Which he did). The flight departed 13 minutes late with no further issues. FAA Inspector said he would be investigating the events on this flight which has prompted me to submit this report.,,,,Armed Federal Agents and Law Enforcement Officers boarded aircraft without proper notification to the crew and or knowledge of each others presence.,"An incident occurred when multiple armed federal agents boarded a flight without prior notification to the crew, resulting in confusion and a delayed departure. The agents included an FAA Inspector, FBI agent, DEA agent, and two Air Marshals. The boarding process began without consulting the flight attendants, who were unprepared, causing a delay as passengers were held on the jet bridge. Communication issues led to the flight attendant being unaware of all law enforcement personnel initially. After an FBI agent and DEA agent arrived, the flight attendant sought a supervisor, who apologized and resolved the confusion by informing all agents of each other's presence. The flight departed 13 minutes late, with the FAA Inspector initiating an investigation.",between attendant and passengers

After the Lead Flight Attendant made his announcements; I thought I heard him say 'prepare doors.' I did so and began walking up the aisle checking on passengers. At this time; I realized that the front entry door and cockpit doors remained open. I proceeded to walk forward to inquire. When I arrived to the forward galley; a caterer came from the rear of the aircraft and informed us that he had popped the slide. We inquired if he was injured; and he said no. I followed him to the aft galley as he told me that he had seen the orange strap; but that his sunglasses had been giving off a glare and he had opened the door anyway. The slide had been fully deployed and was facing upward at an angle as the door was only partially opened. The gate agent; the caterer; and I placed the slide inside the aft galley so the plane could be taken to another gate and a new plane brought to our current gate. We immediately contacted the Captain and began to secure another aircraft; deplane passengers; and continue our flight. The entire procedure was done effectively and efficiently and we departed less than 50 minutes late and all connections were good.I am eternally thankful that no one was injured due to my misunderstanding and know in the future I will be on high alert and double check myself. In this job; there are so many things going on at once in an attempt to board passengers; stow their bags; do our duties and depart on time. Sometimes; I get caught up in repetitive routines like simply shutting the doors and preparing for the demo that I have neglected a very important aspect. I should have immediately returned to the aft galley and 'unprepared' my doors as soon as I saw the forward entry door was open. As for the caterer; thankfully he was not injured; however; I would hope in the future he will never attempt to open a door with the strap across the window.,,,,An emergency exit slide was deployed at the gate by a caterer when a Flight Attendant incorrectly understood the order to arm the doors had been given.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant misunderstood an order to arm the doors, leading to an emergency exit slide being deployed at the gate by a caterer. The Flight Attendant believed they had heard the Lead Flight Attendant instruct to ""prepare doors"" and proceeded to check the cabin. Upon reaching the forward galley, they discovered the front entry door and cockpit doors were open. A caterer approached and explained that they had intentionally opened the forward entry door, mistaking the orange safety strap for a signal to deploy the slide due to sunglass glare. The slide was fully deployed and facing upward, creating an obstruction. The Flight Attendant, along with the caterer and gate agent, secured the slide, moved the aircraft to another gate, and coordinated with ground staff to bring a replacement aircraft. Passengers were deplaned, and the flight resumed less than 50 minutes after the initial delay. No injuries were reported, and the situation was handled efficiently. The Flight Attendant acknowledged the importance of double-checking procedures and expressed gratitude for the positive outcome. The caterer was unharmed but was advised against such actions in the future.",between attendant and passengers

We were all in our jump seats and had been anticipating landing when I noticed that we appeared to be circling. We were still at considerable altitude; higher than normal for that phase of flight. Knowing we were in 'sterile cockpit' I just waited; thinking to myself there must be a lot of traffic this time of night because if there were any problems the Captain would let us know.Just then; the 'all-call' came over the PA. I answered and identified myself. The Captain answered and said; 'We have a problem with our flaps not deploying the usual way so we have to get them down another way that just takes some time. I guess you could call this a simple 'heads up' because I anticipate a completely normal landing and there is nothing to worry about.' I said; 'Okay; thank you;' and then confirmed my crew had heard our exchange.We landed without incident; although CFR was at the ready down the runway. Upon deplaning; some passengers were curious as to why it took so long to land. I stated it was just traffic. I did not feel there was any need to alarm these passengers in any way when all was okay. There was only one passenger who challenged me by stating that he saw the fire equipment and that the flaps were still completely down even at the gate; so it wasn't just traffic.After landing and debriefing with my crew I explained what I thought had occurred and confirmed with the two flight attendants at door 4 that they both had said 'yes' when I asked if they heard the information. Unfortunately; we did not identify which doors had heard the info. I think in an effort to proctor excellent communication with all crew members when a situation that involves all crew members needing to be informed; that a new procedure [be implemented] to acknowledge receipt of the information door by door. That way if the Purser does not hear confirmation from all exits; he/she knows to relay the information to anyone who did not pick up the interphone.Upon turning on my phone on the way to the parking lot I listened to a very concerned message from a Supervisor who knew of the situation and wanted to be certain that the crew was okay. I returned her call and assured her that there was nothing out of the ordinary on landing. The Captain did not advise us to brief the cabin; it was merely a 'heads up' for the Flight Attendants and we landed without incident.,,,,Incomplete dissemination of information regarding a flap extension problem; which delayed the landing of a B757-200; left some passengers concerned; and some Flight Attendants uninformed.,"The incident involved a flap deployment issue on a B757-200 flight, which led to a delayed landing. The captain informed the flight attendants of the problem via the public address system, describing it as a minor issue that would not affect the landing. The flight attendant relayed the information to her crew and ensured they were prepared for landing. However, the delay caused some passengers to notice fire equipment on the ground, leading to questions about the situation. One passenger raised concerns about the flaps not being down, suggesting the delay was not due to traffic. After landing, the flight attendant debriefed her crew and realized that not all crew members may have received the initial communication. To address this, she proposed implementing a new procedure requiring each crew member to acknowledge receipt of information door by door, ensuring everyone is informed in similar situations. The incident concluded safely with no further issues, and the captain and crew confirmed that the landing was uneventful.",between attendant and passengers

It was raining fairly hard as well; and water was blowing in the forward galley door. I was saying goodbye to the passengers. Toward the end of deplaning; a woman who looked to be in her twenties; turned right to exit the aircraft instead of following those people directly in front of her who had turned left and exited properly. I immediately caught her turning and began to say repeatedly; 'NO; NO; NO; NO!!! Ma'am please turn around and go the other way'. The passenger continued on and stepped out onto the provisioning truck; finally stopping; turning around; getting back on the aircraft; and exiting aircraft left. The passenger never said anything to me or any (company) personnel. I should have been in the galley. It is very difficult when at times there are 3 crew members; provisioning and agents all jockeying for the same galley space. Perhaps there is some sort of temporary boundary that could be placed between the galley area and aisle to help passengers avoid mistakes. Although; I'm sure this would be considered a safety hazard.,,,,While deplaning; a passenger turned right into a B737 galley and; with the Flight Attendant calling to her; out into a provisioning truck before realizing the error; turning around and exiting the main cabin door.,"The incident occurred during the deplaning process of a flight. A passenger in her twenties attempted to exit the aircraft by turning right near the forward bulkhead, deviating from the standard leftward exit path used by other passengers. The flight attendant noticed this and repeatedly instructed the passenger to turn around and exit the correct way. Despite the attendant's intervention, the passenger continued to the provisioning truck, realized her mistake, reboarded the aircraft, and exited through the proper left-side door. The passenger did not engage in communication with the flight attendant or any crew members. The flight attendant reflected on the challenges faced during deplaning, particularly the limited space and the presence of multiple individuals (crew, provisioners, and agents) in the galley area. She suggested the possibility of implementing a temporary boundary to prevent such incidents, though she acknowledged the potential safety concerns associated with this idea.",between attendant and passengers

After I determined what the problem was I went to the jet bridge to call Maintenance Control. At the same time there was a Flight Attendant using the other phone on the jet bridge. As I was talking the Flight Attendant paused her conversation to ask me if it was OK to board the aircraft. I replied; 'No; it is not OK to board; please hold boarding'. She then advised the gate agent 'the mechanic said no; it is not OK to board'.After I finished my conversation with Maintenance Control; I went back to the cockpit to inform the Captain. I also informed the flight crew and the flight attendants that I had to go down in the E&E compartment to do a 'BITE' test on the IRU; and for them to not let any one near this area. At that point I proceed to go to the E&E compartment through the floor entrance.Shortly after I entered the E&E compartment I heard a noise. I looked to my right and discovered that someone had fallen into the E&E compartment. I asked the passenger if he was OK and he confirmed that he was. At that point I called out for help.

I could see the Ramp Agent pushing the stairs to the aft door; so I made the announcement that we would be deplaning out both the forward and aft exits. Although the door chime had not been given; the Ramp Agent opened the aft door and gave me a thumbs up to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots never told us to hold passengers and I could see that the 'A' Flight Attendant had opened the main cabin door; so I let passengers start to deplane. I did not realize an engine was still running due to problems with the APU. I was having trouble getting my ears to pop and could not hear very well. The ramp agents never told me to keep passengers on board. Even after the passengers started getting off; the ramp agents continued to unload bags. I didn't fully realize what had happened until we were in the taxi on our way to the hotel and Flight Attendant 'A' brought it up. We all should have communicated better and the aft door should not have been opened by the ramp until the engines were shut down and it was safe for passengers to deplane.We need to stress the importance of the ramp [personnel] being aware of what is going on around them. The ramp [personnel] are the eyes and ears for flight attendants as we can't always see or hear what is happening outside the aircraft. Also making sure the cabin crew is more observant; not always counting on the ramp [personnel] to give them accurate info.,,Opened main cabin door and found #2 engine still running in cool down mode.

Upon arrival, the seatbelt signs were off, but the door chime was not received. The Ramp Agent opened the aft door, prompting the Flight Attendant to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots had shut down engine #1 but left engine #2 running, awaiting ground power unit connection. The flight attendant, unaware of the running engine, permitted deplaning. Another flight attendant noticed the engine still running and shut it down after passengers had started leaving. Passengers deplaned while engine #2 was running, posing a safety risk. Post-incident, all parties agreed on the need for enhanced communication and awareness. Improve communication and coordination among flight, ground, and cabin crew. Ground personnel should act as the eyes and ears for the flight crew. Cabin crew should enhance their observational skills and not solely rely on ground crew information. This incident highlights the importance of clear communication and situational awareness to prevent similar occurrences.",between attendant and passengers

Approx 5 min later First Officer received a call from the cabin that the passenger passed out in the Flight Attendant's arms and that they were searching for medical professional on board.  Before the First Officer was able to get any additional information the Flight Attendant that called hung up.  The First Officer briefed me on the current situation. I instructed him to prepare for a possible diversion.  I got the ops freq for him and we set the FMS for the diversion. I then took over ATC comm and instructed the First Officer to get more information from the Flight Attendants on the age/sex of passenger name or seat assignment etc in case we needed to make a medical phone patch call. While he was talking to the Flight Attendant I informed ATC of our situation and the possibility of diverting for an unknown medical situation with a passenger that has passed out in the cabin.  The First Officer got in touch with one of the Flight Attendant and received some basic information that the passenger was female; non English speaking; vomiting and abdominal pains with two RN's evaluating her. The Flight Attendant then hung up on the First Officer again.  The First Officer briefed me on the information he received and informed me that in his opinion that both Flight Attendants were in a panic. The First Officer and I discussed the situation and I instructed him that we were 45 min from landing in ZZZ2 or 10 min from ZZZ.  We both agreed we needed more info from the Flight Attendants and RN before beginning our diversion.  I received instruction from ATC to descend to FL320 and switch to another ATC controller.  I checked in with that ATC controller and advised him of the situation of a possible diversion to ZZZ after we received additional information from the cabin on the condition of the passenger. During my conversation with ATC I heard the First Officer inform the Flight Attendant that she needed to ask the RNs for more information on the condition of the passenger; needed a seat assignment at least; and to tell the RN's that we needed a decision whether to continue to ZZZ2 that will take 40 min or divert to ZZZ that will take 10 min. When the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant I informed him of our decent to FL 320 and switched to another center freq.  We again discussed the situation with the Flight Attendant and finished preparations for diversion to ZZZ.  First Officer got ATIS and we set up for landing on RWY 23 in ZZZ.  First Officer then received a call from the Flight Attendant with seat assignment of passenger and that the RN's agreed that it would be best to divert to ZZZ.  When I heard that on the Interphone I informed ATC of or need to divert to ZZZ for a medical emergency. ATC gave  us a left descending turn to direct ZZZ. I informed ATC that we wanted paramedics; ambulance to meet the Aircraft for a female passenger in her mid 30's with abdominal pains and vomiting. After the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant. I brief him of our ATC instructions; asked him to call the company and instruct them that we will be diverting to ZZZ for a medical emergency and to pass on the information to our dispatcher and that we will call him on the ground in ZZZ.  We then completed all checklist and when we contacted ZZZ Approach Control were given straight in to Rwy XX.  We landed 10 min after beginning our descent on Rwy XX and in the Gate; 2 min after landing.  Paramedics took the passenger off the plane and she was transported to a local hospital.  The First Officer suggested that he talk to the Flight Attendant's on the situation to evaluate whether we should continue the flight to ZZZ2 with them.  I agreed.  (First Officer is a certified paramedic) I contacted dispatch and gave him all the information I had and while I was on the phone with him I was handed thepassenger boarding stub with the passenger's name and passed it onto dispatch.  After I finished my call with Dispatch a Flight Attendant came up to the cockpit. I asked her if there was anything used as far as emergency equip the passenger. She informed me that just the stethoscope and blood pressure cuff out of the EEMK [Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit] were used and replaced into the kit.  The First Officer returned to the cockpit and informed me that he talked to both the Flight Attendants and they were more relaxed and he felt that they were capable to continue the flight to ZZZ2 and back to ZZZ.  A few min later Flight Attendant 1 brought up one of the Flight Attendant O2 bottles and informed me that they had to give the passenger O2 and that the bottle pressure was below 1500 psi. I was a little disgusted and informed her that it needed to be replaced or serviced before we can leave ZZZ. I told her that I needed to know all the equipment that was used for this passenger; and should have be told of this when I asked the first time. (Note at this time the paramedics had already removed the passenger and we had been on the ground for about 15 min.) I called Maintenance Control about the O2 bottle and later discussed swapping the O2 bottle with the other CRJ9 that was overnighting.  Contract Maintenance did show up at the aircraft and serviced the O2 bottle. After contract Maintenance had finished the servicing of the O2 bottle and took the maintenance logbook to sign off the writeup the first officer and I prepared the aircraft for departure.  The next two flights were uneventful.  After returning back to ZZZ for the overnight I was performing my shutdown checklist when the Flight Attendant presented me the inventory checklist for the EEMK [Emergency Medical Kit] and First Aid Kit.  I again was disgusted.  The EEMK showed that the all items were in the EEMK but she had checked that it was incomplete and serviceable. One of the First Aid Kits was used and the latex gloves were used and the kit was incomplete. I informed her that this inventory should have been completed before we left ZZZ for ZZZ2 and I should have been informed when I asked her if any emergency equipment was used of the O2 bottle and the latex gloves were used.  I then called Maintenance Control to defer the First Aid Kit and after discussing the EEMK with him he decided to defer both the EEMK and the First Aid Kit that were used.  I left the Aircraft at XA:30 local time.,,,,A CRJ diverted to a nearby airport in response to a passenger medical emergency.  The Captain expressed some concern about the professionalism of the Cabin Attendants' familiarity with the administrative aspects of the aircraft emergency equipment.,"The incident involved a CRJ aircraft diverting to a nearby airport due to a female passenger experiencing a medical emergency, including vomiting and abdominal pains. The flight crew received initial reports from the cabin about the passenger's condition, followed by a request for medical assistance. The cabin crew's communication was described as panicked, with incomplete information provided during initial contacts. The flight crew prepared for the diversion, informed air traffic control (ATC), and requested emergency services at the diversion airport. The aircraft landed at ZZZ, where paramedics transported the passenger to a hospital. Following the landing, the flight crew discovered that emergency oxygen equipment had been used and was not properly serviced. The Captain expressed concern over the cabin crew's handling of the situation and their communication regarding the use of emergency equipment. Maintenance was called to service the oxygen bottle and defer the First Aid Kit, which had been used during the incident. The flight crew also reviewed the inventory of the Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit (EEMK) and found discrepancies in its contents. The flight resumed to its final destination, with no further issues reported during the remainder of the journey. The incident highlighted concerns about the cabin crew's familiarity with administrative procedures related to emergency equipment usage and their communication during critical situations.",between attendant and passengers

Initially, the passenger appeared to understand the briefing as she answered correctly. However, the language barrier became evident later when the passenger struggled to communicate in response to the attendant's request for drink orders.

We cancelled the push and discovered the passenger had self-reported having the flu and being very ill. I made the decision to remove the Passenger and coordinated with customer service and Dispatch.   After landing; mid galley Flight Attendant reported that when she went to disarm door; she realized she had never re-armed the door after passenger removal. Flight Attendant filling out report. According to all (including mother and daughter of passenger who was removed); the passenger was visibly 'not well' by all accounts.  She never should have been allowed to board the airplane; particularly with all of the information available on influenza and public health risks. The distraction to the Flight Attendant caused by the return of the jetway and removal of the passenger caused a departure with door 2L unarmed. The increase in risk of not being able to get off the airplane in the event of an evacuation could have been avoided by a quick screening of the passengers boarding our airplanes.,,,,A Flight Attendant realized after arrival she had not armed a door because of distractions related to removing an ill passenger at departure time.,"An incident occurred during a flight involving a sick passenger with the flu. After receiving pushback clearance, the Ground Personnel were informed about the passenger's condition. The passenger was visibly unwell and reported having the flu, leading to the decision to remove them from the flight. This decision was coordinated with customer service and Dispatch. Upon landing, the Flight Attendant discovered that she had failed to re-arm door 2L due to distractions caused by the passenger removal process. This oversight posed a risk in the event of an evacuation. The incident highlighted the potential consequences of not adequately screening passengers for health risks, particularly concerning contagious illnesses like influenza. A quick passenger screening process was suggested to prevent similar incidents in the future.",between attendant and passengers

The flight attendant, operating on minimum crew, was unaware that door 2L was to be used for deplaning. She disarmed both doors 2L and 2R as per procedure and proceeded to open the first-class closet door. During this time, a passenger opened door 2L after an agent knocked. The cause of the incident was a communication gap regarding the use of door 2L. The process involved the flight attendant disarming the doors and opening the closet, followed by the passenger opening door 2L.

Spoke to the Purser about this because there had been no information for passenger on oxygen on our briefing sheet. Later a passenger service representative boarded; letting us know that; indeed; we would have a passenger on oxygen. Fortunately; the agent had seen the passenger in the boarding area and saw that the passenger would not be using a nasal cannula but a trachea cannula instead. Everything on the aircraft had been incorrectly set up for a nasal cannula.  The agent redid the hoses and explained how to change the tanks.  The passenger was with his family and a paramedic in the boarding area but the paramedic was not allowed to board per a TSA officer even though the Captain had allowed it.  So; five minutes before departure the passenger is hastily boarded; along with his wife and 2 daughters who are traveling with him. I am given no additional/further medical information and am trying to communicate with people who speak limited English. One of the daughters questions me if the flight goes all the way to Vietnam. I tell her the flight number does but that everyone needs to deplane in VHHH. She becomes worried and says her father needs to stay on the oxygen and that they had been told that they wouldn't have to deplane. She makes a quick phone call and I speak to the Doctor. She is concerned about the VHHH stop because they had NOT been told about this. I assured them that they would have oxygen in VHHH and that everything was already taken care of because the computer booking would have alerted someone that this wasn't a nonstop flight. The doors were already closed at this time so I told the daughter that we would follow through and confirm with VHHH later on during the flight. I spoke with the Purser about this and we both felt it was important to follow up with VHHH because everything else related to our passenger had been very unorganized and mismanaged. Luckily; we had a Flight Attendant that spoke Vietnamese.  I asked her to speak to the family after takeoff and reassure them that the oxygen would have already been prearranged in VHHH.  Later; when the Vietnamese literate Flight Attendant was on her break; our passenger needed to use the bathroom.  I tried to communicate with the family to see how long he could be without oxygen and I couldn't really get a straight answer because of the language barrier. I erred on the side of caution and we strapped a portable oxygen bottle around the daughter who was assisting her father to the bathroom. The Purser had communicated to the cockpit the need for verification that we would have oxygen for the passenger in VHHH. Eventually; the cockpit received a message that the passenger had been advised in their PNR that there would be no oxygen in VHHH!!!!! And if they need it; it would be $250 USD. The Vietnamese speaker spoke to the family and they became a bit upset because here we are getting close to landing and we are making last minute arrangements for oxygen. Upon landing someone comes down the aisle with an aisle wheel chair and no oxygen. I had to forcefully let them know our passenger could not be moved without oxygen. The Purser; myself and a few of the economy flight attendants stayed on board for 40 minutes with the passenger and his family while company customer service representatives explained to the family that the price of the oxygen would be around $500 USD!!!!! This was due to the cost of a Doctor or Nurse needing to be there and there was a minimum charge for a set number of hours. The family became very distressed. The father was on his deathbed and this was his last flight so he could die in Vietnam and they had been given wrong information. It was devastating for us to see how poorly this family had been treated by our Company. More importantly; it was dangerous that someone didn't follow throughproperly. This family was basically shoved on the airplane without proper medical information ever being gathered and placed in his computer record and communicated to the crew.  Subsequently; the paramedic should have been allowed to board.  By to let the paramedic board; important medical information was not able to be conveyed to the crew due to the language barrier.,,,,A Purser relates her concerns about the services provided a passenger traveling with special medical needs.,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",between attendant and passengers

I continued to perform my duties to the best of my abilities during boarding and takeoff. After the boarding door was closed I was asked by the flight crew if I was alright. I told them I didn't know but I thought I would be okay & able to perform my duties. After the safety demo was done; I went to the lavatory where I dealt with vomiting & diarrhea. I was experiencing unbearable stomach cramps also. I had to go to the lav at least every 5 or so minutes. I got a call from the captain and was asked how I was doing. I told him I wasn't doing well at all and wouldn't be able to do an inflight service. I was asked if we needed to make an emergency landing. I told him I thought I could at least make it to our destination. After that phone call; I had to go back to the lav. At that point in time I was very weak & dizzy and couldn't make it back up to my jumpseat. So I retreated to the nearest seat. I left my jumpseat out the entire flight to create some sort of barrier between the cabin and the flight deck. A passenger came up to me and told me he was a former EMT & wanted to take my vital signs. He said I wasn't in the best shape but I would be okay. I asked him to call the flight deck and let them know what was going on with me. He then returned and told me we were about 30 minutes out from our destination and we would be landing soon. Once we landed; EMTs boarded the aircraft and assisted me into the terminal via wheelchair. My vital signs were taken and I told them the symptoms of how I was feeling. They told me it sounded like I had food poisoning and there wasn't much they or a hospital could do for me. They advised against going to the hospital. I was contacted by my manager and crew scheduling. I was told I was taken off my trip and my manager had me go to the airport clinic to be evaluated. The doctor at the clinic diagnosed me with food poisoning and told me not to fly anywhere that night or the next morning. He also said there was nothing he could prescribe me and that the illness would have to run its course. The next time I am ill to the point of not being able to perform my duties and I know well ahead of time I will definitely call crew scheduling and my manager and let them know immediately. I will also get to some sort of urgent care facility as quickly as possible. I should have called as soon as I started showing signs of illness. I understand also that it is a major problem with me being the only flight attendant on duty and not being able to be in the proper state of mind and body to effectively perform my duties.,,Flight Attendant got progressively sicker during flight to the point of a passenger needing to help fill in for her duties. I briefed the First Officer on the situation and he had heard some of it. I said we needed to find in the FOM/POM reference to flight attendant incapacitation. I could find no reference in POM index for flight attendant or incapacitation. First Officer eventually found it.I told her if she was not feeling well or felt worse to brief a passenger on the use of the interphone and have them contact the flight deck. ... with approximately 50 minutes left in the flight at FL340 I received an interphone call from the cabin from a passenger on board saying the flight attendant was ill. He identified himself as a pilot and EMT. I asked the status of our Flight Attendant and he said she was conscious with a good pulse and good breathing and aside from being sick to the stomach had good vitals.I briefed the passenger initially on the interphone use and if a chime was heard pick up the phone and if her condition changed to call us ... At some point I went in the back and briefed the EMT that if he believed the flight attendant could not adequate perform her duties to relocate the her to a passenger seat and that he needed to sit in the FA jumpseat per FOM 'Flight Attendant Incapacitation' procedures. He accepted and I briefed him on opening the door stowing the Flight Attendant jumpseat upon arrival at the gate and going over securing the cabin for arrival.,,A CRJ900 flight crew must make difficult decisions when the sole flight attendant aboard is incapacitated by food poisoning.,"A flight attendant on a CRJ900 aircraft became incapacitated due to food poisoning, which manifested with symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, and severe cramps. Despite initial attempts to continue her duties, her condition deteriorated, leading her to inform the captain she could not perform her responsibilities. The captain, referencing company procedures (FOM), coordinated with a passenger who was an EMT to monitor her condition and take appropriate actions. The flight landed safely, with the EMT assisting in securing the cabin and moving the flight attendant to a passenger seat. Upon deplaning, she was evaluated by EMTs and later at an airport clinic, diagnosed with food poisoning, and advised against flying. The incident highlighted the importance of early communication with crew scheduling and seeking timely medical assistance.",between attendant and passengers
