I feel like the company's policy regarding electronic devices containing lithium-ion batteries and spare lithium-ion batteries was not clear or fully understood by ask of the employees involved in this incident and the confusion contributed to the security breach. I also believe the agents were overzealous in enforcing the carry-on policy and the bag in question should have never been gate checked.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported a safety concern regarding the company's handling of gate checked bags that contain spare lithium-ion batteries and electronics with lithium-ion batteries.,"The incident arose from a security breach involving a gate-checked bag containing spare lithium-ion batteries. The flight attendant cited unclear company policies on lithium-ion batteries and excessive enforcement of carry-on policies by ground personnel as contributing factors. The flight attendant suggested that such bags should not be gate-checked, underscoring the importance of improved guidelines and staff training to prevent future breaches.",lithium batteries

Two passengers; the one I was talking to; and another let me know that they had laptops in their bags. I let the A-FA know what was going on so that he could help monitor what was going on; and the passengers went to the front of the plane to retrieve their laptops. I let the CA and Gate Agent know what was going on when I was able to make it to the front of the plane because the passengers had come back down the aisle and said the Ramp person; or someone; had told them the cargo hold was closed and they weren't going to get them. It's my understanding that all laptops and lithium batteries need to be taken out and are unable to go in that cargo area; so that is when I spoke with the Captain and Gate Agent. The Captain said we would wait. The passengers then came back again and said the CA said that it was ok to go due to the size and them being off. I checked with the CA one last time and he deemed it safe. I was not there for the conversation when they declared it safe; so I can only go with the CA telling me it is safe.If something was deemed safe by the CA then I go with that; but just everyone checking bags beforehand; Gate Agents and also ramp crew not saying no due to potentially just not wanting to get the bag. But if it's declared safe; it's declared safe.,,,,ERJ-170 Flight Attendant reported to the Captain and Gate Agent that two passenger bags with laptops that had lithium-ion batteries were mistakenly gate checked in cargo during boarding. The Captain then deemed it safe to not remove as the devices were off and approved gate departure.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) who identified two gate-checked bags containing laptops with lithium-ion batteries during boarding. The flight attendant informed the other flight attendant and the captain about the situation, as these items are prohibited in cargo holds due to safety regulations. Two passengers confirmed they had laptops in their bags, and they retrieved them after being instructed to do so. However, the passengers reported that ground personnel had initially prevented them from retrieving the laptops, stating the cargo hold was closed. The flight attendant communicated with the captain and gate agent, and the captain eventually deemed the situation safe, allowing the flight to depart. The issue was resolved after the captain's assessment, and the flight proceeded as scheduled.",lithium batteries

She approached me in the back and insisted there was space for her bag and that she wanted to bring it on board. I suggested she speak to the speak to the A-FA in the front and see if it was possible. Once she went back to the front and saw the ramp agent threw her bag down; she approached me again and began yelling at me demanding an explanation for the other flight attendants refusal. I explained that it's protocol for any tagged bag to be sent to cargo. She returned to her seat after our discussion. It wasn't until we were inflight and I was doing beverage service that I noticed she was filling out a complaint form to company. I saw her writing but I continued with my duties and asked if she wanted anything to drink or a snack. She looked at me; noted my name and requested water. After I finished service; I started to reorganize my galley for the next flight. However; I heard several overhead bins opening simultaneously which concerned me. I discovered that the passenger had opened them and was taking photos of all the empty bins. I needed to prioritize securing my galley so I focused on the safety in the back. Once I finished; I checked to see if the passenger was still standing in the aisle but she had returned to her seat. I called the A-FA to inform her about the passengers actions and we both agreed to notify the Captain. The A-FA also mentioned another issue involving a different passenger who had allegedly checked a bag containing lithium batteries and medication. I then updated the Captain about the upset passenger regarding her checked bag.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported a passenger misconduct and an unrelated issue of a passenger who allegedly checked a bag with lithium battery. The Captain was notified of both issues with no additional information provided.,"The incident occurred on a flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1, involving a passenger (Party2) and a flight attendant (Party1). The cause was the passenger's refusal to check her bag for an international trip, leading to a confrontation. The process began with the passenger insisting her bag fit in the overhead compartment, which the flight attendant redirected to the front attendant. When the passenger was denied, she became upset, yelled at the flight attendant, and filled out a complaint form during the flight. The result was the passenger opening multiple overhead bins and taking photos, prompting the flight attendant to secure the galley and notify the captain. The captain was informed about both this misconduct and a separate issue involving a passenger's bag with lithium batteries. The proposed solution involved notifying the captain to handle these issues through appropriate channels.",lithium batteries

The hover board was not there during checks.  On taxi out; during demonstration; the board was observed.  Cabin crew notified Captain.  FA's and Flight Crew checked manuals for acceptance.  In flight attendant manual; two sections were checked. Personal PED's and hazardous materials.  The first said not allowed.  The second said allowed with limitations.   Limitations had to do with the grams of lithium-ion batteries.  Could not find  reference to the acceptable grams.  Flight crew said their manuals said the amount in hover board was acceptable .Have a notification on boarding pass that says bulkhead so the agent can brief at gate and require a briefing by flight attendants  and notifying purser before aircraft door closure.   Aligning flight crew and FA manuals with same verbiage to avoid conflicting procedures.  In flight attendant manual; be more specific under hazardous materials about what constitutes a mobility device.,,Air Carrier Flight Attendant reported a communications breakdown with the Captain regarding whether Hoverboards are admissible as carryon baggage or check baggage.,"The incident involved a disagreement between a flight attendant (FA) and the flight crew regarding the admissibility of a passenger's hoverboard as carry-on or checked baggage. The passenger had a hoverboard in a box that was initially unnoticed during boarding but was observed during taxi-out. The FA reported this to the Captain, who permitted it if the lithium battery was under 50 grams, citing their manual. However, the FA referenced their manual, which prohibited PMDs (Personal Mobility Devices) as carry-on or checked baggage. The manual was found to have conflicting sections: one prohibiting PMDs and another allowing them with battery limitations, which were unclear regarding exact gram limits. The flight crew believed their manual permitted the hoverboard's battery. To resolve the issue, they proposed aligning FA and flight crew manuals to avoid confusion, adding boarding pass notifications for bulkhead passengers to brief at the gate, and enhancing the FA manual's specificity on PMD definitions under hazardous materials. The key cause was manual discrepancies, with proposed solutions to improve clarity and procedures.",lithium batteries

I could not find verbiage regarding this particular device. Understanding it was a mobility device. Where it concerns me is Ops was not able to verify the type of battery in the device.,,Female passenger preboarded the aircraft using an assistive device that appeared to be a hoverboard with a handle. The A Flight Attendant (FA) inquired about the type of battery powering the device and the passenger didn't give a conclusive answer. She responded that in ZZZ; the ground staff consistently checked the device as checked baggage and in ZZZ1; they allowed her to stow the device in the wheelchair compartment; which was what I desired to do for her. The A FA and I communicated this to the Operations Agent; who curtly replied that TSA allowed it through and that he had tagged it to be checked. He never communicated with us that he had confirmed the type of battery inside the device and he verified that it was safe for travel in the cargo hold of the aircraft. If he had indeed safely verified he had checked the device thoroughly; he should have been able to answer the question about the type of battery powering the device and communicated that information with both the flight deck crew and the Flight Attendants. It is my belief that a potential safety violation occurred here; and if not; then the Operations Agent needed to communicate the information to the crew in a manner that allowed us to be sure that the device in question was carried safely.

I directed the flight deck crew to don oxygen masks and set the regulators to 100 percent and established crew communication. I then [advised] ATC and asked for direct [destination]. Shortly thereafter; the Flight Attendants notified us that the device and its spare batteries (which were also in a state of thermal runaway) were contained in the ion battery emergency containment bag and there was no smoke.The device was apparently an e-cigarette. As the device was contained and there was no smoke; I elected to discontinue the QRH. However; the flight deck crew remained on oxygen for the duration of the approach and landing. Approach and landing were uneventful. My biggest concern is that after attempting to notify the Flight Attendants that we were on oxygen; I never called them back. They were making announcements on my first attempt and I simply dropped calling them back off my to-do list. They were surprised when we landed and were surrounded by Fire Rescue.Distraction management continues to be an issue for all flight crews. As a Check Airman; I should have done a better job of communicating. Better use of all my resources would have kept this from happening.
