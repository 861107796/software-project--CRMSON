The first class wasn't even deplaned. Only three people had deplaned while others were trying to get their bag down and deplane. I said no not at this point; which in turn the first cleaner gave me serious attitude. The Gate Agent came down; no mask on; with an attitude about us not letting the cleaners enter to clean. They had 12 people to clean; usually they have a shortage of cleaners. But we hadn't even had first class passengers cleared and they started coming on. I asked not yet; let the passengers deplane and this flight is a full flight. This is becoming a serious issue at times and passengers getting upset they can't deplane and usually the cleaners keep cleaning and not moving in so they can deplane. Understand at this time with COVID the importance of cleaning but passengers complain at me about cleaners not clearing so the could deplane. It's stressful enough with all we are dealing with no food drinks and upset passengers about what they can't have. Our passengers were moving quick and not stalling getting off.  When they were off we couldn't get our bags and personal items together.  The flight deck wasn't able to exit.

I conveyed what had happed to both FA A and the CA.  Shortly after 10;000 feet as I was heading forward to retrieve a set of headphones for another guest; as I walk by; I find her laying across XX1 and 2 with her head propped up on her book bag on the aisle arm rest; head hanging over into the aisle without a mask.  I tried rousing her quietly with no response from her and then gently tapped her on the shoulder and her exclaiming; 'What?!  What do you want?'  I politely asked her to please put her mask on and cover both her nose and mouth as required and to please ensure her seatbelt remained fastened while the seatbelt sign was on as we were still ascending.  She begrudgingly complied as she continued to complain and others around her asked her to wear it as well.  During service; once again; Passenger X had her mask below her chin as she sat with her foot propped up in the seat and was painting her toenails.  I politely asked her again to comply with the mask requirement and to please not polish her toenails as the fumes were offensive to those around her.  She denied painting her toenails (with polish in an opened [bottle and] nail polish remover pad in hand). I explained to her once again that wearing a mask is a requirement that she had been made aware of prior to boarding and that it wasn't fair to the other passengers and crew on board as everyone else was diligent in complying. I also made her aware that she had been informed several times.  As I started to walk forward to let FA A know what had transpired.  We called the CA and let him know that we were doing and to be prepared in the event that the situation escalated.  The guest in front of her Passenger Y asked if there was something more I could do or move her when suddenly her voice level became elevated and she said 'There!  I pulled the mask up and I have a headache so go away!' Subsequently we (FA A and myself) asked the Passenger Y if he would be more comfortable in another seat and he accepted.  Passenger Y and several other guests commended us for how we handled the situation.  Passenger Y gave his permission for this airline to contact him regarding the situation and events. Passenger X complied for the rest of the flight.  Upon final compliance before landing; Passenger X was asked by both FA A and myself to again stow her bags which she finally did by tossing and kicking them under the seat.  Upon landing she quickly stood; gathered her belongings and hurried off of the plane before rows in front of her stood.  Although we understand the importance of wanting to retain customer loyalty; this kind of behavior should not be tolerated for the sake of one over an entire cabin of guests and employees.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger did not comply with wearing a face mask during flight and exhibited other non-compliant behavior.,"A flight attendant encountered a passenger who repeatedly failed to comply with mask-wearing regulations and other cabin behavior guidelines. The passenger, identified as X, was reminded multiple times before takeoff to stow her belongings and wear her mask. During the flight, Passenger X disregarded these instructions, lying across seats and removing her mask. She also engaged in painting her toenails, despite being asked to stop due to fumes bothering others. When addressed, Passenger X became confrontational, raising her voice and refusing to comply. The flight attendant and crew, including the Chief Attendant, took steps to mitigate the situation, offering alternative seating to affected passengers. Passenger X eventually complied with mask requirements for the remainder of the flight but quickly left the aircraft upon landing. The flight attendant emphasized that such behavior should not be tolerated, prioritizing the comfort and safety of all passengers and crew.",disruptive

I went back and asked passenger if they were in the exit row or did they move and she said she moved because she wanted a window seat. I explained I needed her to move back to her original seat as we had not briefed her for the exit row. I told her I would come back and explain more about why after we got in the air.  She moved back. I went back to my FWD jumpseat and called the Captain to tell him we were secure and passenger was back in her seat. AFT FA made a PA telling passenger of need to keep masks on then told me that same passenger had removed hers.

I walked back and there was an open beer bottle can on her tray. I asked her what was in the bottle and asked if it was an X brand beer and alcohol. She said yes and I told her she could not have her alcohol on board.  She asked why but said OK; and I took it and showed the aft FA in the galley then threw it away and immediately called the flight deck. The FO apparently answered and I told him the same passenger that had tried to move in to the exit row and we had a mask issue with had an open beer on her tray that we took from.

The Gate Agent then retrieved a record confirming the exemption, allowing Passenger X to remove the mask for short periods. However, during the 2.5-hour flight, Passenger X repeatedly ignored the mask policy, often only covering his chin instead of his nose and mouth.

I let him know that it has been a policy that every person flying must wear their mask over their nose and mouth and that I didn't want to report him which would suspend his travel privileges with us. He looked at me very annoyed and said 'well if I hold my water bottle; I cannot wear my mask; right?' I let him know that our policy is to wear your mask when not actively eating or drinking. So if he isn't drinking; he needs to be wearing his mask. I let him know that if he has a medical condition; then he may need to fly with a different carrier for the time being and that if he had a return flight; he would need to comply. He then took his mask off; and started to actively drink his water slowly so he didn't have to wear it. We were about to land; and at that point it was too late to give him another warning.

The passenger, who had a return flight scheduled a week later, claimed a medical condition prevented him from wearing the mask. Despite reminders and explanations of the policy, the passenger continued to disregard the requirement, even manipulating the situation by drinking slowly to avoid wearing the mask as they approached landing. Upon landing, the flight attendant informed the Customer Service Agent, who discovered the passenger's return itinerary. The attendant filed a report, leading to a potential suspension of the passenger's travel privileges. However, the passenger's family, who complied with the policy throughout the flight, were not affected.

She put the mask on after Flight Attendant B told her and she removed her mask after the wheels came up and it remained off while not eating or drinking during ascending phase. She then brought out a large bag of popcorn eating it one by one. When she was done with that she would take mini sips of her drink whenever we would walk by to give the appearance of constantly eating or drinking. Because 'briefly eating' leaves a window that is open for debate and we weren't sure what to do and felt because if she presented an attitude when boarding; it would cause a larger than life scene.

This mask was connected to a powered air filter that the passenger wore around their neck. The flight attendant advised the passenger that they could not use the mask with a valve or the air filter, as these were not approved for use on the aircraft. The passenger disputed this, claiming they had been told by reservations that it was acceptable. The attendant attempted to resolve the issue by showing the passenger the airline's policy on face masks, which explicitly prohibited the use of masks with valves. The passenger took a photo of the policy but continued to use the unapproved mask. During the interaction, the passenger's companion complied by switching back to their original neck/face mask, but the passenger did not.

He exhibited rude behavior, became loud, and used profanity. Upon landing, he refused to follow deplaning instructions and stormed off the aircraft. The non-revenue flight attendant commended the FA's handling of the situation. The FA informed the flight deck and filed a report regarding the incident.

He started to get a little [bit] of an attitude and said something about our policy. At that point I found a way to end the conversation because it was going nowhere.

No further action was taken for fear of escalating the situation.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant noticed a passenger, identified as Passenger in XX2, not wearing a face mask during the flight. The attendant approached the passenger, who was asleep, and attempted to enforce the face mask policy. The passenger responded by explaining that he had recently undergone surgery on his nose for cancer and that wearing a mask caused him pain. Despite the attendant's apologies and attempts to explain the policy, the passenger became increasingly argumentative. Recognizing that the situation was escalating and could potentially lead to further conflict, the attendant decided to discontinue the conversation. The attendant then informed another flight attendant, A, about the situation. Together, they concluded that issuing a warning to the passenger might escalate the situation further, especially since there were only 40 minutes of flight time remaining. No other passengers had raised complaints about the individual at that point. The flight attendant ultimately chose not to take further action, opting instead to monitor the situation and address it only if a complaint was received.",disruptive

Flight Attendant B asked her to put the mask on and the passenger said she can't talk on the phone through a mask. Flight Attendant B insisted and the woman begrudgingly put the mask on. As I passed by the passenger she was again not wearing the mask and speaking on her phone. I stood by the seat in front of her waiting for a good break in the conversation for a time to talk with her and she wrapped up the conversation and said sorry and put the phone away. I told her it wasn't an issue with the phone; but the health and safety of those around her. She put her mask on. Shortly thereafter as we were preparing the cabin for departure I noticed her mask was below her nose. She was wearing her headphones and did not hear me; but when she saw me she pulled the mask up over her nose. Based on the attitude she gave Flight Attendant B and the fact that the mask was off again when I came by; and then not properly worn a third time Flight Attendant B and I concurred that if we had to speak with her again it would merit a disciplinary action. We also told the flight deck this; so that they would be aware. Throughout the flight we did have close eyes on her; as one does when a passenger has already exhibited behavior that is against the rules; but I tried not to hound on her. During service I saw her and some others wearing their mask below their nose or off in the long times between sips and I made a PA asking everyone to be compliant (in no way singling her out).Once it came time for final compliance for landing I came back through and again her mask was fully below her nose. I stopped and kneeled down and told her that we had already spoken with her about the mask and that wearing it under the nose does not comply. During the conversation that followed she did not pull her mask over her nose until after I had walked away.She told me that she has a medical condition that makes her light headed and that she has been doing her best with the mask. I told her that while for several months we had mask exemptions for medical cases for the last month it has been mandatory regardless of individual. She asked me for my full name and asked if she could take a picture of my name tag. I told her I was not comfortable giving my last name but if she reached out to the company they would know who I was. She said that I was rude for hounding her and briefly said the word 'Nazi' in reference to my strict adherence to the mask policy and 'targeting' of her.The specifics of timing between what was said during this conversation and what was said in the conversation after I brought disciplinary action and later during final compliance all kind of meld; but these things were said.She said that it was wrong to single out people who have medical conditions and that they don't have to share what the condition is. I reminded her that at no point did I ask her what her condition is and that she only shared that she had a condition at the end of the flight after things came to a head. I also explained again that regardless of condition the mask policy is for anyone who wants to fly.Some guests in the nearby rows thanked me for sticking to the policy as they had had concerns with the passenger in question not wearing her mask throughout the flight. I did my best to thank them for their support; but also to not rile up the non-compliant passenger nor the woman across the aisle who seemed to have befriended and come to the passenger's side (however this woman never spoke up to me or in my earshot). I did not want to put passengers against each other or cause more disruption.Passenger also said that she was not planning on flying [Airline] ever again. We let the Captain know [of the situation] and he called ahead to have a Supervisor meet passenger.

When securing the cabin before door closure she was on phone and had mask looped on one ear and hanging down and I asked her to put it on she said 'but I can't talk on the phone with it' and I said 'I apologize but it has to be worn over your nose and mouth at all times it is our policy' then she just looked at me with an attitude and then I asked her again if she could please put it on to which she said 'sssuurrreeee' and put it on. Then I informed another FA and told him to keep an eye on her and then he immediately walked through the cabin and she had it off again; not even one minute later. So he also asked her to put it on. After safety demo passenger had mask on but not covering her nose FA A asked her to pull it up and make sure it is covering both her nose and mouth.Inflight there were times she took exaggerated time to eat and drink. As were others in the cabin so we made a PA; (overall I bet we made 20 mask policy PAs during the entire flight).Then during descent FA A observed her with it off again. I seen him having a conversation with her so I approached and he mentioned to her the policy and the reasons and the procedure and then told her he would be back.He said she said she knows the policy. And around that time she mentioned to him that she was trying her best but she has a medical condition. She continued to argue with him and ask for his name to file a complaint. Passengers in front of and behind her gave thanks to FA A for enforcing the policy and said he handled it well. I do believe she overheard them praising him. We notified Captain and he informed [the] arrival station.,,Flight attendants reported a passenger did not comply with face mask policy during flight.,"The incident involved a passenger who repeatedly failed to comply with the face mask policy during a flight. Flight attendants initially approached the passenger, who argued about her inability to talk on the phone with the mask on. Despite reminders and policy explanations, the passenger continued to remove her mask, citing a medical condition. The attendants, following company protocols, persisted in their requests, leading to a confrontational exchange where the passenger used derogatory language. The situation was reported to the captain, who arranged for a supervisor to meet the passenger upon landing. The passenger expressed her intention not to fly with the airline again, while other passengers commended the attendants' adherence to safety regulations.

He cursed at me; at that time his female traveling companion told him to stop and to listen.  She said he would comply with crew member instructions.

Passenger boarded the plane without wearing a mask and took a seat in X1. The Fwd FA approached and reminded passenger about the required mask policy. Passenger reluctantly complied and as the FA turned to walk away; the passenger called her an '[expletive]'. After the FA informed us about this; I first asked the FA if passenger is being disruptive. The FA stated that passenger was not. I then asked if she would like me to go speak to the passenger. The FA stated that was not necessary. Finally; I asked if she would like me to request a customer service representative. The FA again said no; the situation is under control and she would let us know if the problem continues. I messaged my Dispatcher to keep them in the loop of what was said. We pushed; de-iced; and while taxing to our assigned runway; I asked the FO to call and make sure there were no further issues in the back. The FA stated that the passenger had fallen asleep; so we elected to continue. About mid-way through the flight; the Fwd FA called up and stated that the passenger had woken up and was starting to cause some disturbances. The FO was already the PF and I asked him to take radios as well. The passenger asked for a cup of water so passenger didn't have to wear the mask because she was 'drinking'. The FAs let this go on for about '30 minutes' (quoting them) and the passenger had not drank any of the water. Passenger again was non-compliant with the mask and both FAs asked passenger three times to wear the mask. At this point; I sent another message asking for a customer service representative to meet us at the gate in ZZZ1 and explained to the Dispatcher everything the FAs had told me. About 5 minutes after that; the Fwd FA called up again. Again; I told the FO his controls; his radios. The FA then explained that the passenger was now starting to 'scream' on the plane and yelled very loudly; '#@%^! I'm not from [foreign country]!' While doing this; proceeded to flip off both FAs. I again messaged our Dispatcher with this information and now requested Security along with the customer service representative. The FAs and I talked back forth regarding passenger danger level. The passenger was remaining in the seat and making no other threatening gestures; so we did not see the need to declare an Emergency. We continued the flight to ZZZ1 with no further incidences. After landing; I had the FO call Ops just to make sure a customer service representative and security were waiting for us at the gate. Upon arrival into the gate; a customer service representative and security officer where indeed right there. The customer service representative immediately came onto the plane and removed the passenger.The FAs did not make any indication and no one told me they suspected the passenger was drunk. Seems as if passenger was just a genuinely disturbed person.We probably should have gotten security or customer service involved at ZZZ because of the name calling. Because the passenger had put on the mask and was making no further threatening behavior; we decided to make a note of it and continue. We all agreed though; that if passenger made one more derogatory comment; we would most likely be removing passenger from the flight. We had no further problems until mid-flight.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger was not compliant with mask policy and being disruptive.

The incident began during boarding when the passenger boarded without a mask, was reminded by the flight attendant (FA), and reluctantly complied. However, the passenger cursed the FA after she turned away. The FA informed the flight crew, and the captain was informed. The captain assessed the situation, determined it was under control, and communicated with dispatch to keep them informed. The flight proceeded, but the passenger became disruptive again mid-flight, refusing to wear the mask and claiming to be ""drinking"" to avoid it. The FAs allowed this for about 30 minutes, but the passenger did not drink. When the passenger continued to be non-compliant, the FAs repeatedly asked her to wear the mask, prompting the captain to request a customer service representative and security. The passenger eventually screamed and flipped off the FAs, leading the captain to message dispatch again and request security. Despite the passenger's disruptive behavior, no emergency was declared. The flight continued to its destination, and upon landing, security and a customer service representative were present. The passenger was removed from the aircraft by the customer service representative. The FAs did not suspect the passenger was intoxicated but believed she was disturbed. The crew agreed that earlier intervention, such as involving security or a customer service representative, could have been warranted due to the initial name-calling.",disruptive

Agents should inform him before he boards that this kind of behavior is illegal and flight attendants can and will in force FAA rules.,,Flight attendants reported finding smokeless cigarette butts and confronting passenger in baggage area.,"The incident involved a passenger (Party2) and a flight attendant (Party1) aboard a flight. The flight attendant discovered three smokeless cigarette butts in the first-class cabin near the passenger's seat. Despite the passenger appearing to sleep with a blanket over his head, the flight attendant noticed the butts and an odor she initially dismissed as clothing scent. Upon deplaning, the flight attendant and a colleague confronted the passenger about the butts, explaining it was a fineable offense. The passenger responded with explicit language, blaming the butts on his pocket and claiming he had already filed a negative review. During the flight, the passenger was confrontational, complaining about alcohol service and using offensive language. He disregarded crew instructions to remain seated and made inappropriate comments. His behavior disrupted the cabin environment and created a hostile atmosphere for the crew.The flight attendants also managed a situation where they allowed extra forms for families with elderly grandparents, despite a shortage. The passenger falsely accused them of misconduct, which was later proven baseless. The result was a disruptive and hostile environment for the crew, prompting concerns about the passenger's potential legal action or future banning from the airline. The flight attendant documented the passenger's behavior, highlighting his defiance and disregard for crew responsibilities.",disruptive

He immediately responded that he was a frequent flyer and didn't have to. I asked him politely stating that it was FAR procedure that bags that size be checked (it was over 21 inches in height and rather wide). He got belligerent and said he would be talking to the airline about the poor treatment. I apologized; stating that I was following procedure. He checked his bag and immediately came back saying he was being abused and that I had been yelling at him. At this point; I asked my Captain to see if there was anything he could do to alleviate his mood. My Captain politely talked to him; and the passenger sat down.Once everyone was on board and I got my final; I immediately did my announcements; count; and shut the door. When I did service; I asked him what he wanted and had him repeat it so I was certain I got it right. I then offered him his complimentary drink or snack because he was entitled to it. He got the [snack] box. I finished service; did a trash run; and as I am eating; he ripped back my galley curtain and demanded that I talk to the guy behind him who was rudely kicking his seat to not; because he should be allowed to keep his seat back. I nodded; and asked the guy behind him in [4C] to refrain from kicking him. It was painfully obvious that he wasn't doing it on purpose. The passenger in question was 6'5 and well over 350 pounds. He was just too big for the seat and was pressing against it; because his legs had nowhere else to go. I offered the passenger in 4C a different seat away from him and the passenger declined calling Passenger X an entitled baby and that he wasn't interested in moving for him. I did not respond in any way to the name calling; as I did not want to further gain Passenger X's ire; but I was very polite to both of them. About 25 minutes to landing; Passenger X asked for coffee. I told him we ran out; but offered to make him some. He declined.Other passengers remarked about his rude behavior and apologized to me. I didn't respond because it is unprofessional to do so. One woman told me I had the patience of a saint. Upon departing; he told the Gate Agent that I was drunk and rude. The Gate Agent talked to me and I explained that he was upset with me. She remarked that I definitely didn't seem drunk; just very happy go lucky.I boarded for the next [flight]. After shutting the doors; I started to do my safety announcements. I get a call from my Captain and notice the police are waiting. He had called the police and told them I was intoxicated. I don't drink. I haven't had alcohol in over 20 years. I explain this to the police and give them a statement and all my identification and information. I tell them I will fully cooperate with them and I am willing to give blood; pee in a cup; and take a drug or breathalyzer test. The police tell me I definitely do not appear to be drunk or on anything; but they must do a breathalyzer on me to document it. I absolutely complied immediately. I am given a breathalyzer and it comes out 00. The police apologized and I immediately go back to work.I will say that I am absolutely distraught that I was put in this situation. I am a very energetic and enthusiastic individual when it comes to doing my announcements. I am disheartened that my manners were misconstrued in anyway as I try to be as completely professional and polite to everyone I meet. I usually have a great time with my passengers and they always come out of my plane with a big smile on their face. I regret that I was unable to please this passenger at all; but I did everything within guidelines of behavior and professionalism. I really don't know what I could have done differently; except try to accept a bag that was too big for the bin.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger became rude and disruptive after having to check in his carry on bag that was too big for the overhead bin.,"The incident involved a flight attendant and a passenger on a flight. The passenger, identified as Passenger X, became disruptive after being asked to check his large carry-on bag, exceeding the overhead bin's size restrictions. The flight attendant followed proper procedures, but Passenger X responded with belligerence, complaining of poor treatment and later accusing the attendant of yelling at him. Despite apologies and attempts to manage the situation, including involving the captain, the passenger's behavior persisted. During the flight, he made further disruptive demands, including regarding another passenger's seat behavior. Upon disembarking, Passenger X falsely accused the flight attendant of being intoxicated. The captain reported this to the authorities, leading to a police investigation. The flight attendant complied with all requested tests, including a breathalyzer, which confirmed no impairment. The investigation concluded with no evidence of intoxication, allowing the attendant to return to work. The attendant expressed regret over the passenger's misinterpretation of her professionalism and energy, emphasizing adherence to protocol.",disruptive

He asked me to close the cockpit door. As I was trying to close the cockpit door with no success; I continued to try 2 more times; when the Captain shouted angrily! 'Don't slam the damn door.' He repeated it several times; while slamming his hand on the Yoke! 'Don't you ever slam that door again; I'm sick of flight attendants slamming this door.' This was clearly a loss of temper heard by other crewmembers. I stood in fright and shock. After a moment; I told him his outburst was unacceptable and unprofessional for my attempts to close the door. It was then that First Officer explained how the door could be closed. He realized that the door closing mechanism switch (red toggle switch) was not engaged and was preventing me from shutting the door. The door was finally closed; and we departed. There are other events that gave me serious concerns about Captain [name removed].During the flight; the Captain asked for a bathroom break. I was terrified of being alone with him; so I asked another Flight Attendant to stay with me while I stood by the cart barricade. When he came out of the cockpit; he tried to intimidate me by staring me down; I ignored him. When he was finished using the lavatory; Flight Attendant [name removed] and myself noticed Captain fumbling with the keypad on the cockpit door; after several attempts; we were concerned. Flight Attendant [name removed] told him not to press so many numbers; as it would lock him out. He clearly did not know the door code; Flight Attendant [name removed] told him the door code.Captain [name removed] made it clear to us that he did not want us to use the door key pad; he wanted us to call the cockpit whenever we are to enter the cockpit. This is not in the Standard Operating procedures for flight attendants.During his briefing; he told us that while he's taxiing and if a passenger goes to the lavatory; he doesn't want us to call him; because he does not consider these events 'important or an emergency.'I am reporting this event as a 'Hostile Workplace Environment Incident' and that the matter be forwarded to the proper administrative forum. I make no personal request or recommendation for resolution as there should be standard procedure for handling 'Hostile Workplace Incidents.',,,,Flight Attendant reported a negative interaction with the Captain.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant (Party 1) and the Captain (Party 2) of the flight crew. During the pre-flight preparation, the Flight Attendant attempted to close the cockpit door but was unsuccessful. The Captain became visibly angry, repeatedly shouting at the Flight Attendant not to slam the door, which was witnessed by other crew members. After the Flight Attendant expressed concerns about the Captain's outburst, the First Officer intervened and explained that the door closing mechanism switch was not engaged, preventing the door from closing. The issue was resolved after the door was successfully closed. During the flight, the Captain requested a bathroom break, and the Flight Attendant expressed fear of being alone with him, asking another Flight Attendant to stay nearby. The Captain reportedly attempted to intimidate the Flight Attendant after using the restroom and appeared confused while trying to input the cockpit door code. The Flight Attendant intervened and provided the code, noting that the Captain did not know it. The Captain also instructed the crew not to use the door keypad, which is not in line with standard operating procedures. The Flight Attendant reported the incident as a ""Hostile Workplace Environment Incident,"" citing the Captain's unprofessional behavior, including his disregard for safety protocols and intimidating actions.

He had trouble getting bags in bin and slammed bins. He approached fwd galley asking C Flight Attendant for Band-aid with finger bleeding. The OPS agent came to finish up and I asked him what was going on with this passenger. I was told he was okay; they couldn't smell alcohol on him. He was probably tired from being out with business friends during the night. I voiced my concern of his wobbling; and his very slow movements and drifting off. I was told he was fine. The door was closed. During takeoff; he was loud trying to engage passenger in 1-A who feigned sleep. During service; he continually got up for the forward galley restroom but could not find the door; even trying the cockpit door. I stayed in the galley unless he was sleeping during most of the entire flight for security reasons. The B and C flight attendants were made aware of the situation. He continued his lavatory routine many times. At one point; he was returning to his seat and I heard a thud. He had fallen into the bulkhead row and was picking himself getting back to his seat. I asked if he was ok and he at first didn't respond. I asked again and he mumbled yes. I went back to fwd galley and I turned; he was right there backing me up saying he went to the doctor and had taken codeine and I had no right to ask him anything. I explained that I wanted to be sure he had not injured himself with the fall. He returned to his seat. He then shouted that he wanted my name. I stepped to the aisle and stated [my name]. He wanted my last name which I said we do not give out [last names] but [Company] has that info and knows who is working. He was upset. I turned to my galley and he jumped up and came at me with his phone and snapped my picture. I immediately asked him to delete it. He returned to his seat saying NO. I calmly told him that he cannot take a crew members picture without permission and he needed to delete it or have ground personnel meet the plane when we land. He refused. So I clearly stated; you are making the choice to have someone meet the aircraft because you are refusing to delete the picture. He just sat mumbling. The C Flight Attendant had come forward at that time and saw most of this. She then went back to take care of the cabin. I did tell her I was going to inform the Captain and ask for ground assistance. I did call the Captain; however; at that time; they were being diverted due to runway issues in ZZZ so he told me he would get back to me. I stayed in the galley waiting for the Captain to call. I was cleaning up when this passenger; who had been mumbling and talking most of this time; came up at me again; backing me up saying I was going down the wrong path with him. I firmly told him to sit down. The Captain called and informed the crew of the diversion and ZZZ issues. He asked about the passenger situation. I quickly gave a summary and asked for ground assistance. We diverted to ZZZ1. On landing; this passenger jumped up to get his bags saying he was leaving. Ops met the plane and police were quickly there along with ground Supervisor. I gave a statement to police. We received witness names and numbers along with a statement from a passenger who witnessed this passenger in [departure airport] in the gate area. This was given to police.Stop allowing passengers that are clearly under the influence of something to board. I don't know what else to say. These passengers are allowed and enabled. There should be no arguement or debate. If someone is asking if you have been drinking or taking medication; then it's a pretty good bet your behavior brought attention to you. Flight crew DOES look out for these issues. Our FAR states we cannot let them onboard. WE do not! We bring attention to the OPS agent or Supervisor or; our Captains; and then we are continually told 'they are fine' or 'they will sleep' or 'this is the last flight out'. Someone has to stop allowing this. Deny boarding; and stopenabling this behavior. Alcohol related issues are one of the biggest conversations among crew. [The passengers] expect ENDLESS alcohol. Drugs are unseen and are hard to detect but just as dangerous; and then you mix the two. Something has to be done to stop allowing this without there being serious consequences to the passenger! This situation has shown me just how vulnerable we are. I could have been physically hurt. I was trapped by this man. For the entire flight; I was on the highest alert in my head. My anxiety level hit me after we landed back in base. I am still having anxiety each time I have to file a report. My passengers could have been hurt. My Captain was busy with a last minute flight diversion due to runway issues in ZZZ; and had to acknowledge this situation. This puts everyone in harm's way. This man should NEVER have been ALLOWED on this aircraft. One of the witness statements was that he observed this man in [departure airport] and was shocked he was allowed on the aircraft at the very last minute. 74 people were trapped at 35K with him.

FA (Flight Attendant) X was not in compliance the first day of work. [She] was eating out of first class basket before anyone was served; not briefing the exit row before main cabin door was closed and texting once she finished her service. The second day; FA X was working first class. When we arrived in ZZZ with almost a four hours and a half sit; I arrived in the crew lounge and was watching TV. FA X came in shortly after me [while] I was watching TV and texting. I look up and FA X pulls the plug from the TV and I said to FA X why are you behaving like this?FA X said you are not watching TV and I said I was and did not appreciate her behavior and she said she would do again if I turn the TV back on and she did for a second time. This time ripped it out of the wall and I said to FA X you are being disrespectful and to not do that again. She left the room; came back at the same time another crew member came in the room. She had her phone so loud. FA Y said would you please turn your phone down. She said that the volume was on the lowest setting for her phone. FA Y offered FA X headphones. She said they would not work on her phone. The show FA X was watching was using profanity every other word and it was very loud. Any crew member who walked in immediately walked out and sat outside the crew room. FA Y and myself left the room. We both felt very uncomfortable with FA X's behavior. The crew room is supposed to be a place to rest and relax. I did not feel comfortable with FA X's behavior [and] called my manager and explained what had happened and to see if once we arrived [at our destination;] if another FA could take her place. The manager said I know you have high expectations and informed me this was a CRM [issue] and we needed to work things out. Requested at some point to send an email in regards to what happened. When we arrived in ZZZ1; it was late and I was very tired and had an early report the next day. Did not have time to do a report in regards to the CRM. Following our ZZZ sit; I arrived to the aircraft for our next trip to ZZZ1; FA X said we needed to make it through these next 2 days. She was not sure what came over her in the crew room. I agreed with FA X let's work together. We performed our safety demo and part of the demo was to wear the life vest and performed how to wear the vest. FA X would only hold the vest during our demo. After our demo; I mentioned she needs to wear it versus holding it. On the third day of our first leg; FA X was leaving bins half open and the closet door open. This happened more than 8 times and had requested to please make sure they are closed and locked. She would just look at me and walked away. The service cart was left unattended at the exit row. FA X left her service cart and walk to the front galley and called the flight deck. I saw the cart sitting in the aisle at row 12. We did have turbulence on and off during the flight. I walk back to the cart and checked with passengers for service. She was requesting [that] a passenger wanted to purchase Pringles. Prior to FA X making the call to the flight deck; FA X had touched the FA call button twice in a row and I held my index finger to say give me a minute with okay I will be there. I was in the middle of my service with first class.I was not comfortable and felt the safety on the aircraft for the passengers and myself was not safe and FA X would not comply with the safety of the aircraft. I had requested for a manager to meet the aircraft once we arrived at our destination due to the situation through ACARS.I was not sure what the reason was for her calling the flight deck. I spoke to the flight deck in regards to problems of safety in flight. FA X called the flight deck and said I was ignoring her and not helping her on requested items. I explained as before; I was serving first class and [I] would be there shortly. I said to the CA (Captain) [that]there was a communication problem and FA X was leaving bins opened and unlocked service cart left in the aisle at row 12. FA X walked up to [the] galley to call the flight deck and left the cart in the aisle. I requested the flight deck to please notify ACARS there was an issue with safety on board and FA X was not keeping the bins closed and locked; left her cart at the exit row and not talking to me. After FA X's service in the main cabin; she began texting on her phone for the remainder of the flight and would not respond to me.On arrival; two regional managers came to the aircraft to talk and discuss the issues. I had explained to FA X; once all passengers had left the aircraft; a manager would be coming to talk with us in regards to our flight. Before I could address the reason for the call; FA X started the conversation in regards to the incident in ZZZ crew room and made false accusations in regards to what happened to the point of making up things that did not occur. The main reason for the meeting was to discuss the safety issues. I explained the issues of FA X not listening to my request to please lock and close all bins and several occasions to please close the closet door after she opened it to remove an item. The manager asked if we both could work this flight together if not; and you choose not to; you will have a missed trip and a meeting with a manager. FA X said she was okay and I said I had a problem flying with FA X from inflight safety as well making false accusations that did not occur.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that the work environment was very stressful due to the cabin crew pairing.,"The incident involved two flight attendants, FA X and FA Y, on a flight operated by an air carrier. FA Y reported that the work environment became increasingly stressful due to FA X's non-compliant and disrespectful behavior. On the first day, FA X violated protocols by eating from the first-class basket before service, failing to brief the exit row, and texting after completing her duties. The following day, during a layover, FA X disrupted the crew lounge by unplugging the TV, leading to a confrontation. FA X's behavior in the crew room was deemed disrespectful and uncomfortable by other crew members, prompting FA Y to contact management and request a replacement. Despite management's suggestion to resolve the CRM issues, FA Y did not file a report due to fatigue. Subsequent days saw continued non-compliance from FA X, including failing to secure bins, leaving the service cart unattended, and making disruptive calls to the flight deck. During turbulence, FA X was observed texting and ignoring safety protocols, leading FA Y to inform the flight deck about safety concerns. Upon arrival, managers met with the crew, where FA X made false accusations. The managers facilitated a discussion, with both agreeing to continue working together, though FA Y expressed ongoing concerns about safety and false allegations. In summary, the incident stemmed from FA X's repeated non-compliance and disrespectful behavior, leading to a CRM breakdown. Management介入 aimed to address the issues, but FA Y's concerns about safety and accuracy highlighted the need for continued attention.",disruptive

We called the flight attendants and (in accordance with standard operating procedures) the FO stepped out of the cockpit and a FA came in; closing the cockpit door behind him. While the FO was in the lavatory; a female passenger came up to the forward galley. The FA informed her that she must use one of the lavatories in the back of the aircraft or return to her seat; but that she could not remain in the forward galley. The passenger was Hispanic and claimed not to understand the FA. Luckily; all three of the FAs spoke fluent Spanish and it was again explained in Spanish. The passenger still refused to move and she verbally abused and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA came up to assist. The 'A' FA called up to inform me what was going on. I could hear loud voices over the interphone and the FAs speaking to the passenger in Spanish. Meanwhile; the FO had exited the lavatory and was now also in the galley. After several more minutes; the passenger's husband came up and convinced her to return to her seat. After she was seated and with the three FAs plus the male deadheading FA guarding and blocking access to the forward galley and the cockpit door; the cockpit door was opened and the FA exited the cockpit and the FO entered. We then locked down the cockpit in accordance with a Threat Level 1. I contacted Dispatch with our status and requested to have law enforcement meet the aircraft in ZZZ. After arriving in ZZZ; law enforcement removed the passenger from the aircraft.After speaking with the FO over the interphone; and visually confirming the galley was secure; I determined that it was safer and more prudent to have the FO in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. This scenario needs to be addressed during recurrent security training. What is the safest course of action if the cockpit is locked down with one of the pilots in the cabin? If it is determined that keeping the cockpit on lockdown is the safest course; where should the FA sit? In the jumpseat or in a pilot seat?,The reporter stated that this encounter with a passenger was more of a misunderstanding; but it brought up the bigger issue of what to do if the threat is real. If a real threat was just outside the cockpit door with the first officer out of the cockpit with a single pilot and flight attendant in the cockpit; what is the proper procedure? Do you put the FA in the pilot's seat where they have access to the flight controls; but you can keep an eye on him/her? Do you put the FA in the jumpseat where you can't see them? The reporter mused 'could the FA be in on it'; what is really happening on the other side of the door? The reporter stated that he feels unprepared for which procedure should the pilot use for these type of scenarios. He feels more training should occur addressing these issues.,,,B737-800 Captain reported that a passenger refused to leave the forward galley while the First Officer was using the forward lavatory causing a security issue.,"The incident occurred during the cruise phase of a B737-800 flight about 45 minutes prior to landing at ZZZ. The First Officer (FO) required a physiological break and temporarily left the cockpit to use the forward lavatory. A flight attendant (FA) entered the cockpit in accordance with standard procedures, closing the door behind them. During the FO's absence, a Hispanic passenger approached the forward galley. The FA instructed the passenger to either use one of the rear lavatories or return to her seat, as she was not permitted to remain in the galley. The passenger, who did not understand English, was initially uncooperative. However, the three FAs, who spoke fluent Spanish, repeatedly explained the situation. Despite this, the passenger refused to comply, verbally abused, and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA was called to assist. The 'A' FA informed the Captain via interphone, who heard loud voices and ongoing dialogue between the FAs and the passenger in Spanish. The FO, having exited the lavatory, joined the situation in the galley. After several minutes, the passenger's husband intervened and persuaded her to return to her seat. With the passenger seated and the FAs, including the male deadheading FA, positioned to block access to the forward galley and cockpit door, the cockpit door was opened. The FA exited the cockpit, and the FO returned. The cockpit was then secured in accordance with Threat Level 1 protocols. Upon arrival at ZZZ, law enforcement was summoned to remove the passenger from the aircraft. The Captain, after consulting with the FO and visually confirming the galley's security, determined it was safer for the FO to remain in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. The incident highlighted the need for recurrent security training, particularly addressing scenarios where the cockpit is locked down with one pilot in the cabin. The discussion raised questions about the safest seating arrangement for an FA in such situations—whether in the jumpseat or a pilot seat.",disruptive

I was working in A position on the aircraft; a sold out flight with two jump seats occupied. A pre-boarding Customer was listed on my specials report as having a vision impairment and having a working assistance animal. I met the Customer in the jetbridge and offered my assistance; to which he refused. The Customer's service animal appeared to be a full sized golden lab.The Customer proceeded to sit in a bulkhead row aisle seat on this aircraft. I informed the Customer that he would need to sit in the window seat so that his service animal would not hinder the egress of Customers sitting outboard of him. The Customer informed me that he was not going to move to the window seat; that he knew his rights and that he had every right to sit in the aisle seat and that he didn't have to occupy the window seat if he didn't want too. He informed me that his dog was not going to be in the aisle and would not obstruct the aisle. I explained to him that the aisle was not my greatest concern; that the animal was in fact obstructing access to the aisle for the two yet to be occupied seats. The Customer still refused to move. Sensing that the customer was going to be difficult to deal with; I simply replied with; 'Ok' and continued with the boarding process.I pulled out my EFAM (Flight Attendant Manual) and conducted a search to make sure that I was in-line with [Company] policies and procedures. I also asked assistance from my B to help with the search so I could face my customers as they boarded the aircraft. Our search quickly found what we were looking for. [In the FAM] it stipulates that an assistance animal 'May not obstruct an aisle or access to an aisle.'  I informed a ramp agent in the jetbridge that I would need a representative to address the situation and they informed my Ops Agent. I informed my Captain of the situation.Boarding was complete and I still didn't have a representative. Ops Agent again called and Ops Supervisor came to assist. I explained the situation to Ops Sup and Captain and showed them the aforementioned FAM requirements for assistance animals. Captain reviewed the FAM for several minutes to ensure there was no grey area around the policies and procedures. We as a team; all 4 Flight Attendants; our Captain; our Ops Agent and our Ops Supervisor all found ourselves in agreement that the Customer with the assistance animal would need to sit in the window seat in order to meet our safety regulations. Ops Sup was tasked with engaging the Customer with the assistance animal and asking him to swap seats to the window seat. Ops Sup explained everything to the Customer and was rejected just as I was; but this time with all the seats full of Customers; Ops Sup found himself at the end of the stick. Customers who had no reason to be engaged in the conversation with Ops Sup found themselves yelling at Ops Sup; telling him that the disabled Customer had rights and that he didn't have to move if he didn't want too. Ops Sup left the aircraft and made a call to Customer Service to get their stance on the conflict. They backed the direction of the FAM and crew and directed Ops Sup to again ask the Customer with the assistance animal to move one last time or to remove him from the flight for non-compliance with safety regulations. Again; Ops Sup engaged the Customer and the Customer refused to move. He even said that he wasn't getting off the aircraft; period. With that Ops Sup was left with only one option; to call the police and have the Customer physical removed from the aircraft for his refusal to comply with the required safety regulations. After 10 minutes of waiting for the police; Ops Sup called the police again as they still hadn't shown up. The Customers in the row tried repeatedly to get the Customer with the assistance animal to move to the window seat but he refused. Everyonejust wanted to get the flight under way.After nearly 30 minutes the Customer with the assistance animal finally agreed to take the window seat; at the convincing of the Customers in his row. He was angry and told everyone that this was going to be their last day on the job. He stated that he wasn't going to leave the [arrival] airport until he had received justice for the injustices against him. The police never showed up. During the flight the Customer showed no aggression and other than using the forward lavatory three times; stayed in the window seat. He had a Jack and Coke which I comped. Upon arrival; the Ops Agent approached me regarding a known difficult Customer. I gave him the rundown of what happened so that he could alert his leadership team. The Customer and his supporters did in fact give the Customer Service and Ops team a difficult time in the gate area. Leadership informed the Customer that he needed to get in touch with Customer Service.Customers need to abide by the required safety regulations; including Customers with disabilities. Maybe the ACAA (Air Carrier Access Act) could assist the airlines and their members by informing their members of what they can do to avoid conflict on an aircraft and how follow the safety regulations that airlines must enforce. As for flight crews; everyone must be on the same page in enforcing the safety regulations. When one crew lets safety slide; the rest of us hear about it from the Customers.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported an encounter with a visually handicapped; dog-assisted passenger who refused a window seat thus failing to comply with company aisle obstruction regulations. The passenger voluntarily moved to a window seat after a threatened removal from the flight.,"The incident involved a visually impaired passenger with a service dog on a sold-out flight. The flight attendant requested the passenger to move to a window seat to prevent obstruction of aisle access, as per company policies. The passenger refused, citing his rights, leading to a prolonged delay as the crew and supervisors attempted to resolve the issue. The situation escalated when the police were threatened with being called, though they didn't arrive. Eventually, other passengers persuaded the man to move, allowing the flight to proceed. The passenger remained agitated but compliant. Post-landing, he caused a scene, prompting leadership to direct him to contact customer service. The flight attendant suggested that the ACAA could aid in educating passengers to prevent such conflicts, emphasizing the need for consistent enforcement of safety regulations.",disruptive

At the time of walk through his seatbelt was undone was under his feet in aisle and newspaper was under his feet. I requested he stow bag and laptop and fasten seatbelt and asked if newspaper was trash could I take it for him. He said no he was reading it so I asked him to remove it from floor in exit row so no one would get hurt if we actually had to use exit; then I continued down aisle. On passing him on my way back he still had not complied with one thing I said. I seriously thought about removing him from exit seat; but did not want to escalate situation. So I made the same request AGAIN. He told me he was keeping his laptop on his lap because he could. I was wrong. I then informed him that I was not wrong and that it was in my manual as such and I would be happy to show him. Finally he said I will put it away but you are wrong and then told to LEAVE HIM ALONE. I talked to the CA of the situation. CA told me to show him in magazine where it is required to stow laptops. I didn't because as I said it would have escalated. This sort of behavior is unacceptable in exit row passenger. This man was of course one of the airline's [high] mile passenger. It is a shame because they hold a status that we cannot do our jobs.

Customer mentioned that they already paid Business Class fare and since now is seated in Economy Class; I should not charge for the food. I politely ask for the full name and check my name list. Since the name was not on the list; I explained that I can't compliment a meal. Customer started to complain about how bad Customer Service is and will write me to the company if I charged for the food. I apologize for what happened in earlier flight but I did not have all the information and suggested that they can write feedback to the company online. Customer seems to be more agitated and refused to listen and continue verbal abuse to me; saying that will make a big case about this incident and make sure the social media get my name and the company will fire me. At this moment; I realize that the situation will escalate; so I decided to remove myself from the situation by saying 'Please enjoy your wrap for now and we can have this conversation after the service' and proceed to the next row.

When I returned to the Cockpit to start back to my flight Duties; I was informed from the acting Copilot that they had dealt with an unintentional None Crew Person entry into the Cockpit.  Although shocked; after listening to how it had happened I could see how it might have been able to.  The Flight Attendant misunderstood the FO's request to tell his son that they were passing near Greenland for him to take a look.   When I later went back for a washroom break just prior to the landing at ORD; I also talked with the Flight Attendant about his required procedures with the entry into the Cockpit and the Cockpit Door opening. Also reminded him if he ever felt that a request of that nature is what he heard; he best clarify and to just speak up and ask if that was what was asked of him.  Also knowing his responsibilities and training; to just refuse such a request. Had he just asked to clarify; or refused the request none of this would have happened.,,We were at cruise during the second portion of the scheduled pilot break. The Captain was on his break and myself and the relief FO were in the cockpit. As we were approaching Greenland; I called the forward galley to inform Flight Attendant that the weather ahead was nice with good visibility; since he had asked me earlier if we were going to be able to see Greenland. He asked if he could come up to the cockpit. I told him that would be fine; since this would give me an opportunity to take a lavatory break after he came to the cockpit. He said he would call back when the area was clear and he would be ready. The relief FO then called back to the forward flight attendant station and asked whoever it was that answered the phone if they would inform his son who was riding in the cabin that he look outside his window to see Greenland. Subsequently; the Flight Attendant called to say he was ready and would be at the door. I then went to the door and looked out the door viewing port. It was dark outside the door; but I could see his face as he was close to the door. I didn't see anyone else; as the son was much shorter. I then opened the door and stepped back. At that point; the son had already stepped in and the Flight Attendant was following him into the cockpit. As the door was closing behind them; I recalled our security training which emphasized keeping the door open as short a time as possible (three seconds ideally) and realized the safest thing to do was to close the door and sort it out with the cockpit secure. We then called back to confirm the area was still secure and arranged to have them exit the cockpit as quickly as possible. After discussing the error; it appears to have been a misunderstanding about bringing the boy to the cockpit versus pointing out the view.,,A B767 crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit in flight.,"The incident involved an unintended breach of cockpit security on a B767 flight. During the flight, a crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit due to a misunderstanding. The relief First Officer (FO) requested the Flight Attendant to inform the child to look out for a view of Greenland. The Flight Attendant misinterpreted this as an invitation for the child to enter the cockpit. Consequently, the child entered the cockpit, followed by the Flight Attendant. Upon realizing the oversight, the FO secured the cockpit and ensured the child and Flight Attendant were promptly escorted out. The situation was resolved without further complications. The Captain later addressed the Flight Attendant, emphasizing the importance of adhering to security protocols and clarifying instructions to prevent such incidents in the future. The Flight Attendant was reminded to refuse or clarify ambiguous requests regarding cockpit access to ensure passenger and crew safety.",disruptive

I could hear through my headset and the flight deck door some sort of commotion that sounded like voices. I thought it was slightly unusual; but we were close to landing; [and] I wasn't sure if the flight attendants were simply doing their last minute duties before landing. On the landing rollout turn onto a high speed taxiway; we got a call from the flight attendants. My Captain and I recognized it and both agreed we were going to address it as soon as we completed our after landing duties since we were still slowing down and in a very high workload environment between the normal flows; checklist; and call to ops. Before we could complete our after landing flows; however; the flight attendants then called using the 'emergency' call button. The Captain immediately stopped the plane and informed ATC while I talked to the flight attendants. The flight attendants told us we had a belligerent passenger; who had taken her seat belt off during approach and was walking around the cabin. I relayed this information to the Captain. We tried to ascertain what the current status of the passenger was to determine if she was still a threat. The flight attendants said she had returned to her seat with her seat belt fastened. Following the Captain's direction; I asked the flight attendant if they thought we needed a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) to meet us at the gate; since the information we were getting appeared to indicate that the passenger had returned to her seat and fastened her seat belt and was complying. After a pause and the flight attendant's clear hesitation on making this decision; I suggested that we'd have a LEO meet us at the gate; which the flight attendants agreed was a good decision. I called ops; and worked through arranging a LEO to meet us at the gate. Unfortunately; in the chaos ops didn't know we were on the ground in LAX because our ACARS had failed midair on that leg. This resulted in some delay getting the ground crew to the gate to marshal us in and then waiting for the LEO to meet us at the gate after we had parked. We delayed deplaning the aircraft until the LEO could escort the passenger off the plane.I saw the passenger briefly in the jet bridge hitting the LEO while the LEO explained to her that she would be arrested [if] she didn't stop. I left to do my walk around; and when I returned; I saw her being carried away in handcuffs by two LEOs up the jet bridge.As the incident occurred we were informed that it was alcohol-related; and the passenger was clearly intoxicated. She had been served two alcoholic beverages during the flight; and according to the flight attendants; was perfectly normal after 1; but the second resulted in her belligerent behavior.Passengers being disruptive are a part of air travel; but there were a few lessons I learned to help make it smoother with less operational disruptions. First; explain to the flight attendants that they should let us know quickly if there's a potential problem. On final approach; one of us could conceivably have answered a call early on knowing there was simply an issue with a passenger. Then we could have called back when we had finished our initial after landing duties and better managed the workload.While the Captain and I performed great CRM during the whole event (clearly dividing who was doing what - Captain did taxiing and communicating with ATC while I talked with the flight attendants and coordinated with ops); things changed when our first form of communication with the flight attendants was after they had pushed the emergency call button. The Captain and I both feared when we saw that light go on that we might have been on fire or some other emergency requiring evacuation onto the taxiway. The Captain later informed the flight attendants that we were going to get to the situation as quickly as it was safe to do so; but the emergency callbutton might not have been necessary since at the time they called the passenger was in her seat with her seat belt fastened.Finally; I believe one of the important things for the flight attendants to learn is how much we pilots rely on them to paint a picture of what is happening in the cabin in a situation like this. Initially when they called up; it sounded like it was a minor issue that was under control and wouldn't require any special assistance; and it took a long time to come to the conclusion to pull the trigger on having security meet us at the gate. When we exited the flight deck at the gate; the Captain and I agreed that there was no doubt we needed security to meet us (and the Captain commented that if she'd been displaying that behavior when she boarded the flight; she would have still been in [departure airport] at the gate); as even though she was in her seat; she still was not complying with instructions and posing a threat to those around her (as evidenced by her repeatedly hitting the calm LEO while in the jet bridge). Having gotten this information better communicated to us would have allowed us to get to the gate quicker since we were stopped on the taxiway during the whole conversation with the flight attendants. While in this incident it did not make a difference; a different situation might result in a passenger being more physically aggressive; making a quick decision allow for a sooner end to the scenario with less damage or injury to passengers and crew. And while not as important; a quicker decision would have also mitigated some of the delay that this incident caused to the remaining flights of the day.,,,,Air Carrier First Officer reported that an unruly passenger disrupted the cabin shortly before landing.,"During a flight approaching Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), a passenger became unruly and disruptive after consuming two alcoholic beverages. The passenger removed her seatbelt during the approach, walked around the cabin, and refused to comply with crew instructions, despite returning to her seat and fastening her seatbelt. The flight attendants initially contacted the flight deck, reporting the situation. When the passenger's behavior continued to escalate, the flight attendants activated the emergency call button, prompting the flight crew to stop the aircraft and coordinate with air traffic control (ATC) and ground operations. The flight crew, with the assistance of law enforcement, delayed deplaning until the passenger could be escorted off the aircraft. The passenger was eventually removed by security after becoming physically aggressive with the law enforcement officer. The incident was attributed to alcohol-related behavior and resulted in delays due to communication challenges, as the aircraft's ACARS system had failed, complicating coordination with ground staff. The flight crew emphasized the importance of clear and timely communication from the flight attendants regarding potential cabin issues. They suggested that earlier notification of the situation could have allowed for better management of workload and a smoother response. Additionally, the flight crew highlighted the need for flight attendants to provide a more detailed account of cabin events to help pilots assess the situation accurately and make informed decisions.",disruptive

As I was contemplating asking if he needed to use his concentrator during all phases of the flight; I checked my manifest and noticed he wasn't even listed as having an O2 concentrator. As I was about to ask him a question or two; the passenger in 13B asked me if his (12B) O2 bottle ran out; would we have O2 bottles for him to use on board. I almost chuckled as I said 'he's not using O2 from a bottle; it's an O2 concentrator; but we have no info about it even being on board.' She replied that he indeed was using an O2 bottle as he has lung cancer and only 25% use of one of his lungs. I must have had a very odd look on my face as I said 'but he can't bring his own O2 bottle on board an aircraft; totally not allowed!' 'How did you get past the TSA?' She said they discovered the bottle; took it; checked it out; and returned it saying it was okay. My comment was 'they what?' 'So; no one else was informed that you had this and intended to use it on the plane? Turn it off please; now.' I went and retrieved one of our Portable Oxygen Bottles (POBs) and asked the D flight attendant to tell the A flight attendant to notify the flight deck. The passenger in 13B was the girlfriend of the passenger in 12B. She also told me he has used his own POB on many other flights before. She didn't say which airline.Being the C flight attendant; I'm not allowed to be forward of the exit rows for boarding; nor would I leave my cabin area of responsibility prior to takeoff. After takeoff; I'm setting up my cart as the B and D flight attendants are [completing other service duties]. So; not sure how I could have done anything different due to my position. Had I been working a position where I would have seen Mr. [12 B] on what I would have assumed was an O2 concentrator; I would have looked at my manifest to see if he was listed as using one. I would have then asked him if he needed to use it during all phases of flight including takeoff and landing; where I may have asked to move him to a window seat so as not to block/hamper other passengers egress to the main aisle in an emergency. That exchange most likely would have brought about a discovery of an O2 bottle and not a concentrator.I think lesson #1 is never assume a darn thing! Many passengers are not aware they need to disclose plans to use an O2 concentrator and I have watched them come onboard only to discover they aren't listed on my manifest. I then have time to contact an agent to see if they are aware of it and it just hasn't showed up on my manifest yet. I strongly suggest all flight attendants be very aware of passengers using O2 and watch for the device when passengers are boarding; then verify we all know about it. None of that would have mattered in this instance as his O2 bottle was concealed in a small black oblong bag. Boarding an aircraft is a crazy busy time for all concerned. All the more reason to be alert then; as well as any time after takeoff; to things like a passengers using (what should only be) an O2 concentrator and checking to make sure they are listed in our manifest or the proper tag has been placed on it by our agents.,,,,Flight Attendant reported discovering a lung cancer patient inhaling oxygen from a personal bottle not listed on the manifest.

There seems to be a pattern of passengers not complying with flight attendant instructions. Generally seat belt sign; or getting prepared for takeoff or landing; getting up after the 10;000 feet announcement; arguing general requests regarding safety etc. Some of this I attribute to passengers using their own electronic devices and earphones prior to takeoff and landing and therefore cannot hear our announcements. Some is just a sense of entitlement and their rights to do as they wish regardless of our instructions. On this particular flight; passengers were getting up and using the restrooms on our approach. Passengers were still putting away bags in the overheads after we had completed our checks and passengers were delaying turning off lap tops after several requests for them to do so.

The flight attendant delayed reporting to determine if the behavior was isolated but observed it consistently across multiple flights, prompting the filing of this report. No specific solution was proposed in the context.",disruptive

I asked him to stow it. He became defensive and loudly said to me 'NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED ME TO DO THAT.' I asked again; and explained it was considered a carry on and therefore needed to go in the overhead; as he had no seat in front of him to stow it underneath. He again stated he had never been told to do that. He opened it and started to remove paperwork and personal items; and the passenger next to him asked me if that was ok. I said; yes he could secure those items in his hand; but not the backpack. I then placed the backpack in the overhead.As we were on the taxiway same passenger was on his phone. Passenger behind him looked at me to get my attention and pointed; at passenger and his phone and mouthed to me 'he is on the internet.' I tapped passenger on his shoe to get his attention and asked if he was in airplane mode. He replies; loudly; 'YES I AM AND WILL YOU STOP TOUCHING ME?' I answered; 'of course.' Passenger behind him; then taps him on the shoulder and says; 'I would appreciate it if you would do as you are asked; and get off your phone.' The father of the disruptive passenger turns around and states the son is using a certain app that isn't on the internet. The passenger who spoke up; looks at me and shakes his head. The disruptive passenger does not comply. When I hear the after takeoff chime; I go to the back galley and explain to [other Flight Attendant] what has been happening. We decide to switch and she will now [takes that part of the cabin]. This switch avoided further conflict between the disruptive passenger and myself. I don't believe I committed any errors. Passenger was not receptive to following directions; or to any verbal contact with me.,,,,A Flight Attendant reported that a passenger was not compliant in regard to stowing of baggage and electronic device usage.,"The incident began when a flight attendant (Party1) noticed a passenger (Party2) with a small backpack on his lap during the final cabin walk-through. The attendant asked the passenger to stow the backpack in the overhead bin, as it was considered carry-on luggage. The passenger became defensive, refusing to comply and stating that no one had ever asked him to do so. The situation escalated when the passenger opened the backpack and began removing items, despite the attendant's instructions to secure the items but not the backpack itself. The passenger continued to disregard the attendant's directives. Later, during taxiing, the passenger was observed using a phone, which drew the attention of another passenger who questioned whether it was permitted. The attendant tapped the passenger on the shoe to address the issue, asking if he was in airplane mode. The passenger loudly confirmed but became confrontational, telling the attendant to stop touching him. The passenger seated behind him then intervened, asking the disruptive passenger to follow instructions. The father of the disruptive passenger intervened, claiming the son was using an app that was not on the internet. The attendant decided to switch cabin sections to avoid further conflict, delegating the area to another flight attendant (Party1's colleague). This action aimed to de-escalate the situation and prevent further disruption. The flight attendant believed she handled the situation appropriately and did not feel she had made any errors. The disruptive passenger remained non-compliant and unresponsive to instructions. The incident was resolved without further escalation, as the attendant successfully transferred responsibility for the area to a colleague. The flight attendant's decision to switch cabin sections and transfer responsibility to another crew member was the proposed solution to avoid further conflict.",disruptive

I asked Mr. X to buckle his seatbelt and that is when his wife; Mrs. X; seated in XXE; advised me that Mr. X suffered from dementia. I proceeded to assist Mr. X and buckled his seatbelt around him. While completing our safety checks for landing; I noticed that Mr. X did not have his seatbelt fastened. I again asked Mr. X to buckle up for landing. He was not complying; so I assisted Mr. X by buckling his seatbelt for him. I proceeded to my jumpseat and buckled in. While seated I had heard the noises of a seatbelt being unbuckled. I turned around and looked up the aisle toward the forward part of the aircraft and noticed that Mr. X had his seatbelt unbuckled and hanging in the aisle. I proceeded to get up and inform Mr. X that his seatbelt need to be fastened for landing. He made some unrecognizable noises and words and proceeded to stand up and enter the aisle of the aircraft. I advised Mr. X that he needed to seated for landing. There was a lady passenger seated in front of him in XYD that had an infant attached to her in a Baby Bjorn type of harness. Mr. X proceeded to attempt to grab the child by placing his hands under each of the infants' arms. The pax in XYD was in complete shock. I tried to get Mr. X to release the child. Once I did so; Mr. X continued to stay in the aisle of the aircraft when I heard the landing gear deploy. Once again; I asked Mr. X to take his seat for landing and he continued to stand in the aisle. The following happened in order: Mr. X refused to listen to our orders to sit down in his seat for landing.Mr. X became slightly combative with the female passenger seated in XXC who was trying to help. Mr. X grabbed her right wrist tightly causing discomfort and pain. Once FA in the back and I realized how close we were to the ground due to fog; we had to stay standing in the aisle to protect Mr. X. I proceeded to try and get around Mr. X to make sure I was standing in front of him to protect him from lurching forward once we touched down on the runway. FA stayed [in] the back to make sure Mr. X did not fall backwards. While going around Mr. X; he pushed his backside against me and pushed me into the passenger seated at XYC. He then yelled at me telling me I was an '[expletive]' I repeatedly told Mr. X that 'I am here for your safety!! I am here for your safety!!'FA notified the Purser of the situation once we had landed. Purser then relayed the information to the flight deck crew. Mr. X continued to walk around the back cabin and aft galley as we taxied in and FA blocked the doors preventing Mr. X from trying to open the doors while they were armed. I stood between Mr. X and the infant child seated in XYD since the mother was frightened by the earlier actions. FA and I remained with him and in the aisle until the aircraft came to a complete stop and blocked in at the gate.,,,,An Air Carrier Flight Attendant had to deal with a non-compliant passenger who suffered from dementia. He refused to obey commands to fasten his seatbelt and on final approach; stood up in the cabin and alarmed other passengers with his odd behavior. The flight attendants kept the unruly passenger from the armed exit doors until blocked in at the gate.,"The incident occurred on an Air Carrier flight during which a Flight Attendant (FA) encountered a non-compliant passenger, Mr. X, who suffered from dementia. The cause of the incident was Mr. X's refusal to fasten his seatbelt during both takeoff and landing, despite the FA's assistance in securing it. During the final approach, Mr. X unbuckled his seatbelt, stood in the aisle, and displayed erratic behavior, including attempting to grab an infant from a nearby passenger, which alarmed other passengers. The process of the incident involved the FA repeatedly attempting to assist Mr. X in complying with safety protocols. However, Mr. X became combative, grabbing a female passenger's wrist and yelling at the FA. As the aircraft approached the runway, the FA and another FA stationed in the back worked to protect Mr. X from potential injury during landing by positioning themselves strategically. Once the aircraft landed and taxied to the gate, the FAs ensured Mr. X remained in the cabin and prevented him from accessing the exit doors while they were armed. The FAs remained with Mr. X until the aircraft was secured at the gate. The result of the incident was the successful containment of Mr. X and the protection of other passengers and crew until the situation was resolved safely. No physical harm was reported, and the FAs effectively managed the situation.",disruptive

I stood up and knocked on the door and told the passenger to take her seat we were landing. She said she had to pee and she could 'do what ever she wanted.' I knocked again on the door and asked her if she was smoking in there because I could smell smoke and the smoke alarm was going off so she needed to get out right now! She said that I could not tell her what to do! The cockpit called back to inform us they had a light that said smoke in the lav and we informed him that we had a passenger that refused to go back to her seat. The landing gear was coming down and at this point I told her she better stay in there (if she came out she couldn't get to her seat without endangering the passenger in XXC) The Captain made a PA for the passenger in the lav to return to her seat immediately! She came out; cussing up a storm; and had sprayed something in the lav that she claimed was feminine hygiene spray. I repeated 'were you smoking in there?' She started waving her arms and saying 'she could do whatever the [explitive] she wanted and no one could [explitive] tell her what to do' over and over.Another Flight Attendant got her to sit down with the assistance of the passenger in XXC. I talked to the cockpit and informed them that she was now seated and her seat number. The Captain asked me to check the lav to make sure nothing was on fire and I did. She had sprayed something in there to hide the smell of smoke and it was overpowering! No cigs were found in trash can so I took my seat. There was no reason for her to spray that spray and be so defiant if she wasn't guilty! I smell cigarettes and the smoke alarm was going off. I did not smell her spray until she opened the door! She was 2 steps away from the lav the entire flight and she chose to go to the bathroom after we were seated! Police met the flight and questioned her and never came in to check the lav. This woman interfered with the duties of the flight crew; caused alarms to go off in the cockpit during sterile cockpit; told us we couldn't tell her what the [explitive] to do; and almost caused us to land standing up. She should not be allowed to fly again if she can't follow instructions and is going to carry on the way she did! Unfortunately; I believe the police let her go. They asked us if she did finally sit down; which she did...but that was not the problem; the problem was that she was smoking in lav! That is against FAA regulations; if was not just her not complying with crew member instructions...Unbelievable!,,,,An unruly passenger entered a lavatory on approach; apparently lit a cigarette and eventually set off the smoke alarm. The reporter/Flight Attendant's attempts to extricate the passenger were unsuccessful until the Captain made an announcement demanding she return to her seat. She then left the lav; which reeked with what she claimed was a feminine hygiene product; and excoriated the reporter in vulgar terms. The passenger was detained by airport police.,"The incident occurred during the approach to landing when a passenger entered the lavatory, lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke alarm and message panel. The Flight Attendant requested the passenger return to her seat, but she refused. The Captain addressed the passenger via a public announcement, prompting her to exit the lavatory, where she cursed and claimed to have used feminine hygiene spray. The Flight Attendant discovered the spray but no cigarettes, suggesting the passenger's defiance indicated guilt. The smoke alarm disrupted cockpit communication during a critical phase. The passenger was detained by police but not arrested. The Flight Attendant believes FAA regulations should be enforced against her for smoking in the lavatory and non-compliance.",disruptive

It was raining fairly hard as well; and water was blowing in the forward galley door. I was saying goodbye to the passengers. Toward the end of deplaning; a woman who looked to be in her twenties; turned right to exit the aircraft instead of following those people directly in front of her who had turned left and exited properly. I immediately caught her turning and began to say repeatedly; 'NO; NO; NO; NO!!! Ma'am please turn around and go the other way'. The passenger continued on and stepped out onto the provisioning truck; finally stopping; turning around; getting back on the aircraft; and exiting aircraft left. The passenger never said anything to me or any (company) personnel. I should have been in the galley. It is very difficult when at times there are 3 crew members; provisioning and agents all jockeying for the same galley space. Perhaps there is some sort of temporary boundary that could be placed between the galley area and aisle to help passengers avoid mistakes. Although; I'm sure this would be considered a safety hazard.,,,,While deplaning; a passenger turned right into a B737 galley and; with the Flight Attendant calling to her; out into a provisioning truck before realizing the error; turning around and exiting the main cabin door.,"The incident occurred during the deplaning process of a flight. A passenger in her twenties attempted to exit the aircraft by turning right near the forward bulkhead, deviating from the standard leftward exit path used by other passengers. The flight attendant noticed this and repeatedly instructed the passenger to turn around and exit the correct way. Despite the attendant's intervention, the passenger continued to the provisioning truck, realized her mistake, reboarded the aircraft, and exited through the proper left-side door. The passenger did not engage in communication with the flight attendant or any crew members. The flight attendant reflected on the challenges faced during deplaning, particularly the limited space and the presence of multiple individuals (crew, provisioners, and agents) in the galley area. She suggested the possibility of implementing a temporary boundary to prevent such incidents, though she acknowledged the potential safety concerns associated with this idea.",disruptive

The Captain and I were both taken off guard by this because we were in sterile cockpit. However; we felt that there may be a safety of flight issue or physical threat to the Flight Attendant. The Captain looked at me to answer to the call. When I answered the Flight Attendant sounded nervous and distressed and said that a passenger was 'being disruptive; arguing with her and is on his phone. He won't turn off his phone even though I made three announcements. Do I have time to go back again and tell him to turn it off?' I said; 'No; we are in the approach phase. Stay seated and we can make an announcement.' After the initial call we were cleared for the approach and had intercepted the localizer. The glide slope started coming down. The Captain called for 'flaps 15' and I put the flaps into position. I informed the Captain of the issue and she said to make a 'loud' announcement that all electronic devices must be turned off. I made an assertive PA. After the PA; the glide slope was still coming down to be intercepted and the Captain called 'gear down'. I put the gear down and did the pilot not flying 'flow'. The Captain called 'Flaps 20 Before Landing Checklist' and I did the respective pilot not flying duties. I asked if we needed to make sure the Flight Attendant was seated and the problem was handled because we were unsure where the passenger was and if he was a physical threat. The Captain said 'yeah; call quickly to make sure' and I used the call button to call the cabin. The Flight Attendant answered and said that the passenger was 'not listening' but did not indicate that anything else was wrong and said he was in his seat. At that time; we stopped all communication with the cabin because we did not feel that there was an immediate threat to the approach or landing the aircraft. We continued the ILS 4R approach and landed without incident. Upon landing and clearing the runway we were instructed to contact Ground. Ground gave us taxi instructions to taxi via 22R; E; to the gate. Then; per standard BOS procedure; I took Comm 2 to contact Operations and get a gate assignment and the Captain monitored Comm 1. The Captain said we should have security meet us to handle the passenger. I agreed and asked Operations to have police meet the aircraft. We completed the after landing checklist; taxied to the gate; and completed the parking checklist. Upon reaching the gate; passengers were deplaned as usual (pending a 5 minute delay while we waited for security); the Captain contacted Operations; and I spoke with the police about the matter. ATC was NOT made aware of what happened because; after our final call to the cabin; we did not feel that there was a threat to the safe operation of the aircraft. Upon completing the flight we discussed what should have been done and what actions could have been better. We agreed that we should not have answered the call because the EMER switch (indicative of an emergency) was not used. Therefore; we should have continued the flight and assessed the situation further once we had landed. In the future; I will not answer calls initiated by the cabin during sterile cockpit unless the EMER switch is used to indicate an emergency condition. Answering the call only increases workload during a time of task saturation. I will also ensure that all crew members understand communication requirements and what is expected during sterile cockpit and emergency operations.,,,,An air carrier First Officer discussed the propriety of a call from a Flight Attendant regarding a disruptive passenger during approach and landing.,"The incident occurred during an ILS 4R approach into BOS when a Flight Attendant contacted the cockpit about a disruptive passenger. The call was unexpected as the crew was in the sterile cockpit phase. The passenger was refusing to turn off his phone, prompting the Flight Attendant to seek assistance. The crew decided to address the issue by making a PA announcement, continuing the approach, and landing safely. Post-landing, they requested security to handle the passenger. The crew later reflected that answering the call during sterile cockpit may have been unnecessary, leading to a decision to improve communication protocols to avoid similar distractions in the future.",disruptive

She then advised the gate agent 'the mechanic said no; it is not OK to board'.After I finished my conversation with Maintenance Control; I went back to the cockpit to inform the Captain.
