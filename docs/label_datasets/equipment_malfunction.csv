Ultimately; I failed to notify either Operations in ZZZ or the Captain. Upon reflection during the flight and; as not to create an 'issue;' I realized that I had failed to handle the situation correctly. In an effort to not continue the risk; upon arrival in ZZZ1; I spoke with the Operations Agent and explained the situation and asked if it could be corrected. The Operations Agent indicated to me that the passenger's bags would be pulled prior to their connecting flight. I then spoke to the passenger(s) and asked them to speak with the Operations Agent. Self-realization that each of us is critically responsible for the safety of our crew; our passengers and our assets. That it is not an issue to stop what is currently happening and address it at the time. To hope that if you do make an error that by handling it at the time; that you will not be perceived differently by the crew. Is it possible that checked baggage be screened for items such as lithium batteries; thereby reducing the factor of human error?,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported failing to notify the appropriate parties before departure after learning about a passenger's checked bag that may have potentially contained lithium batteries. After arriving; the reporter notified an Operations Agent to deal with the bag's contents.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who was informed by a passenger that their checked luggage contained an electric razor and a camera, potentially housing lithium batteries. The attendant initially failed to notify Operations or the Captain, possibly due to uncertainty about the items. Upon realizing the oversight, the attendant informed an Operations Agent upon arrival, leading to the passenger's bags being pulled before their connecting flight. The attendant reflected on the importance of safety and suggested enhancing procedures to reduce human error through better screening of checked baggage for lithium batteries.",equipment malfunction

That we will be landing in 20 minutes; but he's going to circle to get rid of some fuel and hear back from Tower on what to do next. He will call back shortly with an update; for Person A and I to remain seated until he calls back to give us further instructions and information. We complete our procedure and hang up. Person A then calls me and we synchronize our watches and talk about what we plan on doing once the Captain calls back with further instructions. By this time it's XA51; 14 minutes left before we land. Around XA58; Captain comes on the PA and informs passengers of the situation. States we're heading back to ZZZ; due to nose gear issue; but it will be a normal landing. XA59; Captain calls to Person A and myself; repeats normal landing; all gears are down; including the nose gear; all lights show green; we should now be landing in 10 minutes. We repeat procedure; Person A ask Captain is it okay to make our announcements now; he states 'Yes' and set clocks now to 9 minutes; which is XB01. Person A does the announcement; we do compliance check and walk through. After accessing outside; we noticed we still had time and we made the before landing announcement. Did another compliance check; after that we took our seats. By that time it was XB10; landed at XB20. Normal landing as stated by the Captain; arrived to gate; and then deplane.

The captain informed the flight attendants, Person A and the narrator, of the issue and stated that they would circle to burn fuel and wait for further instructions from air traffic control. The attendants followed procedures, synchronized their watches, and prepared for further updates. After 14 minutes, the captain addressed the passengers, confirming the return to the original destination for a normal landing. Ten minutes later, the captain called the attendants to confirm that all gears, including the nose gear, were down and functioning properly, allowing for a safe landing. The attendants completed their pre-landing checks, made announcements, and ensured passenger safety. The plane landed as scheduled,Taxiied to the gate, and passengers were deplaned.

I then noticed fire trucks beside us. I had no idea about anything happening until the flight deck door opened and then I heard some things...I was then told that we had a pressure issue and we had [requested priority handling].

Between ZZZ1 and ZZZZZ Captain did a normal system monitor check. Upon looking at the COND page; he noticed the AFT Cargo Temp at 180 degrees (Steady Green); asked me if I had seen a temp that high; I replied No! We kept an eye on it; over the next 10 minutes; noticed it rising to 188 degrees; then 194 degrees (still Steady Green) where it stayed for the duration of the flight. This made us uncomfortable for normal Cargo Bay temperatures in my 3;000+ hours flying this aircraft at 2 different airlines have never exceeded cabin temperatures during cruise. We simultaneously started looking into what could be a catastrophic problem. I got into the QRH AOM/FOM/and other manuals to look for temperature limitations and fixes. I found none; anywhere. During the same time; Captain got on the Phone with Operations and phone patched to Maintenance Control; where they attempted multiple resets to no success. When Captain got off the phone with Maintenance; he said; 'Well nothing fixed It; and they (Maintenance) said we are on our own.'At that point; we agreed as a crew that we didn't know what was going on down there. We were both not comfortable taking an aircraft with this indication over water; with limited divert options to an international location; and with no company or Contract Maintenance at the destination not knowing what was going on down there. The indication was steady at this point; not rising higher [than] 194 degrees; nor giving any other indications to the back when we notified the Flight Attendants and told them what was going on. At this point; we felt we were not in a land as soon as possible scenario; but in a land as soon as practical scenario but keeping land as soon as possible options available and we decided to divert to ZZZ2. We gave ATC a PAN PAN call since we were going to a divert airport that wasn't our alternate but that we were not at the time an emergency aircraft; we just wanted to have all our bases covered. We notified Dispatch both via phone patch and ACARS. During descent we were cleared the ZZZZZ Arrival to ZZZ2.We were still grossly overweight with a lot of gas; so we referenced the overweight Checklist. With that; we decided that with the condition still not worsening from what had been continuously indicated with no secondary indications or issues coming from the cabin; Captain and I both agreed that in an effort not to compound the problem we should hold to burn down gas; but having immediate [landing] options nearby; so we held at ZZZZZ1 at 16;000 ft. for 30-40 min and got to a calculated weight that would put us on deck in ZZZ2 right at Max landing weight. We continued to ZZZ2 via the arrival; for an uneventful Runway XX landing. On a side note; the XX transition from the ZZZZZ Arrival is a bit of a slam dunk. We asked for a bit longer final to get down; stabilized; and situated; and ATC approach gave us a few last second altitude; headings; and speed amendments through final which started to task saturate us as we prepared for landing. For example: open descent from 6;000-3;000; we were told to amend altitude and maintain 4;000 ft. while passing 4;200 feet; thrust idle; and speed brakes out. We blew through the altitude and had to climb back up Auto Pilot off; ALT horn blaring; and engines spooling up to 80+%; and getting speed brakes back in. We were also given several headings through final; and were asked to slow to final approach speed 10 plus miles outside the final approach fix at 4;000 feet; and approach didn't give us an approach clearance until we had flown through the glide slope on the localizer; and had to join from above; in order to sequence aircraft landing [Runway] XYL; which started to compound our landing configuration planning; and a go around was not something we were hoping to do; especially off of a PAN PAN call. We later found that on a couple of occurrences; ATC did not pass the PANPAN or divert info from Center to Center to Approach. We were later reassigned upon arrival to fly a ZZZ3 Turn that left in 5 minutes.I told Company that we just went through a lot; and that if they wanted us to fly that turn; that I needed a break for an amount of time that I was setting; some food; and so the Captain and I went and had a sit down meal; decompressed; talked about what had happened; after an hour or so I assessed my fitness for duty and felt I was good to fly the turn. The Captain and I were sitting on the jet; and when we called for push going to ZZZ3; Ramp told us to hold and that Maintenance wanted to talk to us. The maintenance team member got on the radio; asked if we were the crew that brought Aircraft X in from ZZZ; I replied yes; and he told us we needed to fill out a fume report. Captain asked what he was talking about; and told him this was the first we have heard about any fume incident. The Maintainer on the radio said the Flight Attendants had filed a fume report after the flight; and we needed to do the same. The Flight Attendants never told us anything about fumes nor their intent to fill out any such reports. Captain then filed a fume report said he had no information to give for we knew nothing about it. I felt Captain had communicated very clearly what was going on to the flight attendants about the situation; and our intent to divert. They had never communicated any such issues during any duration of or after the flight. Unknown from the high temperature in the Aft Cargo Bay. We did later saw that Maintenance replaced the sensor in the aft cargo bay via the app. We were curious that with all the ZZZ team members in Training vests if maybe they stacked the bags in the aft cargo bay above the line and possibly covered the sensor or did something to It. However; As far as the 'suspected' fume event; there was no communication from the flight attendants to the cockpit crew for this event. We noticed via the app that Maintenance later deferred the APU to prevent 'further fume events' due to the suspected fume event we were later notified about from ZZZ2 Maintenance. Not sure why if there is a fume event (or even a suspected fume event) why they don't further investigate the problem or fix the problem; rather than just pencil whip it into deferment. If there was any fumes in this situation; how would MX (Maintenance) know they came from the APU and not from any potential problem we were encountering? Put quick reference limitations on a Cockpit Card or in the QRH or checklist to quickly reference for situations such as these. I felt like we were on an Easter egg hunt for something that we later found wasn't there which wasted a lot of our decision making time. I know that Airbus FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) and other manufacture manuals/reference material has such limitations for quick reference from my experience at a previous Airbus airline. Why can't the company get on board with Airbus??? Make sure Flight Attendants communicate to the cockpit if they were smelling fumes.,,,,A321 First Officer reported an abnormally elevated Aft Cargo Bay temperature during cruise. After conferring with maintenance; the flight executed a precautionary diversion for maintenance.,"The incident involved an A321 flight crew (Party 1) and a flight attendant (Party 2). During the flight, the crew noticed an abnormally high aft cargo bay temperature (194 degrees), which was above standard operating parameters. The crew consulted manuals and contacted maintenance but found no immediate solution. Concerned about the situation, particularly over water with limited diversion options, the crew decided to divert to ZZZ2. They made a PAN PAN call to inform ATC and contacted dispatch. During descent and landing at ZZZ2, the crew encountered challenges with overweight landing conditions and ATC communication, but the landing was uneventful. Post-landing, maintenance informed the crew that a fume report had been filed by the flight attendants, though the crew had no prior knowledge of fumes or related issues during the flight. Maintenance deferred the APU to prevent further fume events. The crew expressed concerns about the lack of communication from the flight attendants regarding the suspected fume event and questioned the adequacy of maintenance's response. They recommended improved communication protocols between the cockpit and cabin crew, better access to quick reference materials for such situations, and a more thorough investigation of potential issues instead of deferred fixes.",equipment malfunction

They catered the front next. Upon completing catering; and when the R1 door was closed; I noticed that the warning strap was across the window. I immediately called it out and said 'why is that strap across the window'? The door was obviously disarmed as there was no slide deployment. D Flight Attendant was with me. The CSA (Customer Service Associate); who was waiting at the R1 door; then said 'you gave the caters a thumbs up when they knocked and the strapped was attached' which I do not recall doing. D Flight Attendant didn't see the warning strap in the armed position when she boarded the plane either. I immediately moved the warning strap to the disarmed position and noticed that the velcro strap on the extension piece was worn out to the point where the extension would not stay attached. It constantly fell down and hung.I told the First Officer as she was leaving the flight deck that we had an issue with the R1 warning strap. She indicated that they were about to time out and discounted my comment. I made her look at the strap. She came to the door and said 'no; it works; see'. I showed her that 4/5 attempts to place the strap on the Velcro didn't work; it would fall down. She said 'well you gotta talk to the Captain about it' and then entered the bathroom. I then proceeded to talk to the Captain. He stopped me before I even started and said 'if you tell me anything I am obligated to put it in the book; so is this really important?' I said yes; I have an issue with the warning strap. He also indicated that they had a timing issue and couldn't take any delays. I told them that I needed Maintenance. Maintenance came and fixed the strap. I don't know what happened with the strap being across the window in the armed position. I can only speculate that catering attached it while it was hanging down. If it was in place; they shouldn't have opened the door; the CSA should have also said something as she was waiting by L1; apparently watching; and the entire inbound crew should have checked upon deplaning. I find it odd that all of these checks would have been missed. Furthermore; I didn't appreciate being put in a position where I had to make the call if we were going to take a potential delay and possibly cancel the flight due to a timing out issue. My only job is to bring cabin discrepancies to the captain's attention. This was a poor example of CRM. This morning; I had a conversation with the Captain regarding the events yesterday and reiterated what I have written in this [report]; about poor CRM and putting me in an uncomfortable situation. He agreed and said they handled the situation poorly. As we are flying together today on an ETOPS flight to ZZZ; I didn't want to there be any communication issue before we left. Our conversation was pleasant and we cleared the air.,,,,Flight attendant reported a CRM issue developed with the flight deck crew after reporting there was a minor maintenance issue with an aircraft door.,"The incident arose from a maintenance issue with the R1 door warning strap, which the Flight Attendant noticed during cleaning. She reported the strap was improperly positioned and highlighted worn Velcro causing instability. Despite the First Officer and Captain dismissing her concerns initially, the Flight Attendant persisted, leading to Maintenance being called, who subsequently repaired the strap. The situation highlighted shortcomings in CRM, prompting a later discussion between the Flight Attendant and Captain, resulting in a commitment to improve communication and address such issues more effectively.",equipment malfunction

One; if the crew never left the gate when they encountered a power distribution irregularity when switching from ground to APU power. Two; if Line Control had a Jetway Operator standing by at the gate. And three; if there was a better and clearer communication between the maintenance crew.I received a gate call on the radio; that Aircraft X was coming back to the gate; due to a 'Warn Elec' message on EICAS. I was informed by Line Control that Aircraft X was returning to the gate and was asked if I needed the jetway to be pulled up. I replied 'Yes I will need the jetway pulled up'. Myself and two mechanics that were assigned to Aircraft X; headed out to the gate. As we approached the gate; the ground crew were getting ready to greet the aircraft; no Jetway Operator. At this time I made a second request to Line Control; for a Jetway Operator. The aircraft arrives; the ground crew guide the plane in. One Mechanic jumps on the headset; the other climbs in to the E compartment to reset circuit breakers.I was thumbing through the iPad; looking for possible causes in the AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) and FIM (Fault Isolation Manual) procedures. Maintenance was ready to go. Still no Jetway. At this time I decided not to wait any longer and go through the hatch of the plane and get onboard. I pointed upstairs to the Mechanic on the headset. I got his attention a second time and mouthed 'upstairs' and pointed upwards again. He nodded. As I am climbing in the E compartment; I got the other Mechanic's attention. He had told me that he reset circuit breakers and that I should see if the message cleared. I agreed.I banged on the hatch before opening it; then proceeded to crack it open. I saw light; looked clear to open. Heard a yell; then a foot come through; hitting me on the head; face; then right shoulder. I reacted by catching a foot with a black shoe and proceeded to hoist the foot to safety; by placing it in the galley on solid ground. I got out and I saw an elderly gentleman; a Flight Attendant; sobbing from pain sitting down. At this point I headed into the cockpit and I started pushing buttons to clear the message. No help. The First Officer and the Observer were explaining the problem they encountered before leaving the gate initially. The Captain was more concerned with the Flight Attendant; than getting this plane out. He took his time and explained to the passengers in great detail of the happenings that occurred. He should have just assured the passengers that matters would be solved quickly and swiftly; instead of shining the light on us maintenance. He was very rude and never once did anyone ask me if I was okay.Now; people are starting to show up. Port Authority police; some safety members from our maintenance department; one other mechanic. Through this bad ordeal; I am disappointed as to treatment that I was subjected to by the Port Authority police; the Captain and one female flight attendant; who felt that her opinion mattered more than the professionalism required to maintain in front of our customers. It never ceases to amaze me on how insignificant we as mechanics are made to feel by other departments here at [Company]. I thought we were all on the same team!,,,,Mechanic reported that a Flight Attendant was injured when he accidentally stepped through an open floor hatch.,"The incident occurred when a maintenance crew responded to a 'Warn Elec' message on an aircraft, leading them to attempt resetting circuit breakers. Due to a delay in obtaining a jetway operator, the maintenance team proceeded without one, resulting in a mechanic entering the aircraft through an open hatch. During this process, a flight attendant accidentally stepped through the hatch, causing injuries to both the flight attendant and the mechanic. The Captain's management of the situation and subsequent interaction with the maintenance crew were perceived as disrespectful, highlighting a need for improved interdepartmental communication and support systems. Proposed solutions include ensuring a jetway operator is available and enhancing communication protocols to prevent such incidents. The outcome underscores the importance of teamwork and respect in addressing technical issues efficiently.",equipment malfunction

That's why It's on the plane because they wouldn't let it go below and I said OK. He said he does it all the time.I then went up and asked the Customer Service Representative to come back and look at it if they had checked it out and she also had a lead on board neither one of them ever answered my questions. Did someone approve this item?I went and talk to the Captain because I was concerned this large box was half the size of the bin with lithium batteries in it and I know that it would not fit in the battery containment bag. We were flying 5 hours over water.I talked to the Captain and he said there were cell phones and laptops on Board with Lithium batteries in them and I said but this box would not fit in our battery containment bag they would. He then said he thought it was OK; so the guest brought his large bag in the overhead bin. I would like to know if this item is approved?We should have checked this item out further before flying.,,,,B737-900 Flight Attendant reported concerns regarding transport of large Lithium Ion battery powered device in cabin overhead without thorough research.,"During a B737-900 flight, a Flight Attendant discovered a large hard-covered box in the overhead bin, which a passenger identified as a drum set containing a lithium battery. The attendant expressed concerns about the item's size, its inability to fit into a battery containment bag, and the presence of lithium batteries, particularly since the flight was scheduled to operate over water for five hours. The attendant sought clarification from the Customer Service Representative (CSR) and the Captain regarding the item's approval but did not receive satisfactory answers. The Captain acknowledged the presence of other lithium battery-powered devices on board, such as cell phones and laptops, but deemed the drum set acceptable. The attendant raised questions about the lack of thorough research into the item and proposed that such items should be checked more carefully before departure. The incident highlights concerns about lithium battery safety and the need for proper review procedures.",equipment malfunction

The crew was; at that moment not aware of any inoperative chiller on the aircraft. During the briefing with the Captain; and after checking the list of maintenance issues in my link; there was no mention about an inoperative chiller. The two carrier boxes posed a significant tripping hazard to our customers boarding; but the catering representative refused to remove the carrier boxes; stating that the flight attendants should take them on board. The carrier boxed where too heavy to lift; and it is my understanding that we should not carry heave carrier boxes full of dangerous goods through an aircraft with customers on board. An In-flight Supervisor was in the area and was unhelpful in resolving this dangerous situation. While I was trying to have these carrier boxes with dry ice removed; this Supervisor displayed aggressive behavior and stating if I was refusing the dry ice and taking a delay. He was unwilling to listen or understand the problem with having two carrier boxes full of dry ice being placed in front of the boarding door while customers were boarding. At this point I was informed by the Captain that chiller number 7 in the aft galley had an issue and the fuse was pulled. No one informed the crew about this. In the interest of departing on time; and to satisfy the Supervisor who was getting more hostile by the minute; I decided to accept two bins of dry ice; that I hand carried on the aircraft myself. We then were able to close to boarding door and leave on time.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that a communication breakdown resulted in dry ice being brought onboard the aircraft without proper documentation.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between a flight attendant and a catering representative regarding the placement of two carrier boxes filled with dry ice in front of the boarding door. The flight attendant was not initially informed about an inoperative chiller, which the catering representative cited as the reason for leaving the boxes on the ground. The boxes posed a tripping hazard to passengers boarding the aircraft, but the catering representative refused to remove them, insisting the flight attendant take them on board. The boxes were too heavy for the crew to lift safely, and an In-Flight Supervisor present in the area was unhelpful and displayed aggressive behavior when the flight attendant attempted to resolve the issue. During the conflict, the Captain informed the crew that chiller number 7 in the aft galley had an issue, but the crew had not been previously notified. To de-escalate the situation and avoid further delays, the flight attendant decided to take the two bins of dry ice herself, carrying them onto the aircraft. This allowed the boarding door to close and the flight to depart on time.",equipment malfunction

It was not until [we] looked out the service window; that they were able to notice the street lights coming into view. That was when the landing gear was [extending]. Both FA's (Flight Attendants) rushed through the cabin to try to assist passengers and secure the cabin. As FWD FA walked back to the galley; the momentum pushed her into a jog and she yelled at the AFT FA; 'Get down.' [AFT FA] was able to make it to her jump seat safely and secure herself. This momentum caused [another FA] to run into the flight deck door; hit her head and bounced off. Due to the stress of the situation; neither flight attendants were fully able to secure the cabin or galley before landing. FO (First Officer) said that he did do the chime but there was a system malfunction. Captain wrote up the plane after jet bridge was extended.,,,,CRJ900 Flight Attendant reported that the cabin crew was not alerted to final descent.,"The incident occurred on a CRJ900 flight when the final descent chime, intended to alert the cabin crew, malfunctioned and did not sound. As a result, the flight attendants were not promptly informed of the aircraft's preparation for landing. Approximately 20 minutes before landing, the initial descent announcement was made, and the flight attendants began securing the galley and performing last-minute tasks. However, the absence of the final descent chime caused them to remain unaware of the impending landing until they noticed street lights outside the aircraft, indicating that the landing gear was being extended. In response, the flight attendants rushed to secure the cabin and assist passengers. During this rush, the forward flight attendant was pushed into a jog and yelled for the aft attendant to ""Get down."" The aft attendant safely reached her jump seat, while another flight attendant collided with the flight deck door, sustaining a head injury. Due to the sudden and stressful situation, neither attendant was able to fully secure the cabin or galley before landing. The first officer reported that he had activated the chime but faced a system malfunction. The captain subsequently filed an incident report post-landing. This incident highlights the importance of reliable communication systems in ensuring passenger and crew safety during critical phases of flight.",equipment malfunction

Captain insisted they could still fly without it. His alternate protocol was to open the flight deck door during takeoff and landing. Flight Attendant X was very uncomfortable with this and was saying it is against what her manual says. She was peer pressured and guilted by the Captain into operating all four flights with the flight deck door open. The company has taken on more contracts than they can handle with their fleet and amount of crew members. Aircraft have fallen into disrepair; and those who complain about it are punished; those who operate flights illegally get more money in their pockets. This Captain is notorious for flying any aircraft and allowing crew scheduling to manipulate his hours so that he can work more than what is legal for a big chunk of money. I contacted manager of inflight; Chief Pilot; Director of Operations; and Director of Safety prior to flying this morning. I showed them that the manual says 'an aircraft cannot depart if the interphone system between flight deck and cabin is inoperative.' I contacted another Captain who showed me that even on the MEL list; at least 50 percent of cabin interphones must be able to reach flight deck. None of ours did. I only received a reply from our Director of Operations saying that 'In certain circumstances it can be done.' He then stated he did not find it safe for a Captain to take off and land with the flight deck door open. However this Captain will never receive any questioning about his protocol because the company is just relieved the flights operated.,,,,Flight Attendant reported aircraft interphone was inoperative and the Captain continued the operation with flight deck door open.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and a Flight Captain regarding the operation of a flight with an inoperative interphone system. The Flight Attendant reported that the interphone system, which is a critical communication link between the flight deck and cabin, was not functioning. According to the aircraft manual, the aircraft should not depart if the interphone system is inoperative. However, the Captain insisted that the flight could proceed by opening the flight deck door during takeoff and landing as an alternative protocol. The Flight Attendant expressed discomfort with this approach, as it contradicted the manual, but was reportedly pressured and guilted by the Captain into complying with the protocol for four consecutive flights. The incident highlights issues within the company, including overloading its fleet and crew capacity, aircraft disrepair, and a culture where those who raise concerns about safety are punished, while those who operate flights illegally are rewarded financially. The Flight Attendant had previously raised concerns with multiple senior management personnel, including the Director of Operations, who acknowledged the potential safety risk but did not take definitive action to prevent the flight. The Captain, known for maximizing his flying hours and earnings, was not held accountable for his protocol, despite the risks involved. In summary, the incident reflects systemic management and safety concerns within the organization, including disregard for safety protocols, crew well-being, and regulatory compliance. A potential solution proposed was to review the manual's requirements, assess the Captain's flight hours, and investigate the interphone system's compliance with the MEL (Minimum Equipment List).",equipment malfunction

So; I wrote up aft cargo door L/H blowout panel and FWD LAV upper track guide screw which was broken in half. Maintenance arrived and began to thoughtfully address the issues. I was informed by a Line Mechanic that the blow out panel was missing 3 of 4 fasteners and they were checking on if they had another panel in stock. Shortly after that; a Maintenance Foreman or Supervisor showed up and said we're all good; everything is being signed off. I didn't see the new part arrive; so I asked the Foreman if they had brought and installed a new panel. He said; 'Yes; we installed the new panel and you're good to go.' When I later spoke with the Line Mechanic who actually did the work; he said they had not installed a new part; but had just taped in the old one. So; I found the Foreman and explained to him what was wrong with the old panel (3 missing fasteners) and that reinstalling it wasn't solving the problem. At that point; his story changed and he said they had found the fasteners in the cargo bay and reinstalled them into the panel before taping it up; so once again we are good to go! Then; he left. The remaining line mechanics were completing the paper work for the LAV door repair when I told the one who had done the work in the cargo how fortunate it was that they had found the 3 missing panel fasteners to which he looked befuddled and told me they hadn't found or installed any new fasteners; just taped in the old panel. He said that was why he refused to do the sign off on that job... so the Foreman signed it off. I called Maintenance Control and asked for Maintenance to reinspect the panel and was told they would do so and then 'rub your belly'. When Maintenance arrived to reinspect the panel; I was present when he removed the tape and panel which was still missing 3 of its 4 required ball-bearing fasteners. A new panel was ordered and another write-up was requested; which I did. During the delay; passengers were receiving regular updates and provided a water service. I had also tried to arrange regress to those who wanted off to reset the ground delay clock; but the Station refused to allow only a few off - it had to be all or nothing. When the new panel was ordered I deplaned all of the passengers. The part arrived and was installed fairly quickly; so we re-boarded and were preparing to depart when someone attempted to use the forward LAV and the door fell off its upper track again. We found the upper track screw on the floor and it was the exact same dirty one that was broke in half prior to the first repair. For some unknown reason; the broken screw (bolt) was reinstalled on the LAV door; so I wrote it up again. Maintenance came out and determined a new part or whole new door would be required which they said would take at least an hour; so we deplaned all of the passengers a second time. After the new LAV door was installed; it did not fit well and was scraping metal on metal across the top of the door; making the door hard to open and close; so I asked them to adjust it. They tried; but in the end; said it was as good as it was going to get. The door did open and close just not easily which in my opinion; will probably lead to another upper track screw failure; but it was signed off; so we boarded and finally completed the flight after a 4 hour and 16 minute delay. There is no doubt in my mind that the Maintenance Foreman lied directly to my face multiple times regarding maintenance that was supposedly performed; that is not acceptable. It was an unsafe act that could have been the first link in the chain of an accident/incident had I not intervened. By trying to save an hour delay; he caused a 4+ hour delay. I was told that this push; push; push; go; go; go; get it out by whatever means possible pressure was common place for that Foreman. I am concerned that his concept of risk management allowed him to reinstall a known defective piece of safety equipment (the pressurization blowout panel); sign it off; and lie about it to the Captain. Do maintenance correct the first time. Don't falsify maintenance signoffs and don't lie to crew members about the condition of their aircraft.,,,,CRJ-900 Captain reported the aircraft was refused because the corrective action taken and explanation by Maintenance was unacceptable.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and Maintenance personnel regarding the resolution of aircraft maintenance issues on a CRJ-900 aircraft. The Flight Attendant reported two problems during boarding: a protruding aft cargo L/H blowout panel and a broken upper track guide screw on the forward lav door. Maintenance was summoned, and a Line Mechanic noted that the blowout panel was missing three of four fasteners. A Foreman arrived and assured the Flight Attendant that the issues had been resolved, claiming a new panel had been installed and signed off. However, the Flight Attendant later discovered that the old panel had only been taped in place without the missing fasteners. The Foreman's story changed, claiming the fasteners had been found and reinstalled, but this was contradicted by the Line Mechanic, who admitted no new fasteners had been installed. The Flight Attendant raised concerns, leading to a reinspection by Maintenance, which confirmed the panel was still missing fasteners. A new panel was ordered, and passengers were deplaned and reboarded multiple times due to delays. Despite the replacement, the forward lav door again failed during the flight, with the broken screw reinstalled. Maintenance ultimately installed a new door, but it did not fit properly, causing metal-on-metal contact and difficulty in operation. The Flight Attendant expressed strong concerns about the Foreman's dishonesty and unsafe practices, which could have led to a potential accident. The incident resulted in a 4-hour and 16-minute delay. The Flight Attendant emphasized the need for accurate maintenance signoffs, honesty, and thoroughness to prevent such incidents in the future. The aircraft was eventually cleared for flight after the issues were addressed.",equipment malfunction

When the flight deck shuts down the aircraft while we are still deplaning passengers and leaves for their layover; it leaves the cabin crew in an unsafe position due to the inability for us to use the cabin inter phone or PA in the event of any type of emergency in the aft section of the aircraft. In essence; we have no way to communicate with the front of the aircraft other than use of the megaphone. In addition; the cabin temperature rises rapidly once the air flow is discontinued making it a health/safety issue for the 100 or more passengers still waiting to deplane.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft was shut down; on multiple occasions; prior to deplaning all the passengers.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant (Party1) and the Flight Crew/Ground Personnel (Party2) regarding the shutdown of a B737 aircraft during layovers. The Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft was shut down on multiple occasions before all passengers had deplaned, resulting in the cabin crew losing communication capabilities (interphone and PA systems), leaving them reliant on a megaphone. Additionally, the cabin temperature rose rapidly due to the cessation of airflow, posing a health and safety risk to passengers still on board. The Flight Attendant suggested that the aircraft should not be shut down until all passengers have deplaned to address these safety concerns.",equipment malfunction

FA (Flight Attendant) X was not in compliance the first day of work. [She] was eating out of first class basket before anyone was served; not briefing the exit row before main cabin door was closed and texting once she finished her service. The second day; FA X was working first class. When we arrived in ZZZ with almost a four hours and a half sit; I arrived in the crew lounge and was watching TV. FA X came in shortly after me [while] I was watching TV and texting. I look up and FA X pulls the plug from the TV and I said to FA X why are you behaving like this?FA X said you are not watching TV and I said I was and did not appreciate her behavior and she said she would do again if I turn the TV back on and she did for a second time. This time ripped it out of the wall and I said to FA X you are being disrespectful and to not do that again. She left the room; came back at the same time another crew member came in the room. She had her phone so loud. FA Y said would you please turn your phone down. She said that the volume was on the lowest setting for her phone. FA Y offered FA X headphones. She said they would not work on her phone. The show FA X was watching was using profanity every other word and it was very loud. Any crew member who walked in immediately walked out and sat outside the crew room. FA Y and myself left the room. We both felt very uncomfortable with FA X's behavior. The crew room is supposed to be a place to rest and relax. I did not feel comfortable with FA X's behavior [and] called my manager and explained what had happened and to see if once we arrived [at our destination;] if another FA could take her place. The manager said I know you have high expectations and informed me this was a CRM [issue] and we needed to work things out. Requested at some point to send an email in regards to what happened. When we arrived in ZZZ1; it was late and I was very tired and had an early report the next day. Did not have time to do a report in regards to the CRM. Following our ZZZ sit; I arrived to the aircraft for our next trip to ZZZ1; FA X said we needed to make it through these next 2 days. She was not sure what came over her in the crew room. I agreed with FA X let's work together. We performed our safety demo and part of the demo was to wear the life vest and performed how to wear the vest. FA X would only hold the vest during our demo. After our demo; I mentioned she needs to wear it versus holding it. On the third day of our first leg; FA X was leaving bins half open and the closet door open. This happened more than 8 times and had requested to please make sure they are closed and locked. She would just look at me and walked away. The service cart was left unattended at the exit row. FA X left her service cart and walk to the front galley and called the flight deck. I saw the cart sitting in the aisle at row 12. We did have turbulence on and off during the flight. I walk back to the cart and checked with passengers for service. She was requesting [that] a passenger wanted to purchase Pringles. Prior to FA X making the call to the flight deck; FA X had touched the FA call button twice in a row and I held my index finger to say give me a minute with okay I will be there. I was in the middle of my service with first class.I was not comfortable and felt the safety on the aircraft for the passengers and myself was not safe and FA X would not comply with the safety of the aircraft. I had requested for a manager to meet the aircraft once we arrived at our destination due to the situation through ACARS.I was not sure what the reason was for her calling the flight deck. I spoke to the flight deck in regards to problems of safety in flight. FA X called the flight deck and said I was ignoring her and not helping her on requested items. I explained as before; I was serving first class and [I] would be there shortly. I said to the CA (Captain) [that]there was a communication problem and FA X was leaving bins opened and unlocked service cart left in the aisle at row 12. FA X walked up to [the] galley to call the flight deck and left the cart in the aisle. I requested the flight deck to please notify ACARS there was an issue with safety on board and FA X was not keeping the bins closed and locked; left her cart at the exit row and not talking to me. After FA X's service in the main cabin; she began texting on her phone for the remainder of the flight and would not respond to me.On arrival; two regional managers came to the aircraft to talk and discuss the issues. I had explained to FA X; once all passengers had left the aircraft; a manager would be coming to talk with us in regards to our flight. Before I could address the reason for the call; FA X started the conversation in regards to the incident in ZZZ crew room and made false accusations in regards to what happened to the point of making up things that did not occur. The main reason for the meeting was to discuss the safety issues. I explained the issues of FA X not listening to my request to please lock and close all bins and several occasions to please close the closet door after she opened it to remove an item. The manager asked if we both could work this flight together if not; and you choose not to; you will have a missed trip and a meeting with a manager. FA X said she was okay and I said I had a problem flying with FA X from inflight safety as well making false accusations that did not occur.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that the work environment was very stressful due to the cabin crew pairing.,"The incident involved two flight attendants, FA X and FA Y, on a flight operated by an air carrier. FA Y reported that the work environment became increasingly stressful due to FA X's non-compliant and disrespectful behavior. On the first day, FA X violated protocols by eating from the first-class basket before service, failing to brief the exit row, and texting after completing her duties. The following day, during a layover, FA X disrupted the crew lounge by unplugging the TV, leading to a confrontation. FA X's behavior in the crew room was deemed disrespectful and uncomfortable by other crew members, prompting FA Y to contact management and request a replacement. Despite management's suggestion to resolve the CRM issues, FA Y did not file a report due to fatigue. Subsequent days saw continued non-compliance from FA X, including failing to secure bins, leaving the service cart unattended, and making disruptive calls to the flight deck. During turbulence, FA X was observed texting and ignoring safety protocols, leading FA Y to inform the flight deck about safety concerns. Upon arrival, managers met with the crew, where FA X made false accusations. The managers facilitated a discussion, with both agreeing to continue working together, though FA Y expressed ongoing concerns about safety and false allegations. In summary, the incident stemmed from FA X's repeated non-compliance and disrespectful behavior, leading to a CRM breakdown. Management介入 aimed to address the issues, but FA Y's concerns about safety and accuracy highlighted the need for continued attention.",equipment malfunction

I directed the flight deck crew to don oxygen masks and set the regulators to 100 percent and established crew communication. I then [advised] ATC and asked for direct [destination]. Shortly thereafter; the Flight Attendants notified us that the device and its spare batteries (which were also in a state of thermal runaway) were contained in the ion battery emergency containment bag and there was no smoke.The device was apparently an e-cigarette. As the device was contained and there was no smoke; I elected to discontinue the QRH. However; the flight deck crew remained on oxygen for the duration of the approach and landing. Approach and landing were uneventful. My biggest concern is that after attempting to notify the Flight Attendants that we were on oxygen; I never called them back. They were making announcements on my first attempt and I simply dropped calling them back off my to-do list. They were surprised when we landed and were surrounded by Fire Rescue.Distraction management continues to be an issue for all flight crews. As a Check Airman; I should have done a better job of communicating. Better use of all my resources would have kept this from happening.

He complained over and over that he was having pain; but continued to refuse medical assistance. He said he was writing an email to my airline and was going to sue. I noticed that he was consuming alcohol and appeared to be inebriated. His eyes were red and his speech slurry.He had previously told me that he didn't have a card to pay for drinks only cash. He then said that he had paid some passenger to use their cards for his drinks. I slowed down his drinking explaining that we needed to monitor his possible medical situation. He became increasingly agitated and repetitive despite me trying to de-escalate the situation. He was following me around and came into the galley to video me. When I said that wasn't allowed he pushed me on the shoulder. I went up to the purser and we called a level one. That was the end of my contact with him.,,,,A Flight Attendant reported an inebriated passenger claimed to have been shocked by exposed passenger service unit wires; but refused medical attention and became increasingly agitated and aggressive.,"The incident began when an intoxicated passenger reported being shocked by exposed wires in the PSU of his armrest. Despite the flight attendant's offer of medical assistance, the passenger refused help and became agitated. He mentioned suing the airline and was observed consuming alcohol, appearing inebriated. The attendant moved him to another seat and taped the PSU. As the passenger's behavior escalated, including following the attendant and attempting to video her in the galley, he pushed her when she制止ed him. The attendant then alerted the purser, leading to a level one response, which concluded their interaction. The solution involved crew intervention to manage the situation.",equipment malfunction

My first officer and I also discussed the likely possibility of a fuel spill somewhere near us on the ramp. In my experience on the MD-80 it is not uncommon to get a faint; exhaust like fume smell in the air conditioning system; and thick condensation during hot; muggy summer nights such as this one was in ZZZ. I assume the smell was stronger in the cabin than in the cockpit since both the FO and I had our air vents closed. The flight attendants requested that I make a PA stating that everything was ok and there was no cause for alarm and we are aware of the condensation and smell; which I did. The two forward flight attendants also informed me that 'they opened the doors in back' which I thought meant that the two rear flight attendants had opened the rear aircraft doors for ventilation. Our number three and one FAs; meant to inform me that passengers were exiting through the over wing exits. This was a simple misunderstanding that was caused by task saturation in the cockpit; monitoring the APU indications; and determining the cause of the smell. I was later informed that passengers took it upon themselves to open all four over wing exits and exit onto the wing. I was told that it was estimated that 15-20 people were on each wing at one point. Our number two flight attendant vocally told passengers to stop exiting through the over wing exits. The FA had no chance to prevent passengers from initiating the uncommanded evacuation given the crowded aisle and interior that is typical of everyone standing when the seat belt sign is turned off. Our number four flight attendant made a PA instructing passengers to stop and to not evacuate or exit though the over wing exits. I did not hear this PA. The FO and I opened our air vents and the fuel odor got stronger and the condensation thickened. I then shut off the Ram Air; APU AIR switch; and both packs; which caused the fuel smell to lessen considerably in intensity and the condensation stopped completely. A man who works the ramp came up to the cockpit and told us we had fuel leaking out of the APU. I then told him to connect external power and I began to shut down the APU. I also told the first officer to go outside and inspect the APU fuel leak with the ops personnel. We informed ground of the fuel leak and we requested ARFF to come inspect the area as a precaution; which they did. I was told by the gate agent that only one person had jumped off the left wing. I was told by operations and my flight attendants that a few passengers came back into the airplane through the over wing doors; and the rest exited the wings on baggage belt loaders. There were no injuries that I know of. This was confirmed by all four flight attendants and ZZZ operations personnel. Upon inspection of the APU; fuel was in fact leaking out of the non-ram door area and the fuel spill was about fifteen feet in diameter. I was instructed by maintenance to pull 5 circuit breakers; which I did; secured the airplane with the securing check; and made the appropriate entries in the maintenance logbook.,,,,A fuel odor; later identified as an APU fuel issue; was detected as passengers began to deplane at the gate. A partial; uncommanded; evacuation was initiated by several passengers via the over wing exits. No injuries were reported.,"The incident occurred after a flight arrived at Airport ZZZ and completed its parking checklist. Upon opening the L1 door, the flight crew and forward flight attendants detected a faint fuel smell, which they initially attributed to external factors such as a neighboring aircraft being fueled, the APU running, and gusty northwest winds. The flight attendants requested the cockpit to make a passenger address (PA) to reassure passengers, which was done. However, there was a misunderstanding regarding the status of the aircraft doors and exits. Passengers, believing there was an emergency, opened the over wing exits and began exiting onto the wings without authorization. Despite efforts by the flight attendants to stop the uncommanded evacuation, several passengers exited before being directed back into the aircraft. The fuel smell intensified, leading the flight crew to shut off the APU and air conditioning systems, which reduced the odor and condensation. A ground staff member informed the cockpit of a fuel leak near the APU, prompting the crew to secure the aircraft, shut down the APU, and request ARFF (Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting) support as a precaution. Maintenance personnel inspected the APU and identified a fuel leak. The crew secured the aircraft, performed the necessary checks, and documented the issue in the maintenance logbook. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further incident. The cause of the fuel odor was later identified as a fuel leak from the APU, which was addressed by maintenance.",equipment malfunction

I was the A Flight Attendant (FA) so I made an all call to the crew to see if they smelled it also. All flight attendants smelled a strange odor. The front smelled like musty socks and the back smelled like parmesan cheese. I called the captain to tell him about the smell and he said they smelled it as well but they were climbing higher and thought it would dissipate. The D-E-H were all sitting in the forward galley with me. We all had headaches and distorted vision. Soon afterwards; I called the back galley to see if the odor dissipated; it didn't and was informed that our one pregnant (F) Flight attendant was being put on Oxygen. I called the captain to tell him that (F) was on oxygen and while I was on the phone I was informed B-C-F were all on Oxygen. I told the captain we didn't feel safe continuing. He said they were turning the plane around. I got up to go check on the FA's in the back and immediately felt light-headed and caught myself on the jumpseat. The E flight attendant told me to sit down and we got the oxygen bottles down and we were sharing the two bottles between the four of us. We were in the air for about 50 mins total. We landed at XA:14. Upon landing no one in inflight met our aircraft. The 'B' FA called crew service center and within 15 minutes inflight showed up to check on us. We told the inflight supervisors that we wanted to have blood tests run for Carbon Monoxide poisoning. They arranged for transportation to see a company doctor. We arrived there at XC:00. The company doctor said that he couldn't do the blood test. We were involved in many company calls through-out this ordeal and taxis were arranged for us to go to the hospital to get the blood test done. I was never seen by the company doctor since the taxis were on their way to take us to the Emergency Room (ER). A Manager showed up and about an hour later the taxis came. We arrived at the Hospital [5 hours after landing]. We saw the gate agent; who met our flight; in the ER waiting room; who didn't feel well; and we were informed also that three of our passengers needed treatment. The ER process was very fast and had blood drawn to check our CO levels. The doctor informed us that we should have been admitted soon after getting off the airplane. The test results will be forwarded to the company. According to Station Maintenance they washed the left engine the night before and were supposed to let it run for 10-20 minutes as procedure dictated; but the proper time wasn't allotted.I suggest during a fume incident that it should be company policy that you go straight to the ER for CO testing.I suggest that maintenance not take shortcuts when it comes to crew & passenger safety.,,We opened the auxiliary kit and put on masks. It was decided that the F needed to go on oxygen immediately as she is 5 months pregnant and we did not know what kind of fumes we were inhaling. Within 10 minutes from the beginning of the smell; we had 2 more bottles of oxygen between the other 3 of us in the back (B; C and G). The G decided not to use oxygen.Upon landing and deplaning we were not met by any manager; supervisor or paramedic. We had to call to ask someone to meet us. We were told by our pilots (who received information from the engineers); that the planes left engine had been cleaned the night before and 'may' not have had the engine run for 10-20 minutes to burn off chemicals; even though that is protocol after engines are cleaned.At this point; I was extremely disoriented; my eyes burned and I had a splitting headache. We all wanted to see a doctor and have our CO levels tested. Shayna began making calls and arranged for [medical] to pick us all up. It took over an hour between getting off the plane and being picked up to be checked out by the company doctor.We found out shortly after arriving at clinic that they would be unable to perform the blood test we needed done. At this point we were trying to get [ground] to take us someplace that could do the test. A Manager showed up and said taxis were on their way. It took about an hour and a half to be shuttled to the hospital.Once at the hospital; we were all admitted extremely quickly. Once I met with the doctor; my blood was drawn and tested for CO levels. The doctor told me it was most likely to come back with normal levels because of how long it had been since our exposure to the toxic fumes and that we should have been tested within a few hours. The test results will be forwarded to the company.There needs to be a very specific protocol for when there is a toxic fume event. We should NOT have been sent to [company medical provider]. They were extremely unprofessional and were unable to perform the test we needed done. Hours were lost spending time there and getting transportation to a location that was able to do the test.,,After takeoff; A330 flight attendants detected a strong chemical odor similar to 'spoiled eggs and vomit' which physiologically affected the crew and passengers. The flight returned to the departure airport. Post flight medical examinations revealed physiological symptoms; but blood tests samples were hours delayed and inconclusive.,"The incident involved a flight where a strong chemical odor, described as resembling spoiled eggs and vomit, was detected shortly after takeoff. This odor led to physiological symptoms such as headaches and vision issues among the flight attendants and passengers. The flight was subsequently turned around and returned to the departure airport. Upon landing, the crew experienced delays in receiving medical attention, as the initial medical provider was unable to conduct necessary blood tests promptly. The ground personnel indicated that the odor may have originated from the left engine, which had been cleaned the night before but not run long enough to eliminate fumes, as per protocol. The flight attendant suggested improved protocols for carbon monoxide testing and against maintenance shortcuts, while the ground personnel emphasized the need for specific procedures and criticized the delayed medical response. The medical tests conducted hours later were inconclusive due to the delay.",equipment malfunction

I stopped the passenger from going to seat and asked where he put the cigarette. He denied it of course and when he opened his mouth it was as if a cloud of smoke came out. The smell was so strong. I had him stand in galley while I searched the LAV with the door opened. I opened the trash bin and pulled out the compartment. There was a bunch of paper towels and one Budweiser can (he had been drinking that). I pulled can out and smoke was coming out of the can. I called for the other Flight Attendant to get me a bunch of bottles of water while I put the can under water in the sink. I poured about 4 bottles into the can to ensure there was no possibility of a fire. He still continued to deny he did anything; but I said you were the only one drinking Budweiser and you were the only one in the LAV in the last half hour. I told him to give me his ID and go to his seat. He said 'can I talk to you?' To which I replied 'give me your ID take your seat and I will speak to you later.' Flight Attendant B notified A; who notified the Captain. Flight Attendant A made another no smoking announcement. I copied his information and filled out crewmember report of smoking. I gave him the bottom portion which notifies him that the incident will be reported to FAA. I also returned his ID. He started to say something and I stopped him. I said to him that he needed to really think about what could have happened to all of us on the aircraft because of his irresponsible and dangerous action. Had we not caught this immediately; I can't even imagine. He then pretended to sleep the remainder of the flight. The smoke detector did not go off. It should have.,,,,An A319 passenger was smoking a cigarette in the lavatory but the smoke detector failed to alert.

A few minutes later we received an ACARS message that a new maintenance release was required as well as a status message on the printer advising the aircraft was ready for release. Before having an opportunity to address the maintenance status the lead flight attendant advised she was concerned about the location of an armed passenger and the status of a dog on board and advised another attendant had had a verbal conflict with a gate agent regarding overhead bin space and was asking for our intervention. Finally after dealing with these issues we pushed back and immediately realized we hadn't called maintenance about the unusual maintenance release status. Maintenance attempted to send the release to the printer but were unable. They then sent a truck out with a hard copy passed in through a cockpit window.  We; then; started engines and continued the flight uneventfully.,,[Report narrative contained no pertinent additional information.],,Broken and deferred communications functions of ACARS combined with conflicts between flight attendants and passenger agents created a chaotic pre-departure scene which culminated with the flight crew's failure to obtain a hard copy maintenance release prior to gate departure.,"The incident occurred during the pre-departure phase of a flight, involving the Flight Crew and ground personnel. The Flight Crew encountered issues with the ACARS system, which was deferred, and the inoperative printer. Despite initial normal functionality during setup, they received conflicting messages about a maintenance release and aircraft readiness. Before addressing this, they had to handle concerns from the flight attendants regarding an armed passenger, a dog onboard, and a verbal conflict with a gate agent over overhead bin space. After resolving these issues, the crew pushed back and started engines, only to realize they lacked a maintenance release. Maintenance attempted to send the release digitally but failed, opting instead to deliver a hard copy via the cockpit window. The flight crew proceeded safely with the hard copy. The incident was caused by communication system failures and conflicts, leading to the delayed acquisition of necessary documentation, but the flight continued without further issues.",equipment malfunction

I notified the captain. On the CRJ-700; the main cabin door is the main source of egress in an emergency evacuation.  The configuration of the stairs on the inside of the cabin contain instructions for properly closing and opening the door.  In an emergency where the flight attendant is incapacitated; passengers must open the door.  The stairs on this aircraft were installed incorrectly and the instructions; placards; emergency lights and instructions are in the incorrect place; thereby potentially causing a delay in evacuating the aircraft in the event of an emergency.  Incorrect configuration of the main cabin door. This issue would have caused multiple cancellations and delays; however; I would insist on contacting Maintenance and checking the procedures before completing the flight.,Reporter stated that two of the raised steps on the main cabin door were not reinstalled to their original positions during a C-Check; after the main door had been reconnected to the CRJ-700 aircraft. With the door in the 'open' position; the second raised step from the bottom was swapped with the third step. The second step has a recessed handgrip in the step plate that is used to pull and guide the door during latch handle closing; opening and during emergency exiting. The third raised step from the bottom has placards for exit; door open/close procedures; emergency open procedures; and an emergency light. The steps were out of sequence.Reporter stated the Captain would not call Maintenance or write-up the incorrect step configuration due to lack of company Maintenance at the stations they were flying to. Other flight attendants told her the same condition had also been found on their CRJ-200 series aircraft; but no one was correcting or taking the situation seriously.  Contact was made with a Maintenance Manager who pulled the aircraft from service within three hours after being made aware of the situation. The discrepancy was corrected. Maintenance Manager noted that mechanics and Quality Assurance had missed the incorrect step configuration during reinstallation of the door.

Flight Crew reported to Maintenance a squeal in the cabin during Deadhead to ZZZ1. Line Maintenance arrived to investigate and requested Flight Crew to start engines with [Main Cabin] door shut. After listening in the cabin at normal pressure levels on the ground; Maintenance put aircraft pressurization system into manual mode and descended the cabin until reaching 3.0 psi and back to unpressurized; approximately 15 minutes. Crew experienced uncomfortable ear pressure but no other medical concerns. Maintenance tightened a connection in Pack-1 and Aircraft returned to service. In ZZZ; the following morning; Captain obtained a copy of the Maintenance procedures including the BOLD WARNING about non-essential personnel not being onboard. This pressurization took the flight crew to a cabin altitude below sea level; there is concern similar to a scuba dive. Pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable. Company Medical was called; but by this time it was 24 hours past the pressurization event. The flight attendant; who has a hearing impairment and wears hearing aids; reported being more plugged up than usual and was removed at Company Medical Doctor's request. The Flight Crew unaware pressurization to 3.0 psi was planned. Line Maintenance did not have copy of procedure with them. Flight Crew unaware of potential hazard due to no briefing from Maintenance personnel and no written copy of maintenance procedure. Ensure that when procedures are communicated from Maintenance Control to Line Maintenance; that warnings are transmitted. Provide written guidance on Flight Crew assisting Maintenance or provide adequate personnel to perform procedure without ANY assistance from Flight Crew.,Reporter stated the air conditioning packs on the EMB-145 are located in the wing root area under the cabin seats. The cabin pressure controller knob is extremely sensitive and controlling a rate of descent of 500 feet per minute is very difficult in the manual mode. The EICAS display indicated the cabin pressure had gone down to 1;500 feet during the ground pressurization leak check. What the actual pressure ended up being; he is not sure; but flying at altitude after that may not have been advisable as he learned later.,Crew was Deadheading in the cabin on an EMB-145 aircraft to ZZZ1 and heard a squeal sound when pilots added power. Upon landing captain informed Maintenance Control. Control contacted ZZZ1 contract mechanic to investigate a squeal sound in the aircraft cabin. Maintenance Control directed crew to start engines while contract mechanic and Maintenance Control investigated the squeal. Contract mechanic was on the phone with Maintenance Control. The mechanics believed the issue was a loose connection in the PACK systems. However; without the flight crew knowing; Maintenance Control directed contract mechanic to conduct an 'air check.'Crew was unaware of this procedure and not briefed prior. Contract mechanic did not have a checklist. Flight Attendant was onboard. Contract mechanic; under the direction of Maintenance Control; and without warning to the crew onboard; pressurized the cabin substantially below sea level using the manual mode pressurization system to achieve a 3.0 psi pressure differential. Crew and contract mechanic experienced uncomfortable ear pressures during the procedure and the procedure was stopped within 15 minutes. Contract mechanic tightened the PACK connections and under the direction of Maintenance Control the contract mechanic signed off his work. Crew did not report any medical conditions preventing the safe operation of the aircraft. Flight operated safely back to base; conducting flight back to ZZZ. This report is being submitted for the operation of two flights; ZZZ-ZZZ1-ZZZ; because the crew were on board an aircraft which was pressurized below sea level prior to these flights. The concern arises from the possibility that pressurizing the aircraft to a pressure below sea level may expose flight crews to injuries similar to those of scuba divers. Captain contacted Maintenance Controller X who stated that this procedure was not dangerous. Captain obtained the 'leak check' procedure from ZZZ Company Maintenance department and found the procedure was not what the crew witnessed. The crew did not have prior knowledge of the Medical Warning found on page one of the procedure. Captain contacted ZZZ Chief Pilot who did not know how to proceed but directed the captain to Company Medical. Captain called Company Medical whose Doctor concluded that further flights would be safe because 12-hours had elapsed from the exposure. However; Flight Attendant; who wears hearing aids was removed by Company Medical Doctor to evaluate ear conditions prior flying again.Crew was not briefed that Maintenance Control had directed contract mechanic to conduct a 'leak check.' Contract mechanic under the authority of Maintenance Control conducted the check without a visual checklist. This is not the first report captain has submitted highlighting the prevalence of Maintenance Control talking contract mechanics through a procedure via telephone. This practice is potentially dangerous especially if the WARNINGS in the procedures are not communicated to those persons inside an aircraft during these procedures. Company should issue written standards to the flight department outlining the approved procedures which would allow pilots and crew to assist contract mechanics with the servicing and maintaining of the aircraft fleet. These verbal procedures are potentially hazardous especially to flight crew because flight crew often operate in extreme environments and with limited time on the ground to acclimate or recover from exposures. Because the FAA relies largely on the science of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) for infection control procedures; then FAA should likely consult hyperbaric medical societies for procedures involving aircraft pressurization and the standards for medical screening of crew and passengers involved in these procedures and involved in inflight rapid depressurization events.,,A Contract Mechanic was directed by Maintenance Control to pressurize the cabin of an EMB-145 aircraft to below sea level in the manual mode. Flight crew and Flight Attendant were not made aware after being requested to start engines with the main cabin door closed. Uncomfortable ear pressure was experienced. Crew departed in the morning; but pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable due to scuba dive effect.,"The incident involved an EMB-145 aircraft operated by a flight crew from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and back. During the deadhead trip, the crew heard a squeal in the cabin and reported it to maintenance. Maintenance requested the crew to start engines with the cabin door closed and proceeded to manually pressurize the cabin to 3.0 psi without informing the crew. This resulted in uncomfortable ear pressure for the crew and the flight attendant, who has a hearing impairment, leading to her removal by a doctor. The root cause was the maintenance team's failure to brief the crew, lack of a checklist, and reliance on verbal procedures. The captain later discovered that the procedure followed wasn't the standard one, and this wasn't the first such incident, highlighting potential dangers of verbal communication in extreme environments. The proposed solutions include establishing written company procedures for maintenance and crew assistance, and consulting medical experts for safer pressurization standards. The outcome emphasized the need for clear communication and standardized procedures to prevent future incidents.",equipment malfunction

Called Maintenance as the IFE Contractor had put an entry in the logbook as accomplished work card 23-32-00 (ops check system normal). RJAA Maintenance arrived at the gate and I asked him if he could remove the system placard. He called the IFE Technician to the plane who then told me that the system worked but needed further troubleshooting. Logbook items 12; 13; 14 & 16 all addressed parts of the IFE system. Local Maintenance did not clear the IFE placard. Per the MEL 23-10 and NEF 23-33b; I instructed the Purser not to use the IFE system for any of the required passenger safety briefings; or other pre-recorded announcements. After departure; I was made aware that the IFE system was used for the passenger safety demo. Apparently; the Purser decided to use the system after being instructed by me (Captain) not to use this equipment.  AFTER GATE ARRIVAL THE PURSER CAME TO COCKPIT; I DISCUSSED WITH HER THE VIOLATION OF POLICY AND POSSIBLE FAR'S REGARDING USE OF AN AIRCRAFT SYSTEM THAT WAS ON MEL PLACARD; AND THAT THE FINAL AUTHORITY FOR OPERATION OF COMPANY EQUIPMENT RESTS WITH THE CAPTAIN DESIGNATED ON THE FLIGHT RELEASE.  SHE TOLD ME THAT THE MECHANICS; AS THEY LEFT THE AIRCRAFT IN TOKYO; TOLD HER THE SYSTEM WAS FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND TO USE IT.  I POINTED OUT THAT THE CAPTAIN HAS THE LAST SAY REGARDING USE OF EQUIPMENT ON COMPANY AIRCRAFT AND THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE COORDINATED WHAT SHE BELIEVED PROPER USE WITH THE CAPTAIN AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY TOLD HER SPECIFICALLY NOT TO USE THE PRE-RECORDED PORTION OF THE IFE SYSTEM AS IT WAS PLACARDED INOP.,,Captain reviewed the logbook items and spoke to both the Narita Mechanic and two tech reps about the issue. [Captain] then declared that the IFE system would not be used by crew. In the course of the flight; it was discovered that the cabin crew made an attempt to utilize the IFE system which proved unsuccessful. Considering the consequences of an MD-11 accident and other experiences with IFE malfunctions and fires; adherence to Captain's directive needs to trump cabin crew intuition. Additionally; MEL/CDL/NEF guidance concerning placarding is vague and needs to be reduced to plain language with the mutual consent of the company and the FAA. This is the second time I've witnessed a problem involving crews and Maintenance personnel not understanding placarding procedures. This entire situation might've been averted if placarding guidance had clearly stated that an INOP sticker needed to be placed on the ON/OFF switch at the IFE control console.Remind cabin crew of Captain's authority. Simplify guidance for installing INOP stickers for MEL/CDU/NEF items; particularly those in the cabin.,,B777 Captain is informed after the fact that the Purser attempted to use the IFE system for passenger briefing after being advised that it was inoperative on MEL and not to be used.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and the flight attendant regarding the use of an inoperative In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) system on a B777 aircraft. The IFE system was placarded as inoperative (MEL 23-10) and the captain had instructed the purser not to use it for passenger safety briefings or other pre-recorded announcements. Despite this directive, the purser attempted to use the system during the safety briefing, believing it was functional based on communication with maintenance personnel. After the flight, the captain addressed the issue with the purser, emphasizing the captain's authority as the final decision-maker regarding the use of company equipment. The purser argued that maintenance had indicated the system was functional. The captain stressed the importance of adhering to MEL directives and the potential risks associated with using unapproved systems, referencing past incidents involving IFE malfunctions. The incident highlighted a gap in understanding of placarding procedures, with the captain proposing that guidance on MEL/CDL/NEF placarding should be simplified and standardized, particularly for systems in the cabin. Additionally, the captain recommended ensuring cabin crew awareness of the captain's authority and the importance of coordinating with the flight deck before using systems that are placarded inoperative. The B777 captain discovered that the purser had attempted to use the inoperative IFE system for passenger safety briefings despite being explicitly instructed not to do so. The purser believed the system was functional based on communication with maintenance. The captain emphasized the importance of adhering to MEL directives and clarified their authority as the final decision-maker. The incident underscored the need for clearer guidance on placarding procedures and cabin crew coordination with the flight deck.",equipment malfunction

Discussed the light with the Captain and because of the likelihood of a long delay in ZZZ; we elected to come to ZZZ1 and report the light 'On'. In ZZZ1; Maintenance found enough debris that the aircraft was removed from service to flush the oil system and recheck for debris. [Contributors]:1) There is no guidance for the flight crew regarding the chip detector. It is not part of the normal preflight inspection but the light is obvious if 'On'. Without guidance there is confusion as to whether this is something we should check or even be concerned about if it is 'On'. 2) The most common time to find this light 'On'; is during the first flight of the day preflight which is usually at an outstation. Due to the difficulty of getting Maintenance to the Outstation and the likelihood of a lengthy delay; it is difficult to convince myself; much less the Captain; that we should report the problem at the Outstation. This is the second time in the last two months I have delayed reporting the light 'On' to avoid delay at the Outstation. This is the first time out of six previous that required more than a simple cleaning of the detector. [Recommend that] clear guidelines for how the flight crew should react to the chip detector being 'On'; would prevent this in the future!,,,,A First Officer reports departing with the Left-Hand (LH) Chip Detector Light illuminated on their CRJ-200 aircraft. Maintenance at a downline Station found enough debris in chip detector to remove aircraft from service. Pilot noted that unclear guidance on chip detector light and on-time departure pressures were contributors.,"The incident involved a First Officer who reported that the Left-Hand (LH) Chip Detector Light was illuminated during the preflight inspection of their CRJ-200 aircraft. After discussing the issue with the Captain, they decided to divert to ZZZ1 due to concerns about potential delays at the outstation. Upon arrival, Maintenance discovered sufficient debris in the chip detector, leading to the aircraft being removed from service for oil system flushing and reinspection. Contributors to the incident included the lack of clear guidelines for flight crew regarding the chip detector light, which is not part of the standard preflight inspection. The First Officer noted that the light frequently illuminated during the first flight of the day at outstations, and the difficulty of obtaining timely Maintenance support at remote locations compounded the decision to delay reporting. This was the second occurrence in two months, with the first five instances requiring only a simple cleaning of the detector. To prevent future occurrences, the First Officer recommended the establishment of clear guidelines for flight crew actions when the chip detector light is illuminated, aiming to address confusion and reduce the risk of similar incidents.",equipment malfunction

The toilet paper holder was missing, and toilet paper was left on the sink counter. The ground crew, wearing hazmat suits, conducted a clean-up but failed to remove the aft galley carts, allowing toilet water to seep under them. This resulted in additional overflow during taxi and takeoff, saturating the cabin flooring, carpets under rows 23-25, and the aft galley.

It seems that we omitted this step due to task saturation.  This is an easy miss as the cabin advisory is no longer a checklist item.  This 10;000 FT signal seems to be omitted fairly regularly and is especially likely to be omitted during an abnormal event.  This problem could be alleviated if we reinstated the cabin notification in the Descent and Approach Checklist.,,,,Preoccupied with abnormal procedures generated by a bleed air duct temperature warning; the Flight Crew of a CRJ-200 failed to broadcast the alert to the Flight Attendants as they passed through 10;000 FT MSL as required by their company SOP.,"The incident involved a CRJ-200 flight crew and a flight attendant. During the flight, the crew encountered a 14th stage Bleed Air Duct warning, which led them to follow the QRH procedures, including selecting wings and cowls off and closing the left 14th stage bleed air. They declared an emergency and landed safely with the left engine at idle. Due to their focus on abnormal procedures and checklist management, the crew failed to provide the required cabin signal for descent through 10,000 FT as per the company's Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The flight attendant noted this omission during a post-flight discussion.

After the Lead Flight Attendant made his announcements; I thought I heard him say 'prepare doors.' I did so and began walking up the aisle checking on passengers. At this time; I realized that the front entry door and cockpit doors remained open. I proceeded to walk forward to inquire. When I arrived to the forward galley; a caterer came from the rear of the aircraft and informed us that he had popped the slide. We inquired if he was injured; and he said no. I followed him to the aft galley as he told me that he had seen the orange strap; but that his sunglasses had been giving off a glare and he had opened the door anyway. The slide had been fully deployed and was facing upward at an angle as the door was only partially opened. The gate agent; the caterer; and I placed the slide inside the aft galley so the plane could be taken to another gate and a new plane brought to our current gate. We immediately contacted the Captain and began to secure another aircraft; deplane passengers; and continue our flight. The entire procedure was done effectively and efficiently and we departed less than 50 minutes late and all connections were good.I am eternally thankful that no one was injured due to my misunderstanding and know in the future I will be on high alert and double check myself. In this job; there are so many things going on at once in an attempt to board passengers; stow their bags; do our duties and depart on time. Sometimes; I get caught up in repetitive routines like simply shutting the doors and preparing for the demo that I have neglected a very important aspect. I should have immediately returned to the aft galley and 'unprepared' my doors as soon as I saw the forward entry door was open.

The Flight Attendant believed they had heard the Lead Flight Attendant instruct to ""prepare doors"" and proceeded to check the cabin. Upon reaching the forward galley, they discovered the front entry door and cockpit doors were open. A caterer approached and explained that they had intentionally opened the forward entry door, mistaking the orange safety strap for a signal to deploy the slide due to sunglass glare. The slide was fully deployed and facing upward, creating an obstruction. The Flight Attendant, along with the caterer and gate agent, secured the slide, moved the aircraft to another gate, and coordinated with ground staff to bring a replacement aircraft. Passengers were deplaned, and the flight resumed less than 50 minutes after the initial delay. No injuries were reported, and the situation was handled efficiently. The Flight Attendant acknowledged the importance of double-checking procedures and expressed gratitude for the positive outcome.

Normal departure out of TEB [and] at 1;000 FT AGL engaged the autopilot. Autopilot flew the SID properly [and] leveled off 1;500 FT on a 240 degree heading. Autopilot turned aircraft towards 280 degree heading; but failed to stop and continued another 20-30 degrees. I disconnected autopilot immediately to turn back to 280 degree heading. At the same time ATC instructed us to expedite climb to 6;000 FT. My First Officer answered the call and I began to climb. In the same transmission ATC also instructed us to turn right direct to BREZY. My First Officer responded to that and directed the FMS to take us to BREZY. As we made the turn and climb; ATC questioned us as to where we were going and [told us] that we should be on a 280 degree heading. I immediately turned back to 280 degrees. My First Officer responded; 'You gave us direct to BREZY.' ATC responded that he was sorry he missed the incorrect read back and not to worry; it was his mistake. He said he had asked us to expedite the climb and to 'expect a right turn direct BREZY.' A contributing factor to the miscommunication was the busyness of the frequency workload on the Controller; the aural warning of the autopilot disconnect causing additional noise in the headset for my First Officer; as well as the FMS and autopilot incorrectly flying the SID. A corrective action would be for ATC not to accept an incorrect read back in such a crucial phase of flight. I will [also] hand fly the SID form now on. Discouraging as it is; I will not trust the approved FMS and autopilot to actually fly the SID.

However, the crew incorrectly read back the instructions as ""cleared direct to BREZY,"" which ATC later acknowledged was their mistake due to workload and miscommunication. Contributing factors included the controller's busy frequency, the autopilot's aural warning causing headset noise, and the FMS and autopilot's incorrect handling of the SID. As a result, the captain decided to hand-fly the SID in the future, distrusting the FMS and autopilot.

The aircraft also had one MEL; the APU was inoperative; so we had to do an external air start at the gate. While taxiing to the runway; we performed a cross bleed start on the number one engine. Everything was normal during the taxi; beside the aircraft getting warm while using the bleed air to operate the air conditioning packs.We were in the takeoff roll; well past 80 KTS and approaching V1 when we received a call chime from the Flight Attendant. I was the pilot flying and decided to continue the takeoff; as we were within a few KTS of V1. While I was rotating the aircraft; we received a second call from the Flight Attendant using the cabin emergency call button. After raising the gear and configuring the aircraft; the First Officer answered the call. She said; 'There's smoke in the cabin; down the floor aisle.' We immediately informed Tower of the situation and that we would like to return. At the same time; the Flight Attendant called back saying she was seeing smoke coming out from along the aisle; down around where the emergency lights are. I asked her if it smelled like smoke; a burning smell; or an electrical smell. She went to investigate and then call us back.We were still on the SID and I had started to level off back down to 3;000 FT.The Flight Attendant called back and said that there is no smell at all; the smoke is like a mist; and it is cold air coming out. Tower at this time asked us if we would like to land on [Runway] XXR or YYR. We informed the Tower that we were still analyzing the problem; so he sent us to Departure. We contacted Departure and he had us fly heading 185 degrees and climb to 4;000 FT.The Flight Attendant called us to say that the smoke had gone away; but as soon as I added thrust to climb to 4;000 FT the smoke reappeared. I asked if there was any smell again and she said no; and [that] it was still cold air coming out. All this happened in a very short time frame. At this time we realized that it was not smoke; but condensation coming from the air conditioning packs. We had received no indications of anything abnormal in the cockpit; no EICAS messages; and all readings on the systems page of the MFD were normal. The cabin was warm and humid from the taxi out; so the temperature control was set to cold on the Flight Attendant control panel.At this point; Departure asked us what we wanted to do. We talked about that if we returned we would have to perform an overweight landing; around 4;500 LBS overweight. We decided it was safe to continue the flight. Departure gave us a heading to rejoin the SID; which put us on a heading that we could return if need be.The Flight Attendant called us back to say the condensation was gone and had not returned. At no time while talking with Tower or Departure did we declare an emergency; only saying initially to the Tower that we needed to return to the airport. That was before we had all the information about what was happening in the cabin. Only after evaluating the facts did we decide not to return.Concentrating on planning a return overweight landing while running checklists; coordinating with ATC; and communicating with the Flight Attendant can lead to missed steps. I must continue to stay vigilant and not rush through things while also maintaining the safety of the aircraft; passengers; and crew. Also; [while] not dismissing the Flight Attendant's call; [I should] not be distracted by it during the critical phase of takeoff (especially near or at V1) until it is safe to answer. I never want to discourage anyone on the flight crew to inform me if there is a problem or safety issue.,,To prevent this type of situation from occurring again; flight crew should be aware of the difference between smoke and mist from the air conditioning packs.,,An E145 flight crew continued their takeoff when the Flight Attendant called as they approached V1. After airborne the Attendant advised of 'smoke' coming from the floor of the cabin. The smoke eventually was determined to be condensation from the air conditioning system as it cooled the hot humid air. The flight continued to its destination when the condensation was identified and later abated.,"The incident involved an E145 aircraft with an inoperative Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), requiring an external air start. During takeoff, the flight attendant reported ""smoke"" in the cabin, prompting the flight crew to consider returning to the airport. However, after further investigation, the ""smoke"" was identified as condensation from the air conditioning packs, which was exacerbated by the warm and humid cabin air from the taxi. The flight crew ultimately decided to continue the flight after the condensation dissipated and determined there was no immediate threat to safety. The proposed solution emphasizes the importance for flight crew to recognize the difference between smoke and condensation from the air conditioning system.",equipment malfunction

The aircraft was in taxi out mode. The other Flight Attendant noticed that the safety strap at the L2 door was stuck in the door. I tried to pull it back in; but it would not budge. I saw some light coming through from where the strap was. I called the flightdeck; apologized for interrupting; and asked if they were showing any indications of the integrity of the seal being breeched. He said everything looked fine. I told him about the strap. I said that if he could stop the aircraft; I could quickly crack the door and bring the strap back in. He said it wasn't as easy as that because the aircraft was already pressurized. I then asked him what the ramifications could be if we left it alone. He said that it might cause a squealing sound on climb but should eventually go away when we leveled off. So; I said as long as there weren't any warning bells; and he was comfortable with leaving it; then I would leave it alone. I also said that I would contact him if anything happened. As soon as we took off; the door started squealing; and it actually got louder the higher we went. It could be heard full force all the way up to the divider. It was like a horn being blown. I waited until 10;000 to see if it would go away; but it didn't. I called the pilots; and they could hear it over the intercom without me telling them. He suggested putting a wet rag on it. That didn't do anything. No one was complaining about any physical reactions; except the other Flight Attendant was getting a headache. The noise was just so obnoxiously loud that it wasn't right to put the passengers through it. So; the Captain returned to the departure airport. On the ground; a mechanic from one of the smaller airlines; came and checked out the door seal; said it was fine; we took on more gas; and we left. Maybe emphasizing something like 'strap check' in the whole door closure routine.,,Excessively loud squeal from L2 Door caused by safety strap caught in door pressure seal. [I] elected to return to the departure airport to remove safety strap. Flight Attendant called us in the cockpit from the back of the aircraft while we were approaching the runway prior to takeoff to advise us that a safety strap was caught in an aft service/entry door. After a discussion of the situation with the crew and verification by the Flight Attendant visually and by cockpit indication that the doors were closed and locked; my assessment was that there were no associated safety of flight issues and no risk of damage to the aircraft. I discussed my assessment with the crew; considered the alternatives and the comfort level of the crew with the process; and elected to go. As is the case in situations like this; there were factors that biased my assessment that it would be OK to fly with the strap in the door frame. My bias factors were: 1. Previous experience. I had experienced safety straps in the doors of Boeing aircraft on occasion over the years; and had discussed with others their experiences. That basis of experience set my frame of reference to the situation. My mindset was that if there was no metal piece of the strap caught in the door; and nothing extending to the outside of the door; that we could operate with safety and without risk of aircraft damage. 2. Progress of flight and operational considerations. We were operating out of an airport without a Control Tower; with a limitation for one IFR or special VFR aircraft allowed to operate in the airspace at a time. We had our clearance; and had aircraft waiting behind us to receive their clearance after we exited the airspace. We discussed the possibility of having the Flight Attendant pop open the door and pull the strap in; but we were pre-pressurized for takeoff and I was not keen on the safety aspect of having the door popped open without stairs up to the aircraft. So the remaining option was to taxi down the runway and back to the ramp; shut down; bring the stairs; and open the door to clear the strap. That option also would have made it necessary to refuel to bring us back to our required fuel after the taxi burn; which at this particular airport equates to a significant wait time for the fueler to show up. Did I make the right choice? No. That was apparent to me immediately during climbout when the flight attendants called on the Service Interphone and I could hear the squeal in the background. I had heard pressure squeals in the past but nothing close to the loudness of this one. Would I make that choice again? No. What I will do and what I would share with other crews is that it is necessary to clear the strap from the door frame prior to flight. Doesn't matter if it requires a taxi-back; another de-ice; more fuel; ATC clearance issues; or any other operationally undesirable factors which exist.,,A B737's L2 door safety strap was trapped in the door seal after it was closed but the crew decided to depart only to return to the departure airport because of the excessively loud squeal.,"The incident involved a safety strap on the B737's L2 door becoming trapped during closure. The flight attendant noticed the issue and informed the cockpit, but the pilots assessed it as low risk, deciding to proceed with takeoff. During the flight, a loud squealing noise developed, prompting an immediate return to the departure airport. Mechanics confirmed the door's integrity, and the flight resumed after refueling. The flight attendant suggested incorporating a more thorough strap check into pre-flight procedures. The pilot acknowledged bias from past experiences and operational constraints, learning the importance of resolving such issues before takeoff to prevent disruptions.",equipment malfunction

I advised Commercial radio and a discrete HF frequency was arranged and the patch was made. An on board ER nurse attended the passenger; made evaluations; provided treatment; and talked directly to Medlink. Medlink advised that we could continue and to provide O2 as needed. The Flight Attendant advised that they were using the Therapeutic O2 bottle. The Flight Attendant later advised us when the therapeutic bottle reached 250 PSI and a decompression bottle was used. As we still had several hours of flying; we discussed O2 use; and operational restrictions regarding depletion of O2 bottles. The First Officer and I discussed that the safest course of action; regardless of O2 quantities; would be to remain at altitude. I advised the First Officer that I was exercising Captains Emergency Authority in the event any of those bottles went below the prescribed volumes in order to remain at altitude. I discussed an O2 use plan with the Flight Attendant. We discussed using one decompression bottle to 1;500 PSI; then switch to the other decompression bottle; and use it until depleted. Shortly afterwards; she advised me that the first decompression bottle was at 1;250 PSI. I told her to switch to decompression bottle two; use it to 1;500 PSI; then use decompression bottle one; and deplete it. My thought was to ensure the Flight Attendant's maintained full capabilities in their mobility bottles. Shortly after this discussion; the  Flight Attendant advised that they could use their mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. With this information we revised our plan to include the mobility bottles as long as they ensured the mobility bottles did not go below 1;000 PSI. ACARS messages were sent to Dispatch advising them of the O2 usage and the volume levels of the bottles. After the second decompression bottle was used to 1;500 PSI; two mobility bottles were depleted to 1;000 PSI and a third was being used as we began our descent. Upon landing we were met by medics and the passenger was transported to medical facilities. Once we were deplaned I discussed O2 bottle usage with the Flight Attendants to ensure I fully understood the amount used. I discovered that the therapeutic bottle was depleted to 250 PSI; the number one decompression bottle to 250 PSI; number two to 1;500 PSI; and two mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. Mechanics boarded the aircraft; were advised and we discussed the write ups of the bottles as well as the EMK. [We were in a] high workload environment in ETOPS airspace. Medlink event happened near a waypoint with need to arrange for Medlink; plot; and report waypoints; monitor Medlink transmissions via HF; and derive an O2 use plan with Flight Attendant's that would be sufficient for a number of hours. There appeared to be confusion between the naming conventions of each type of bottle and the amount we could use before encountering altitude restrictions. I thought that the Flight Attendant was trading the names of the therapeutic bottle and the decompression bottle. Once on the ground I discovered that both the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle were depleted to 250 PSI.,,,,An  Air Carrier flight crew depleted their cabin oxygen bottles below acceptable limits while treating a passenger who became ill near the ETP. There was confusion with naming conventions of the bottles and operational restrictions.,"The incident involved a flight crew and a flight attendant responding to a passenger illness requiring medical attention during a flight in ETOPS airspace. The flight attendant initially requested Medlink assistance, and the crew arranged for a discrete HF frequency to facilitate communication. An onboard emergency room nurse evaluated the passenger, and Medlink advised continuing the flight while providing oxygen as needed. The flight attendant used a therapeutic oxygen bottle, later switching to decompression bottles and mobility bottles as the flight progressed. Despite efforts to manage oxygen levels, confusion arose regarding the naming conventions and operational restrictions of the oxygen bottles. As a result, some bottles were depleted below prescribed limits. Upon landing, the crew reviewed the oxygen usage and discovered discrepancies in the bottle levels, including the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle being depleted to 250 PSI. Mechanics were boarded to address the oxygen bottle write-ups and ensure compliance with safety standards. Post-incident, the crew discussed the oxygen bottle usage to clarify naming conventions and prevent future operational issues.",equipment malfunction

I immediately called the flight crew to inform them that all the power in the galley went out and the overhead lights flickered in the entire cabin. They informed me that they had a problem with a generator and were about to diagnose the problem. The same problem repeated a few more times as we lost galley power and lights in the cabin. Later the cockpit informed the Purser that it was safe to continue the trip. I was concerned that we were over land and that I did not feel comfortable flying across the Atlantic with one broken generator. Another Flight Attendant called the cockpit to ask them how safe it was to continue. The cockpit was evasive and never said whether it was safe or not. It led us to think that continuing to fly over the Atlantic and gambling with our lives on this issue was not being cautious enough; especially since we were still over land at the time of the generator problem.Later; another Flight Attendant informed me that the pilots told him that we have seven of these generators and that only one failed. Nevertheless; it did not put me at ease to think that we were going to fly over the ocean even after raising concerns about the dangerous goods on board. Was the airplane safe enough to continue its voyage? It is not for me to say as I have no control over the issue but it sure raised concern as to problems that can be resolved over land and not while over the ocean. Failed generators should not be taken lightly when planning to fly over the Atlantic.,,,,After one generator failed shortly after takeoff; the flight attendants aboard a B777-200 headed for an Atlantic crossing failed to have their concerns about the safety of continuing the flight properly addressed by the flight crew.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding the safety of continuing a transatlantic flight after a generator failure. Shortly after takeoff, the flight attendant reported multiple instances of generator power loss, including flickering cabin lights and a loss of galley power. The flight crew diagnosed the issue but provided unclear reassurances about the safety of continuing the flight, particularly since the problem occurred while still over land. The flight attendant expressed concerns about the risks of crossing the Atlantic with a failed generator and questioned whether the aircraft was sufficiently safe. Despite the pilots' assurance that only one of seven generators had failed, the flight attendant remained uneasy, highlighting the risks of unresolved issues over water. The incident raised concerns about the adequacy of communication and safety assessments during critical flight phases. No specific solution was proposed in the context, but the need for clearer communication and reassessment of safety concerns was implied.",equipment malfunction

I proceeded to get up and disarm the slide and remove the red strap across the window. I then turned on the POS to transmit and unlocked the lavatories. I left the galley and stood by the aft lavatories and watched the deplaning process. A few passengers came back to use the restroom. Deplaning was a slow process.When there were only a few passengers left another Flight Attendant suggested we check to make sure the slides were disarmed. I was not expecting anything to be wrong. She then turned and said that my slide was still armed but my red strap was undone. I was in total disbelief! I could not believe that when I bent down to disarm the slide that I did not. I have never removed the red strap prior to disarming the door. I have always been extremely careful in following procedures. I cannot explain why the slide was not disarmed. I can see myself bending down and disarming the door. There were no emergencies or passengers asking for things or anything to disrupt my routine. However; when I proceeded back to disarm the door the second time; I did notice that the hooks that the slide sits in when disarmed were loose. The bar was more or less just sitting in the hooks rather than needing to be pressed down. So now I wonder if I put the bar in the hooks but did not make certain they were in there securely and they slipped out. My error is that I did not double and triple check the disarmed door to make sure the bar stayed in the hooks and would not fall out. Another factor may have been that I was tired and ready to get off the airplane. What I learned in this situation was to just step back and review all of the procedures each and every time I am disarming/arming a door. Maybe it has become such a habit that I need to make sure I am absolutely aware of what I am doing at all times.,,,,A B737-900 Flight Attendant failed to properly disarm her emergency exit. An alert compatriot noted the error and the omission was promptly corrected.,"The incident occurred during the deplaning process of a B737-900 aircraft when the lead flight attendant failed to properly disarm her emergency exit slide. After completing routine procedures, including disarming the slide and removing the red strap, the lead attendant monitored the deplaning process. However, an alert colleague noticed the slide was still armed, prompting the lead attendant to re-examine her actions. Upon revisiting, she discovered the slide's hooks were loose, causing the bar to slip out. Reflecting on the oversight, the lead attendant attributed the error to not thoroughly securing the bar and possible fatigue. She learned the importance of meticulously reviewing procedures each time, especially ensuring the bar was securely placed. The colleague's timely intervention corrected the error, emphasizing the value of diligence and teamwork in safety protocols.",equipment malfunction

Corrective action had been taken; including replacing a temperature controller. We also could not control the pack valves with the temperature controllers in auto or manual. At cruise altitude; the left pack ran full hot and resulted in a duct overheat. The overheat produced a strong hot ducting smell in the cabin before it tripped and cooled off. The passengers and Flight Attendants were briefly alarmed and both pilots donned O2 masks and accomplished the Smoke/Fumes Checklists until we were sure the incident was from the duct overheat. Good air quality was regained and we continued to our destination. Here is the error that led to the overheat and smell: We discovered in the next few minutes of flight that the temperature controllers were cross wired. The left [temp selector] controlled the right pack valve and the right controlled the left pack valve. We caused the duct overheat by moving the right [temp selector] to manual hot to unstick a full cold right valve; but this caused the left valve to run full hot. Attempts to cool the left side with the left [temp selector] only kept the right full cold. When Maintenance replaced the temperature controller they failed to verify it was hooked up properly. A simple check with the APU running would have allowed them to confirm left to left and right to right.[There was] uncontrollable air conditioning due to Maintenance error. When replacing systems that are identical and parallel; Maintenance needs to ensure they are not cross wired. A Functional Test of the system controller should be required before the item is signed off.,Reporter stated he had a lengthy discussion with one of their mechanics after the flight arrival in order to give Maintenance a clear picture of the temperature control problems were. The Packs did respond to their Temperature Selector positions; once he and the First Officer figured out what was going on with the Left and Right Selectors. The gate Mechanic went up and checked the Canon plug connectors for the Temperature Selectors and found them cross-connected.,,,A Captain reports about uncontrollable air conditioning high temperatures at cruise altitude on a B737-500 caused by Maintenance error. Crew could not control pack temperatures with temperature selectors in auto or manual. Temperature controller had been replaced earlier; a Functional Check was not performed. New controller was found to be cross-wired.,"The incident involved a B737-500 aircraft experiencing uncontrollable high temperatures in the cabin during cruise altitude. The issue arose due to a maintenance error when replacing the temperature controller. The replacement was not properly tested, resulting in the temperature controllers being cross-wired. This caused the left pack to run at full heat, leading to a duct overheat and a strong smell in the cabin. The crew donned oxygen masks and followed smoke/fumes checklists to resolve the situation, after which normal air quality was restored, and the flight continued to its destination. The proposed solution is to conduct a functional test of the system controller before signing off on such maintenance tasks to prevent similar incidents.",equipment malfunction

Noted MEL 25-02c for 4R aft door Flight Attendant jumpseat no retract. MEL states that seat must be secured retracted with 'tape of a contrasting color' and that the nearest passenger seat must be reserved for the Flight Attendant; and placarded 'For Flight Attendant Use Only'. Commuter flight was 4 hours late; and I was 1.5 hours late for sign in. Aircraft was loaded and the crew and passengers were ready to go when I boarded. [I] gave a brief to the Purser; who was someone familiar to me; and asked if they had taken note of the placarded seat. She said they had; so we departed after completing all checklists. Logbook was properly filled out and placarded for the jumpseat; but I did not physically check the seat. Two hours into the flight we got a call that the 4R jumpseat would not retract. I asked if it had been secured retracted and was told it was not. Entered in logbook that seat was not secured in accordance with MEL. Later; [I] received another call that there was some misunderstanding. There had been an issue with a passenger seat during boarding; and the Purser thought this was what I had referenced in my brief. Since I wasn't there during boarding; I was unaware of this issue and it wasn't in the logbook; and none of the Flight Attendants were aware of the placarded Flight Attendant jumpseat. Apparently; the jumpseat had been secured with tape of the same color as the seat; and the tape had come loose so the seat was available for use; but it still did not retract properly. The appropriate passenger seat had been placarded for Flight Attendant use; but the Flight Attendant MANAGER; prior to boarding; had apparently assumed it was an unauthorized action by the Flight Attendants to obtain a crew rest seat; and removed the tape and placard. Hence; we departed using a placarded and malfunctioning Flight Attendant jumpseat. Once all this became known; the Flight Attendants secured the jumpseat as best they could and used the appropriate passenger seat for landing.,,,,Air Carrier Captain reports confusion among the cabin crew over a malfunctioning jumpseat that has been MEL'ed but not properly identified to the crew.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and the Flight Crew regarding a malfunctioning jumpseat on a commuter flight. The Flight Attendant identified a Maintenance Evaluation Log (MEL) issue with the 4R aft door Flight Attendant jumpseat, which was not retracting properly. According to the MEL, the seat needed to be secured, placarded, and the nearest passenger seat reserved for the Flight Attendant. Despite these requirements, the jumpseat was secured with tape of the same color as the seat, making it less visible, and the placard was removed by the Flight Attendant Manager, who believed it was unauthorized. This led to confusion among the cabin crew, as they were unaware of the issue and the proper procedures. Two hours into the flight, the jumpseat malfunctioned, prompting the crew to secure it and use an appropriate passenger seat for landing. The incident highlights the importance of proper communication and adherence to MEL procedures to ensure passenger and crew safety.",equipment malfunction

All takeoff bug speeds were verified in accordance with normal procedures. I was Captain and pilot flying. During takeoff roll; V1 auto-callout was announced by the aircraft 20 knots early. I eased back on the yoke and began rotation; when I realized I was below rotation speed. There was no pilot monitoring callout for rotation. I eased the nose of the aircraft back to the runway. I then rotated at the normal rotation speed and achieved approximately 10 degrees nose up at about 155-160 KTS. Everything else seemed normal. At 10;000 FT; after the sterile chime; a Flight Attendant asked me about the attempted rotation and set down. Her verbiage was approximately; 'What was that bump?' I explained what had happened and inquired if she heard any scraping. She said no. We pressurized normally and continued to our destination. At 3 hours into the flight (approximately); the flight attendants expressed concern that we had scraped the aircraft on takeoff; but were not sure. Upon receiving this new information; the copilot and I conducted the suspected tail-strike on takeoff portion of the QRH. We landed without declaring an emergency at our scheduled destination. After landing; and upon a post flight inspection; damage to the tail-skid was discovered. Dispatch and Chief Pilot were contacted.,,During preflight; I followed all normal procedures. The takeoff data V speeds did not automatically upload to the FMC. I manually inputted the correct V speed from the paperwork into the FMC. I verified they matched prior to pushback. There was no runway change from what I expected prior to pushback to what we received for our takeoff runway. During our takeoff roll; V1 was called early by the auto-voice. I think it was early by about 20 KTS. The Captain started a slow rotation. I knew it was too early; but was unsure of what procedure to advise him to stop rotation. I didn't want to say STOP or ROTATE for fear of confusion. He also recognized the problem shortly after I did and lowered the nose to the ground. Our takeoff then proceeded normally. After 10;000 FT; the Captain spoke with the Flight Attendant and she did not think there was a tail scraping during our takeoff. After about 3 hours more; the Flight Attendants decided we might have scraped some metal on takeoff. We did the QRH procedure for tail strike on takeoff and landed at our destination uneventfully. Because we suspected damage; we conducted a thorough exterior inspection and found some damage on the tail skid plate.,,A B737-800 Captain rotated 20 KTS below V1 when the autovoice V1 erroneously made the callout and then set down for a short period before rotating again. During the second rotation a tail strike occurred which flight attendants reported but the pilots did not immediately react to the report.,"The incident was triggered by an early V1 call from the auto-voice system during takeoff, prompting the Captain to rotate the aircraft prematurely. During takeoff, the Captain began rotating 20 knots below the required V1 speed due to the early call. Recognizing the issue, the Captain set the aircraft back down, then rotated again at the correct speed. Post-takeoff, a Flight Attendant inquired about a perceived bump, but the pilots initially ruled out any scraping. Three hours into the flight, the Flight Attendants expressed concern about potential damage, leading the pilots to consult the QRH for a tail strike. The aircraft landed safely, and a post-flight inspection revealed tail-skid damage. The aircraft sustained tail-skid damage but landed without emergency declaration. The incident highlighted the need for procedures to address early V1 calls and enhance crew communication during takeoffs. The investigation likely led to updated protocols for handling early V1 callouts and improving crew coordination to prevent similar incidents.",equipment malfunction

The Flight Attendant then attempted to remove power from the light; and being unable to do so; she then made the decision to employ and discharge a quick shot of halon in the associated light socket. I had asked the Captain if any warnings; cautions; or smoke alarms were activated on the EICAS or the lower lobe crew rest facility. He stated that there were no indications of any sort. Additionally there was no evidence of smoke permeating into the cabin and none of the passengers in the area of the rest facility reported smoke to the flight attendants who were on duty.,,The reading light in a B777's lower level crew rest area emitted a puff of smoke which a Flight Attendant then shot with halon. No fire or smoke sensors were activated.,"In a recent incident involving a B777 aircraft, a flight attendant detected a puff of smoke emanating from a reading light in the lower lobe crew rest area. Upon noticing this, the attendant discharged a halon fire extinguisher on the light fixture and promptly informed the cockpit. The captain acknowledged the situation and requested the attendant to turn off the light, though she was unable to do so. There were no alarms triggered in either the crew rest area or the cockpit, and subsequent investigation by the purser confirmed that the issue had been resolved. As a precaution, all flight attendants evacuated the lower lobe crew rest area. The captain then contacted maintenance, who recommended removing the faulty bulb. This was executed without complications. Maintenance logged a report regarding the incident, including the halon discharge. Both maintenance and dispatch concurred with the captain's decision to proceed to the planned destination. Throughout the remainder of the flight, flight attendants monitored the area, reporting no further issues.

It is very faint in flight.  I turned around and was prepared to keep the cockpit secure.  I saw that it was our First Flight Attendant.  He said that they had been trying to call us but the bells in the cockpit were not working.  We looked around and found that the handset at the back of the center console was slightly out of its cradle.  I was not aware that that silences all the call chimes in the cockpit.  We then had the flight attendants call us with the cockpit handset secured and off the hook and determined that it indeed does cut out the cockpit chimes when off the hook.  We flew on and landed as planned.  The flight was normal.  The man on the phone that asked for the report said there was some issue with my headset.  I don't know what that is about.  I was wearing the same headset that I have used for the last seven years; including all the check rides and flights with chief pilots and check airmen.  I have a noise canceling aviation headset.  It works great.  It protects my hearing and makes the HF radio clear and understandable.  It was plugged into the headset plugs in the airplane and I was monitoring 123.45 and 121.5.,The reporter states that the continuous chime announcing that the door unlock code had been entered was audible but not something that he had heard before and was therefore somewhat surprised when the cockpit door opened.,While in cruise; approximately 3 hours into flight; A Flight Attendant tried to check on our welfare; but we did not hear the inter phone chimes because the inter phone was not in its cradle properly or reset. Since there was no response from us; the Flight Attendant used the flight deck door code to enter the flight deck. I did not hear the door alarm. The cause of not hearing the flight deck inter phone chime was the improper cradling or reset of the hand set. Both myself and the First Officer were wearing head sets with both ears covered and I was listening to the HF radio and the common frequency for reports of turbulence; which I believe prevented us from hearing the door alarm.,,B757-200 flight crew is surprised to see the a Flight Attendant entering the cockpit to check on their welfare during a night flight over the Pacific.  The call bells were muted due to the handset not being in its' cradle and both pilots were wearing noise canceling headsets masking the door chimes.,"During a B757-200 flight over the Pacific, the flight crew was cruising at night when an incident occurred. The cause was identified as the cockpit handset being out of its cradle, which muted the call chimes. Additionally, the pilots were wearing noise-cancelling headsets, which prevented them from hearing the door alarm. The flight attendant attempted to contact the cockpit via interphone but received no response. As a result, the attendant used the door code to enter the cockpit. The pilots did not hear the door alarm, partly due to the headsets and their focus on monitoring the HF radio and common frequency. The incident was resolved when the crew secured the cockpit handset, restoring normal operations. The flight landed as planned without further issues. The proposed solution was to ensure the handset is properly secured to prevent similar occurrences.",equipment malfunction

Approx 5 min later First Officer received a call from the cabin that the passenger passed out in the Flight Attendant's arms and that they were searching for medical professional on board.  Before the First Officer was able to get any additional information the Flight Attendant that called hung up.  The First Officer briefed me on the current situation. I instructed him to prepare for a possible diversion.  I got the ops freq for him and we set the FMS for the diversion. I then took over ATC comm and instructed the First Officer to get more information from the Flight Attendants on the age/sex of passenger name or seat assignment etc in case we needed to make a medical phone patch call. While he was talking to the Flight Attendant I informed ATC of our situation and the possibility of diverting for an unknown medical situation with a passenger that has passed out in the cabin.  The First Officer got in touch with one of the Flight Attendant and received some basic information that the passenger was female; non English speaking; vomiting and abdominal pains with two RN's evaluating her. The Flight Attendant then hung up on the First Officer again.  The First Officer briefed me on the information he received and informed me that in his opinion that both Flight Attendants were in a panic. The First Officer and I discussed the situation and I instructed him that we were 45 min from landing in ZZZ2 or 10 min from ZZZ.  We both agreed we needed more info from the Flight Attendants and RN before beginning our diversion.  I received instruction from ATC to descend to FL320 and switch to another ATC controller.  I checked in with that ATC controller and advised him of the situation of a possible diversion to ZZZ after we received additional information from the cabin on the condition of the passenger. During my conversation with ATC I heard the First Officer inform the Flight Attendant that she needed to ask the RNs for more information on the condition of the passenger; needed a seat assignment at least; and to tell the RN's that we needed a decision whether to continue to ZZZ2 that will take 40 min or divert to ZZZ that will take 10 min. When the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant I informed him of our decent to FL 320 and switched to another center freq.  We again discussed the situation with the Flight Attendant and finished preparations for diversion to ZZZ.  First Officer got ATIS and we set up for landing on RWY 23 in ZZZ.  First Officer then received a call from the Flight Attendant with seat assignment of passenger and that the RN's agreed that it would be best to divert to ZZZ.  When I heard that on the Interphone I informed ATC of or need to divert to ZZZ for a medical emergency. ATC gave  us a left descending turn to direct ZZZ. I informed ATC that we wanted paramedics; ambulance to meet the Aircraft for a female passenger in her mid 30's with abdominal pains and vomiting. After the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant. I brief him of our ATC instructions; asked him to call the company and instruct them that we will be diverting to ZZZ for a medical emergency and to pass on the information to our dispatcher and that we will call him on the ground in ZZZ.  We then completed all checklist and when we contacted ZZZ Approach Control were given straight in to Rwy XX.  We landed 10 min after beginning our descent on Rwy XX and in the Gate; 2 min after landing.  Paramedics took the passenger off the plane and she was transported to a local hospital.  The First Officer suggested that he talk to the Flight Attendant's on the situation to evaluate whether we should continue the flight to ZZZ2 with them.  I agreed.  (First Officer is a certified paramedic) I contacted dispatch and gave him all the information I had and while I was on the phone with him I was handed thepassenger boarding stub with the passenger's name and passed it onto dispatch.  After I finished my call with Dispatch a Flight Attendant came up to the cockpit. I asked her if there was anything used as far as emergency equip the passenger. She informed me that just the stethoscope and blood pressure cuff out of the EEMK [Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit] were used and replaced into the kit.  The First Officer returned to the cockpit and informed me that he talked to both the Flight Attendants and they were more relaxed and he felt that they were capable to continue the flight to ZZZ2 and back to ZZZ.  A few min later Flight Attendant 1 brought up one of the Flight Attendant O2 bottles and informed me that they had to give the passenger O2 and that the bottle pressure was below 1500 psi. I was a little disgusted and informed her that it needed to be replaced or serviced before we can leave ZZZ. I told her that I needed to know all the equipment that was used for this passenger; and should have be told of this when I asked the first time. (Note at this time the paramedics had already removed the passenger and we had been on the ground for about 15 min.) I called Maintenance Control about the O2 bottle and later discussed swapping the O2 bottle with the other CRJ9 that was overnighting.  Contract Maintenance did show up at the aircraft and serviced the O2 bottle. After contract Maintenance had finished the servicing of the O2 bottle and took the maintenance logbook to sign off the writeup the first officer and I prepared the aircraft for departure.  The next two flights were uneventful.  After returning back to ZZZ for the overnight I was performing my shutdown checklist when the Flight Attendant presented me the inventory checklist for the EEMK [Emergency Medical Kit] and First Aid Kit.  I again was disgusted.  The EEMK showed that the all items were in the EEMK but she had checked that it was incomplete and serviceable. One of the First Aid Kits was used and the latex gloves were used and the kit was incomplete. I informed her that this inventory should have been completed before we left ZZZ for ZZZ2 and I should have been informed when I asked her if any emergency equipment was used of the O2 bottle and the latex gloves were used.  I then called Maintenance Control to defer the First Aid Kit and after discussing the EEMK with him he decided to defer both the EEMK and the First Aid Kit that were used.  I left the Aircraft at XA:30 local time.,,,,A CRJ diverted to a nearby airport in response to a passenger medical emergency.  The Captain expressed some concern about the professionalism of the Cabin Attendants' familiarity with the administrative aspects of the aircraft emergency equipment.,"The incident involved a CRJ aircraft diverting to a nearby airport due to a female passenger experiencing a medical emergency, including vomiting and abdominal pains. The flight crew received initial reports from the cabin about the passenger's condition, followed by a request for medical assistance. The cabin crew's communication was described as panicked, with incomplete information provided during initial contacts. The flight crew prepared for the diversion, informed air traffic control (ATC), and requested emergency services at the diversion airport. The aircraft landed at ZZZ, where paramedics transported the passenger to a hospital. Following the landing, the flight crew discovered that emergency oxygen equipment had been used and was not properly serviced. The Captain expressed concern over the cabin crew's handling of the situation and their communication regarding the use of emergency equipment. Maintenance was called to service the oxygen bottle and defer the First Aid Kit, which had been used during the incident. The flight crew also reviewed the inventory of the Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit (EEMK) and found discrepancies in its contents. The flight resumed to its final destination, with no further issues reported during the remainder of the journey. The incident highlighted concerns about the cabin crew's familiarity with administrative procedures related to emergency equipment usage and their communication during critical situations.",equipment malfunction

We cancelled the push and discovered the passenger had self-reported having the flu and being very ill. I made the decision to remove the Passenger and coordinated with customer service and Dispatch.   After landing; mid galley Flight Attendant reported that when she went to disarm door; she realized she had never re-armed the door after passenger removal. Flight Attendant filling out report. According to all (including mother and daughter of passenger who was removed); the passenger was visibly 'not well' by all accounts.  She never should have been allowed to board the airplane; particularly with all of the information available on influenza and public health risks. The distraction to the Flight Attendant caused by the return of the jetway and removal of the passenger caused a departure with door 2L unarmed. The increase in risk of not being able to get off the airplane in the event of an evacuation could have been avoided by a quick screening of the passengers boarding our airplanes.,,,,A Flight Attendant realized after arrival she had not armed a door because of distractions related to removing an ill passenger at departure time.,"An incident occurred during a flight involving a sick passenger with the flu. After receiving pushback clearance, the Ground Personnel were informed about the passenger's condition. The passenger was visibly unwell and reported having the flu, leading to the decision to remove them from the flight. This decision was coordinated with customer service and Dispatch. Upon landing, the Flight Attendant discovered that she had failed to re-arm door 2L due to distractions caused by the passenger removal process. This oversight posed a risk in the event of an evacuation. The incident highlighted the potential consequences of not adequately screening passengers for health risks, particularly concerning contagious illnesses like influenza. A quick passenger screening process was suggested to prevent similar incidents in the future.",equipment malfunction

The #2 engine's vibration gauge started to slowly increase into the abnormal range. We ran the QRH; and were only able to maintain the normal range at approximately 70% power setting. Because that thrust setting was too low to maintain cruise flight at FL 320; we determined it was necessary to divert to ZZZ. The flight continued with no other problems and a normal landing was accomplished. We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance to discuss the problem. After telling Dispatch where we were and that we needed an airport for diversion ZZZ was selected as the new destination airport and ATC was advised. An Emergency was declared. During the discussions; Maintenance Control advised us to follow the QRH and shut down the #2 engine. We asked multiple questions; but the only answer given was to follow the QRH. I asked the Maintenance Control person if he was even looking at the QRH for this problem and he admitted he wasn't. I asked him to reference the QRH with me. They still persisted to follow the QRH. We asked to speak with a Chief Pilot and the Program Manager; but our Dispatcher told us none were available and that a phone patch wouldn't work. During this conversation with Maintenance; we learned that the #2 engine had experienced this same problem the week before; and that the wrong engine had been fixed.  The rationale for our decision to forgo engine shutdown was the first caution note; printed in bold; in the QRH for Engine Fan Vibration which states; 'It is not recommended that an engine be shut down unless there is another indication of a severe engine abnormality; i.e; high oil temperature; high oil pressure or abnormal vibration is felt through the airframe.' All other engine gauges and parameters were normal and comparable to the left engine.  We did not feel any vibration through the air frame.  We also discussed that in the descent; the thrust would be back and would most likely remain in the normal range.  The descent was initiated for the diversion and we were able to control the vibration all the way to landing at ZZZ thus not needing an engine shut-down. Even though both the Captain and I had talked with the flight attendants about the diversion and possible engine problem; they never mentioned that the engine sounded louder than normal.  It wasn't until we were on the ground; that the aft Flight Attendant said that there was a louder than normal sound coming from the engine.  Recommendation Regarding Contract Maintenance. We decided not to fly the aircraft out of ZZZ due to multiple findings; including:  1) the fact that we couldn't verify the aircraft was legal to fly after corrective work had been performed on the wrong engine; 2) the very poor inspection done by contract maintenance. Even other ground crew personnel told us that they should not be trusted. It is our belief that the Contract Maintenance person never inspected the #2 engine. (We had questioned him how he looked at the blades and if he opened up the cowling.  He said he didn't open the cowling and that he had used the belt loader because a ladder wouldn't be tall enough to reach the engine.  We mentioned the belt loader was not on that side of the aircraft and he laughed and then stated 'You couldn't see anything from examining the blades anyway.'  (Yet he wrote in the corrective action of the log book that he inspected the blades).  The only time we were able to communicate with this person was when he finally came up to the cockpit for the run-up. After the run-up; he concluded that the engine was fine; and that we were good to go. Back at the gate; he took the maintenance book to sign off the engine; but had to come back and find out which engine we experienced trouble with. (This contradicts the fact he wrote that he inspected the blades. Had he inspected the blades; he would've known which engine had the vibe).  A decision to not use these contract maintenance personnel should be highly considered. Always get a Chief Pilot when requested.  We are encouraged from day one of CRM to utilize all our resources and we requested these resources but were denied access to them.  Maintenance Control often appears 'disengaged' to the problems the crew is encountering and the only answer they give to any questions for help or problem solving is 'Follow the QRH' even when presented with contradictory or unclear QRH procedures to follow.  Isn't maintenance there to help be a useful resource and problem solve?  Don't use this contract maintenance provider in the future.,,,,High engine vibration indications initiated an ongoing exchange with the commuter airline's dispatch and maintenance control organizations that the reporter deemed ineffective. Flight diverted and canceled,"The incident involved a flight crew encountering engine vibration issues, leading to a diversion and cancellation. After takeoff, the #2 engine's vibration gauge indicated abnormal levels, prompting the crew to follow the QRH. However, the suggested power settings were inadequate for cruising, necessitating a diversion to ZZZ. Communication with Maintenance Control was deemed ineffective, as they failed to provide meaningful assistance beyond directing the crew to adhere to the QRH. The crew elected not to shut down the engine, as the vibration was not severe enough, and successfully landed at ZZZ. Post-landing, the crew learned that a flight attendant had noticed a louder engine noise, which the crew had not detected. The crew identified multiple issues with the contract maintenance, including a prior incorrect engine repair and a lack of thorough inspection. The maintenance team's unprofessional conduct and inability to competently inspect the engine led the crew to cancel the flight from ZZZ. The crew recommended against using the contract maintenance provider and criticized Maintenance Control for its disengagement and lack of problem-solving support. The flight was ultimately diverted and canceled due to these maintenance and communication shortcomings.",equipment malfunction

Keypad has been deactivated - DOOR CANNOT BE OPENED BY PERSONNEL FROM CABIN SIDE. On board services: A. Flight Attendants must use Interphone to request cockpit access. B. EMERGENCY ACCESS FROM CABIN SIDE IS NOT AVAILABLE. C. cockpit two person rule must be observed.' I informed the purser of my concerns for SAFETY before briefing and he called maintenance.  He was informed that there is a code that the pilot can give for alternative access. I briefed with the Captain of any alternative ways for a SAFETY stand point and he stated that there is not any way to access the door under emergency basis at all. I didn't feel comfortable flying on a plane that I wasn't able to access the cockpit for emergency basis on for SAFETY. I called the crew desk immediately to inform them of my SAFETY concerns. I have been charged with a Did Not Fly action and delay of the aircraft for my SAFETY concerns. I hope that my safety issue is addressed for future administrative corrections and hope no one else will have to go through the difficulties that I feel I am being given to defend my integrity of being a SAFETY professional.,,,,A Flight Attendant reported concerns about lack of emergency cockpit access when the keypad entry system to the cockpit was deferred.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant who reported concerns regarding a safety issue related to cockpit access. The Flight Attendant noticed a maintenance defect on the keypad entry system to the cockpit, which was inoperative and rendered the cockpit door inaccessible from the cabin side. This raised safety concerns, as the Flight Attendant would be unable to access the cockpit in an emergency. The Flight Attendant informed the purser about their concerns, who then contacted maintenance. Maintenance responded by stating that the pilot could provide a code for alternative access, but during a briefing with the Captain, it was clarified that no such alternative access was available under emergency conditions. Uncomfortable with the safety risk, the Flight Attendant contacted the crew desk to report their concerns. As a result, the Flight Attendant was charged with a ""Did Not Fly"" action, leading to a delay in the aircraft. The Flight Attendant expressed hope that the safety issue would be addressed administratively to prevent similar situations in the future. In summary, the incident was caused by the inoperative keypad entry system, which raised safety concerns. The process involved the Flight Attendant reporting the issue, maintenance being contacted, and the Captain confirming the lack of emergency access. The result was a ""Did Not Fly"" action and aircraft delay, with the Flight Attendant advocating for future administrative corrections to address the safety concern.",equipment malfunction

Spoke to the Purser about this because there had been no information for passenger on oxygen on our briefing sheet. Later a passenger service representative boarded; letting us know that; indeed; we would have a passenger on oxygen. Fortunately; the agent had seen the passenger in the boarding area and saw that the passenger would not be using a nasal cannula but a trachea cannula instead. Everything on the aircraft had been incorrectly set up for a nasal cannula.  The agent redid the hoses and explained how to change the tanks.  The passenger was with his family and a paramedic in the boarding area but the paramedic was not allowed to board per a TSA officer even though the Captain had allowed it.  So; five minutes before departure the passenger is hastily boarded; along with his wife and 2 daughters who are traveling with him. I am given no additional/further medical information and am trying to communicate with people who speak limited English. One of the daughters questions me if the flight goes all the way to Vietnam. I tell her the flight number does but that everyone needs to deplane in VHHH. She becomes worried and says her father needs to stay on the oxygen and that they had been told that they wouldn't have to deplane. She makes a quick phone call and I speak to the Doctor. She is concerned about the VHHH stop because they had NOT been told about this. I assured them that they would have oxygen in VHHH and that everything was already taken care of because the computer booking would have alerted someone that this wasn't a nonstop flight. The doors were already closed at this time so I told the daughter that we would follow through and confirm with VHHH later on during the flight. I spoke with the Purser about this and we both felt it was important to follow up with VHHH because everything else related to our passenger had been very unorganized and mismanaged. Luckily; we had a Flight Attendant that spoke Vietnamese.  I asked her to speak to the family after takeoff and reassure them that the oxygen would have already been prearranged in VHHH.  Later; when the Vietnamese literate Flight Attendant was on her break; our passenger needed to use the bathroom.  I tried to communicate with the family to see how long he could be without oxygen and I couldn't really get a straight answer because of the language barrier. I erred on the side of caution and we strapped a portable oxygen bottle around the daughter who was assisting her father to the bathroom. The Purser had communicated to the cockpit the need for verification that we would have oxygen for the passenger in VHHH. Eventually; the cockpit received a message that the passenger had been advised in their PNR that there would be no oxygen in VHHH!!!!! And if they need it; it would be $250 USD. The Vietnamese speaker spoke to the family and they became a bit upset because here we are getting close to landing and we are making last minute arrangements for oxygen. Upon landing someone comes down the aisle with an aisle wheel chair and no oxygen. I had to forcefully let them know our passenger could not be moved without oxygen. The Purser; myself and a few of the economy flight attendants stayed on board for 40 minutes with the passenger and his family while company customer service representatives explained to the family that the price of the oxygen would be around $500 USD!!!!! This was due to the cost of a Doctor or Nurse needing to be there and there was a minimum charge for a set number of hours. The family became very distressed. The father was on his deathbed and this was his last flight so he could die in Vietnam and they had been given wrong information. It was devastating for us to see how poorly this family had been treated by our Company. More importantly; it was dangerous that someone didn't follow throughproperly. This family was basically shoved on the airplane without proper medical information ever being gathered and placed in his computer record and communicated to the crew.  Subsequently; the paramedic should have been allowed to board.  By to let the paramedic board; important medical information was not able to be conveyed to the crew due to the language barrier.,,,,A Purser relates her concerns about the services provided a passenger traveling with special medical needs.,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",equipment malfunction

They said that they could hear us but all I could hear was a clicking sound. I reported this to the cockpit. They responded that our destination did not have Maintenance. After landing the #2 and I ran downstairs for a quick smoke while the plane was being cleaned. Upon returning for boarding I asked the Captain about the communication problem. He once again stated that they don't have Maintenance here. I then asked him 'What if we have a problem in the back of the aircraft.' He replied 'I can hear you so I can click once for yes and twice for no.' I realized later how foolish I was not to have walked off the plane at that time. After takeoff the #2 got out her manual and of course there it was under malfunctions. 'Airline can not dispatch a flight if all cockpit cabin interphones are inoperative.' While deplaning at our destination I was the #2 talking on the Captain on the way off the plane. The only thing I said to him was 'It's a no-go item' as I left. I realize that everyone would like their trips to stay on schedule. What I do not understand is a cockpit crew willing to put both their flight crew and their passengers at risk. I thank God that there were not any problems on our return flight. I shudder to think what could have happened if we did.,,,,A MD80 Flight Attendant reported the Cockpit/Cabin interphone system was inoperative during flight. After landing; the Captain did not request contract Maintenance and the flight departed with a non-MEL item inoperative.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding the inoperative cockpit/cabin interphone system on an MD80 aircraft. The flight attendant reported that the interphone system was non-functional during the flight, as she could only hear a clicking sound and could not communicate properly with the cockpit. Despite her concerns, the captain stated that the destination did not have maintenance and that the flight could proceed. The flight attendant later discovered in the manual that the aircraft should not be dispatched if all interphone systems were inoperative. She raised this issue with the captain upon deplaning, emphasizing the risk to both the crew and passengers. The flight was operated with the interphone system inoperative, and no issues arose on the return journey. The attendant expressed frustration over the decision to proceed despite the risk, highlighting the potential dangers of such a situation.",equipment malfunction
