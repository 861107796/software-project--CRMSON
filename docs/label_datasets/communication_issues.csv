I also believe the agents were overzealous in enforcing the carry-on policy and the bag in question should have never been gate checked.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported a safety concern regarding the company's handling of gate checked bags that contain spare lithium-ion batteries and electronics with lithium-ion batteries.,"The incident arose from a security breach involving a gate-checked bag containing spare lithium-ion batteries. The flight attendant cited unclear company policies on lithium-ion batteries and excessive enforcement of carry-on policies by ground personnel as contributing factors. The flight attendant suggested that such bags should not be gate-checked, underscoring the importance of improved guidelines and staff training to prevent future breaches.",communication issues

We had been on this aircraft for 3 legs. The second leg was ZZZ1 to ZZZ flight. I had notice the door; closing on a swift swing than a slight click for closure. I was uncomfortable with that and reopened and closed the door. On; the next flight; ZZZ to ZZZ1; we rushed boarding; with a full flight and a jump seater. I had done my drink orders. Boarding was complete and the Captain said it was ok to close the MC (Main Cabin) door. After flight attendant B said cross check; I didn't feel like the MC door had closed completely. So; I asked; the Captain if the flight deck indicator said my door was locked and he replied no. I was thinking I needed to resecure the door. In feeling a time limit; I rushed to open the door it felt heavy and I felt the resistance so I only cracked it before I saw a little part of the grey slide appearing.  I stopped opening  the door and told the captain. The Captain was trying to communicate to the jet bridge driver and calling the necessary people and the jet bridge driver and supervisor did the same.  I noticed the  door was armed; when the airport managers came over and took pictures. The Captain made a PA. Passengers calmly deplaned by 2L door with their belongings and went to the boarding area at the next gate. No one was hurt or injured; When we reached the gate area we were met with  appropriate authorities per procedures. After the debrief  the Captain and I realized that we had a miscommunication about the door. Thankfully;the slide was not fully deployed until the passengers were off the aircraft.,,Boarding had been completed and I was ensuring compliance while waiting for A FA (Flight Attendant) to close door.  After the initial complaint check my A FA made PA to prepare doors for departure and cross check.  I armed the L2 door; verified it was armed and crossed to R2 door and did the same.  I made the PA that cross check was complete and cabin was ready for push back. I picked up demo equipment and started to walk towards the front of cabin when I received a call from A FA; they told me that they blew the L1 slide. Then the captain and airport officials coordinated deplaning from the L2 door. Once air stairs were in place; my disarmed door was opened by a Gate Agent and we deplaned all passengers.,,Flight Attendants reported the A Flight Attendant deployed the escape slide at the gate while attempting to close the main cabin door.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant attempted to close the main cabin door, mistakenly deploying the escape slide. The cause stemmed from the Flight Attendant's concern about the door's closure, which led her to reopen and check it. During this process, the slide deployed. The Flight Crew and airport officials coordinated the safe deplaning of passengers using the L2 door and air stairs. The result was a successful, injury-free evacuation. The debrief highlighted a miscommunication regarding the door status, leading to the incident. No explicit solution was proposed, but the situation was managed effectively, with the crew learning from the miscommunication.",communication issues

The cause was attributed to poor training among the Ground Personnel, leading to the forced surrender of lithium-ion batteries and their placement in the cargo hold. Despite the Flight Attendant's attempt to explain that they were within carry-on limits and that the bag contained necessary manuals, the situation remained unresolved. The summary highlights the conflict arising from regulatory enforcement and the resulting actions taken by the Ground Personnel.",communication issues

I then noticed fire trucks beside us. I had no idea about anything happening until the flight deck door opened and then I heard some things...I was then told that we had a pressure issue and we had [requested priority handling]. To my surprise; I was taken back and waited until I could talk to the Captain after passengers deplaned. We (passengers and I) didn't have any indications of a problem and O2 masks did not deploy at any time during the flight. A few passengers asked why the fire trucks were there and I could not answer them. After everyone was gone and the Captain was off the cell and did paperwork on the aircraft; I asked him what happened.

The flight attendant observed fire trucks and was informed of the issue after passengers had disembarked. The captain later explained the pressurization problem but apologized for not informing the attendant, attributing the lapse to being too occupied. The flight attendant experienced poor communication from the flight crew, resulting in unanswered passenger inquiries about the emergency vehicles. The outcome highlighted a communication breakdown between the flight attendant and the pilot crew.

Between ZZZ1 and ZZZZZ Captain did a normal system monitor check. Upon looking at the COND page; he noticed the AFT Cargo Temp at 180 degrees (Steady Green); asked me if I had seen a temp that high; I replied No! We kept an eye on it; over the next 10 minutes; noticed it rising to 188 degrees; then 194 degrees (still Steady Green) where it stayed for the duration of the flight. This made us uncomfortable for normal Cargo Bay temperatures in my 3;000+ hours flying this aircraft at 2 different airlines have never exceeded cabin temperatures during cruise. We simultaneously started looking into what could be a catastrophic problem. I got into the QRH AOM/FOM/and other manuals to look for temperature limitations and fixes. I found none; anywhere. During the same time; Captain got on the Phone with Operations and phone patched to Maintenance Control; where they attempted multiple resets to no success. When Captain got off the phone with Maintenance; he said; 'Well nothing fixed It; and they (Maintenance) said we are on our own.'At that point; we agreed as a crew that we didn't know what was going on down there. We were both not comfortable taking an aircraft with this indication over water; with limited divert options to an international location; and with no company or Contract Maintenance at the destination not knowing what was going on down there. The indication was steady at this point; not rising higher [than] 194 degrees; nor giving any other indications to the back when we notified the Flight Attendants and told them what was going on. At this point; we felt we were not in a land as soon as possible scenario; but in a land as soon as practical scenario but keeping land as soon as possible options available and we decided to divert to ZZZ2. We gave ATC a PAN PAN call since we were going to a divert airport that wasn't our alternate but that we were not at the time an emergency aircraft; we just wanted to have all our bases covered. We notified Dispatch both via phone patch and ACARS. During descent we were cleared the ZZZZZ Arrival to ZZZ2.We were still grossly overweight with a lot of gas; so we referenced the overweight Checklist. With that; we decided that with the condition still not worsening from what had been continuously indicated with no secondary indications or issues coming from the cabin; Captain and I both agreed that in an effort not to compound the problem we should hold to burn down gas; but having immediate [landing] options nearby; so we held at ZZZZZ1 at 16;000 ft. for 30-40 min and got to a calculated weight that would put us on deck in ZZZ2 right at Max landing weight. We continued to ZZZ2 via the arrival; for an uneventful Runway XX landing. On a side note; the XX transition from the ZZZZZ Arrival is a bit of a slam dunk. We asked for a bit longer final to get down; stabilized; and situated; and ATC approach gave us a few last second altitude; headings; and speed amendments through final which started to task saturate us as we prepared for landing. For example: open descent from 6;000-3;000; we were told to amend altitude and maintain 4;000 ft. while passing 4;200 feet; thrust idle; and speed brakes out. We blew through the altitude and had to climb back up Auto Pilot off; ALT horn blaring; and engines spooling up to 80+%; and getting speed brakes back in. We were also given several headings through final; and were asked to slow to final approach speed 10 plus miles outside the final approach fix at 4;000 feet; and approach didn't give us an approach clearance until we had flown through the glide slope on the localizer; and had to join from above; in order to sequence aircraft landing [Runway] XYL; which started to compound our landing configuration planning; and a go around was not something we were hoping to do; especially off of a PAN PAN call. We later found that on a couple of occurrences; ATC did not pass the PANPAN or divert info from Center to Center to Approach. We were later reassigned upon arrival to fly a ZZZ3 Turn that left in 5 minutes.I told Company that we just went through a lot; and that if they wanted us to fly that turn; that I needed a break for an amount of time that I was setting; some food; and so the Captain and I went and had a sit down meal; decompressed; talked about what had happened; after an hour or so I assessed my fitness for duty and felt I was good to fly the turn. The Captain and I were sitting on the jet; and when we called for push going to ZZZ3; Ramp told us to hold and that Maintenance wanted to talk to us. The maintenance team member got on the radio; asked if we were the crew that brought Aircraft X in from ZZZ; I replied yes; and he told us we needed to fill out a fume report. Captain asked what he was talking about; and told him this was the first we have heard about any fume incident. The Maintainer on the radio said the Flight Attendants had filed a fume report after the flight; and we needed to do the same. The Flight Attendants never told us anything about fumes nor their intent to fill out any such reports. Captain then filed a fume report said he had no information to give for we knew nothing about it. I felt Captain had communicated very clearly what was going on to the flight attendants about the situation; and our intent to divert. They had never communicated any such issues during any duration of or after the flight. Unknown from the high temperature in the Aft Cargo Bay. We did later saw that Maintenance replaced the sensor in the aft cargo bay via the app. We were curious that with all the ZZZ team members in Training vests if maybe they stacked the bags in the aft cargo bay above the line and possibly covered the sensor or did something to It. However; As far as the 'suspected' fume event; there was no communication from the flight attendants to the cockpit crew for this event. We noticed via the app that Maintenance later deferred the APU to prevent 'further fume events' due to the suspected fume event we were later notified about from ZZZ2 Maintenance. Not sure why if there is a fume event (or even a suspected fume event) why they don't further investigate the problem or fix the problem; rather than just pencil whip it into deferment. If there was any fumes in this situation; how would MX (Maintenance) know they came from the APU and not from any potential problem we were encountering? Put quick reference limitations on a Cockpit Card or in the QRH or checklist to quickly reference for situations such as these. I felt like we were on an Easter egg hunt for something that we later found wasn't there which wasted a lot of our decision making time. I know that Airbus FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) and other manufacture manuals/reference material has such limitations for quick reference from my experience at a previous Airbus airline. Why can't the company get on board with Airbus??? Make sure Flight Attendants communicate to the cockpit if they were smelling fumes.,,,,A321 First Officer reported an abnormally elevated Aft Cargo Bay temperature during cruise. After conferring with maintenance; the flight executed a precautionary diversion for maintenance.,"The incident involved an A321 flight crew (Party 1) and a flight attendant (Party 2). During the flight, the crew noticed an abnormally high aft cargo bay temperature (194 degrees), which was above standard operating parameters. The crew consulted manuals and contacted maintenance but found no immediate solution. Concerned about the situation, particularly over water with limited diversion options, the crew decided to divert to ZZZ2. They made a PAN PAN call to inform ATC and contacted dispatch. During descent and landing at ZZZ2, the crew encountered challenges with overweight landing conditions and ATC communication, but the landing was uneventful. Post-landing, maintenance informed the crew that a fume report had been filed by the flight attendants, though the crew had no prior knowledge of fumes or related issues during the flight. Maintenance deferred the APU to prevent further fume events. The crew expressed concerns about the lack of communication from the flight attendants regarding the suspected fume event and questioned the adequacy of maintenance's response. They recommended improved communication protocols between the cockpit and cabin crew, better access to quick reference materials for such situations, and a more thorough investigation of potential issues instead of deferred fixes.",communication issues

The FA (Flight Attendant) then found room for the bag in the cabin and the Ops Agent went and grabbed the bag from below the wing. After we left; we were informed that the bag was brought back up to the cabin. During cruise I asked the A-Flight Attendant to come up to the cabin and showed him in the book where it says you cannot do that. The B-FA also informed the A of the error.I believe I should have been more involved with the bag; I thought the bag was being dealt with by Ground Ops properly.

The smart bag was relocated to passenger cabin prior to gate departure.,"The incident arose from a miscommunication between the flight captain and a flight attendant regarding the handling of a smart bag. Contributing factors included the inexperience of the new ops agent and flight attendant, as well as the captain's distraction while retrieving food, leading to a lack of direct involvement in the bag's handling. The flight attendant initially gate-checked the smart bag, which was later identified as requiring special handling. The ops agent retrieved the bag from the cargo area after being notified. During the flight, the captain noticed the bag in the cabin and pointed out the policy violation. The flight attendant acknowledged the mistake, and the bag's handling was corrected. The smart bag was erroneously loaded into the cargo compartment but was later moved to the passenger cabin. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and involvement by the captain, especially when dealing with safety-sensitive items like smart bags. The captain reflected on the need to be more involved in the handling of such items and recognized the impact of new staff and distractions on communication.

Aircraft deplaned normally. 1st was unaware there was an issue 4th thought it was an electrical odor 2nd stated there was an odor but not a burning odor. He noticed a lite haze in the reading lights. [The possible cause] was primarily due to the dark cabin; communications among cabin crew. In a perfect world; there would have been better communication between all of the flight attendants; prior to calling up the flight deck.

The incident began when the fourth flight attendant (FA4) detected an odor and reported smoke, suspecting it might be electrical. The flight crew, led by the captain, halted the aircraft and assessed the situation. The captain noticed a brief whiff of something, while the first officer detected nothing. They contacted ground control and requested the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) team. The flight crew considered their checklist for smoke/fumes but sought more information. Upon contacting the cabin, FA1 reported no smoke or odor, while FA2 noted a dissipating odor and a light haze in the reading lights. The captain, after consulting with the first officer, decided to proceed to the gate for ARFF evaluation. The aircraft landed smoothly, and passengers deplaned normally. The event highlighted the challenges of communication among cabin crew in a darkened cabin. The suggested improvement was enhanced communication to ensure a more informed and coordinated response, allowing for a clearer assessment and more efficient information transfer to the flight deck.

I (FA) contacted the terminal Supervisor who patched me through to Agent; in the tower. I told him of our plight and passenger complaints and concerns. He said he would send someone immediately to turn on the air. This was approximately 20 minutes later. About 15-20 minutes later we still had no air. Passengers were getting very upset and many took their masks off. We made announcements stating that without airflow; it was even more important to keep their mask on since they could not social distance. I contacted the Supervisor again and insisted the passengers be let off the aircraft if we were not going to get airflow and we still didn't know anything about when the pilots would arrive. Approximately 10 minutes later the pilots boarded and stated we should never have begun boarding under those conditions. They got air up and we departed 15 minutes later. 1 hour and 10 minutes after boarding. I felt very; very unsafe in those conditions as did many passengers.We should never board without air conditioning during COVID. If the pilots are running late; a mechanic should be brought down to turn on the air. A few minutes would be acceptable but when the tower is contacted; something should be done in a timely manner.

I had assumed that while I was tending to this passenger she had took over all of my duties and she assumed that I was going to finish my duties once I got back up into the gallery. I also believe the pilots close the door on their own to keep warm which is why we had gotten confused on the door being close.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being distracted by a disruptive passenger and forgetting to advise the flight crew the cabin was secure and they were ready to depart.,"The incident involved a misunderstanding between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding the cabin security process. The flight attendant was distracted by a disruptive passenger who refused to wear a mask, leading to an oversight in communication. After addressing the passenger, the flight attendant assumed the flight crew had been informed that the cabin was secure. Similarly, the flight crew believed the flight attendant had communicated the cabin's readiness. This mutual assumption resulted in the cabin not being properly secured before the safety briefing began. Approximately one minute into the briefing, the captain noticed the lack of communication and informed the flight attendant, prompting both parties to re-secure the cabin promptly. The incident was attributed to the distraction caused by the disruptive passenger and the crew's assumption that the other party had handled their respective duties.

I did a positive exchange of controls to the Captain since it was my PF (Pilot Flying) leg. He took controls as normal. Door unlocked and the crew swap went normal. Upon finishing in the lavatory the B FA called up to begin the next crew exchange. She informed me that the CA wanted to use the lavatory too. I was waiting in the galley expecting the A FA to come out so we could do the normal process of me sitting down; getting controls back; getting any flight updates; and then having the FA's call back up so the CA could use the lav. Instead; the flight deck door opened and out walked the CA. No one was at the controls; the A FA was in the process of moving from my seat to the CA seat. I immediately said 'she's supposed to come out first; no one is at the controls'. The CA responded 'oh; right' or something along those lines. The B FA and myself expressed our concerns over the incorrect lavatory exchange procedure. He then proceeded to open the lavatory door. Not go back into the flight deck. I rushed into the flight deck; sat down; got myself situated and locked the door since there was no pilot. I got the aviate; navigate done and now wanted to communicate. I asked the A FA what happened and she said 'I don't really know; he told me to switch seats with him so we squeezed past each other'. I told her that's not normal and that I needed to talk to the CA. The B FA called up; said the code word; and the CA came back in. I talked to him about what happened and he said something like 'oh right; that did seem strange'. I talked to him about the correct procedure which he; I assume; did not know. I told him we had no one at the controls and how dangerous that is. Upon getting to the hotel the FA's asked me if I was going to fill out a report. I called the Pilot Union Professional Standards to get their opinion on the situation. I used this as a teaching moment; however; the whole event should never have happened.,,,,First Officer reported that during a lavatory break; both pilots were out of the cockpit at the same time and the flight attendant was swapping seats in the cockpit; leaving the aircraft uncontrolled.,"The incident occurred during a flight when the First Officer (FO) and Captain (CA) were both absent from the cockpit, leaving the aircraft uncontrolled. The First Officer had informed the Captain of the need to use the lavatory, and the flight attendants (FAs) were expected to manage the cockpit exchange. However, during the crew swap, the flight deck door was opened, and the Captain entered the cockpit while no pilot was seated at the controls. Simultaneously, the A FA was in the process of moving from the FO's seat to the Captain's seat, creating a dangerous situation. The FO returned to the cockpit, retook control, and addressed the unsafe procedure with the Captain. The B FA also expressed concerns about the improper exchange. The incident was reported to the Pilot Union Professional Standards, and the FO used it as a teaching moment to emphasize the importance of proper cockpit procedures. The event highlights a critical lapse in safety protocols and underscores the need for adherence to established procedures.",communication issues

We were confused by this question because we had been uniformed of any issues regarding our flight. Then he proceeded to tell us that there was an air quality issue with that aircraft. We were even more confused as to why we were not made aware of this issue and wanted confirmation or at least more information about what we were dealing with. He then left us and we began communication with CSS (Cabin Service System); and tried to contact a Supervisor. We then learned that it was in fact our aircraft; and they were now tail swapping it out of service. I am unclear on what we should be doing; if we should be concerned for our health; or be tested? I was under the impression that the Supervisor who first approached us would return with more information or at least confirm that it was our flight. I am not feeling well; but I am unsure now if I was already getting sick; or if it was caused or exasperated by this aircraft. I feel like we have been blindsided with some potentially health threatening news and left with no guidance.We need someone to be following up with us about what's going on and what the exact report entails so we can make an educated decision on how to proceed and weather to be tested or not.,,,,Air carrier flight attendants reported an 'air quality' issue after deplaning the aircraft.,"The flight attendant was approached by a supervisor after landing who informed them about an air quality issue with their aircraft. The attendant was confused as they had no prior notice and sought more information, which they obtained through the Cabin Service System. They learned their aircraft was being replaced. The attendant expressed concerns about their health, unsure if their illness was due to the aircraft or pre-existing.

They catered the front next. Upon completing catering; and when the R1 door was closed; I noticed that the warning strap was across the window. I immediately called it out and said 'why is that strap across the window'? The door was obviously disarmed as there was no slide deployment. D Flight Attendant was with me. The CSA (Customer Service Associate); who was waiting at the R1 door; then said 'you gave the caters a thumbs up when they knocked and the strapped was attached' which I do not recall doing. D Flight Attendant didn't see the warning strap in the armed position when she boarded the plane either. I immediately moved the warning strap to the disarmed position and noticed that the velcro strap on the extension piece was worn out to the point where the extension would not stay attached. It constantly fell down and hung.I told the First Officer as she was leaving the flight deck that we had an issue with the R1 warning strap. She indicated that they were about to time out and discounted my comment. I made her look at the strap. She came to the door and said 'no; it works; see'. I showed her that 4/5 attempts to place the strap on the Velcro didn't work; it would fall down. She said 'well you gotta talk to the Captain about it' and then entered the bathroom. I then proceeded to talk to the Captain. He stopped me before I even started and said 'if you tell me anything I am obligated to put it in the book; so is this really important?' I said yes; I have an issue with the warning strap. He also indicated that they had a timing issue and couldn't take any delays. I told them that I needed Maintenance. Maintenance came and fixed the strap. I don't know what happened with the strap being across the window in the armed position. I can only speculate that catering attached it while it was hanging down. If it was in place; they shouldn't have opened the door; the CSA should have also said something as she was waiting by L1; apparently watching; and the entire inbound crew should have checked upon deplaning. I find it odd that all of these checks would have been missed. Furthermore; I didn't appreciate being put in a position where I had to make the call if we were going to take a potential delay and possibly cancel the flight due to a timing out issue. My only job is to bring cabin discrepancies to the captain's attention. This was a poor example of CRM. This morning; I had a conversation with the Captain regarding the events yesterday and reiterated what I have written in this [report]; about poor CRM and putting me in an uncomfortable situation. He agreed and said they handled the situation poorly. As we are flying together today on an ETOPS flight to ZZZ; I didn't want to there be any communication issue before we left. Our conversation was pleasant and we cleared the air.,,,,Flight attendant reported a CRM issue developed with the flight deck crew after reporting there was a minor maintenance issue with an aircraft door.,"The incident arose from a maintenance issue with the R1 door warning strap, which the Flight Attendant noticed during cleaning. She reported the strap was improperly positioned and highlighted worn Velcro causing instability. Despite the First Officer and Captain dismissing her concerns initially, the Flight Attendant persisted, leading to Maintenance being called, who subsequently repaired the strap. The situation highlighted shortcomings in CRM, prompting a later discussion between the Flight Attendant and Captain, resulting in a commitment to improve communication and address such issues more effectively.",communication issues

The aircraft was put on a hardstand with no tug where with guidance from the ramp crew we would be able to start both engines and be directed to the movement area of the ramp. After completing the Engine Start Check; I looked over to the Ramper and with their permission; I released the parking brake. I however; did not reengage the parking brake. I then directed the First Officer to start both engines. The number 2 engine was started first. Following the start of the number 1 engine; the First Officer stepped on the brakes and simultaneously engaged the parking brake. This caused the airplane to stop abruptly. I asked the First Officer why he did what he did; and he said that we were moving. I then said that it was my mistake for not having the parking brake engaged; but we were moving slowly and we were far from any equipment and people. I then asked the First Officer two questions Why did he not say to me that the aircraft was moving and I would have applied the brakes and why did he apply both the brakes and the parking brake at the same time ? He said that he was not sure the brakes alone would have stopped the airplane. We then proceeded with the rest of the normal checklists and taxied to the runway and departed. In flight; the Flight Attendant said she was injured from the whiplash and was bruised. She said she may see a doctor upon reaching our destination. At the end of the flight I exchanged my contact information with the Flight Attendant to keep me informed of her physical condition. The whole sequence of events started with me not engaging the parking brake after releasing it for the out time. The threat of not recognizing that we do not have rampers to tell us to reset the brake after push was not addressed during our threat discussion and mitigation. My error was not seeing the airplane moving after the number one engine started and stopping the airplane before the First Officer. The undesired state was the fact that the aircraft moved when it should not have causing potential harm to the ramp crew and outside equipment. The other error I would say was CRM. The First Officer acted in the interest of safety and was the first to recognize the movement of the aircraft. He however over reacted. Based on the fact the airplane was moving slowly and we were far from rampers and equipment; I think he should have told me that we were moving and I would have stopped the airplane. If I did not react he then should have stepped on the brakes. This was the error on CRM our part. After talking to him I found out that he just finished IOE recently and this was his first trip after completing IOE. I think lack of experience in actual line operations caused him to act the way he did. I also should have checked with the Flight Attendant to see how she was doing after the airplane came to a stop. What I learned was to be extra vigilant when you are taxiing out with no towbar from the gate. If we were close to people or equipment; this could have been bad. Addressing ramp operations with no tug driver telling you to 'set the brake' is a threat that we should have discussed and talked about. I also need to be more aware of aircraft (unintentional) movement in all situations and react appropriately.,,,,ERJ145 Captain reported the parked aircraft began rolling on the ramp and the First Officer put the brakes on and the parking brake causing an abrupt stop injuring a Flight Attendant.,"The incident involved an ERJ145 aircraft during its morning flight. The captain released the parking brake but failed to re-engage it, causing the aircraft to move on the ramp after the engines were started. The first officer, noticing the movement, applied both the brakes and the parking brake, resulting in an abrupt stop. A flight attendant sustained injuries from the sudden stop, including whiplash and bruising. The primary causes of the incident were the captain's oversight in not re-engaging the parking brake after releasing it and the first officer's overreaction to the aircraft's movement. The captain acknowledged a lapse in vigilance during ramp operations without proper communication from ground staff and attributed the first officer's actions to his recent completion of initial operating experience (IOE), indicating a lack of line operation experience. The captain learned the importance of being more vigilant when taxiing without a tug and emphasized the need to address ramp operation threats during pre-flight briefings. Additionally, the incident highlighted the importance of effective crew resource management (CRM) and clear communication to prevent similar occurrences.",communication issues

Then as I observed him from back of aircraft; as soon as he got to his row he took off his mask and put it in his uniform jacket. I came forward and asked him if he needed another mask and he said; 'No; I have one.' I asked him to please put it on. He complied until I walked past him; then took it off again. I mentioned it to our Purser. As she was doing cabin compliance checks with me prior to closing main cabin door; Purser again had to ask him to; 'Please put on mask again.' He complied at that point.,,,,Flight Attendant reported catering personnel were not wearing masks; and a non-revenue pilot was not complying with mask usage until pilot was asked twice to comply.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant observed two policy violations during the flight. First, catering personnel were not wearing masks, which contravened company health and safety protocols. Second, a non-revenue pilot was initially non-compliant with mask-wearing requirements. The flight attendant addressed the pilot, who initially refused but complied temporarily. Upon the attendant leaving, the pilot removed his mask again. The Purser intervened, reminding the pilot to wear his mask, to which he finally complied. The catering issue was reported but not resolved during the flight. The result was the pilot's compliance after two reminders, while the catering staff's non-compliance was noted but addressed through reporting.",communication issues

During the boarding process; the forward FA asked me if it was okay if a passenger moved from the aft of the aircraft to the front of the aircraft. I told her it was okay with me if she was comfortable with doing so; but that was the last communication that we had. After takeoff; I had a sudden realization that the passenger may have moved and that the passenger data/distribution from the auto-closeout may differ from our actual passenger distribution; therefore affecting the accuracy of our weight and balance and manifest. I had the FO call back to the FAs; who confirmed that the passenger did in fact move. After landing; the FA told me that she did not realize that we needed the updated passenger locations for our manifest/weight and balance numbers. This event was caused by a lack of communication by both parties. By not closing the communication loop; there was information that was not conveyed correctly and therefore caused a breakdown. The lack of further information from the FA led me to the assumption that the passenger was not moved; whereas in her opinion I had given her the OK to do whatever she needed to do and there was no need to report back with any changes. Additionally; we are so used to flights being full and the auto-close out process being so automated; that moving passengers is a relatively new occurrence that none of us were necessarily expecting; but that we should be aware of and expect to occur more in the future.During unprecedented times such as these where passenger loads are extremely light and the need to distance passengers may be necessary; and where the weight and balance process is now very streamlined and automated; it would be a great reminder for all crewmembers to be aware of the necessity to maintain accurate record of passenger location; and update the data in the MCDU to reflect where passengers are actually seated if it differs from the auto close-out data. Explaining to flight attendants the importance of this communication (having an accurate manifest and subsequently weight and balance data) may help all parties understand the importance of making these changes. I personally plan on briefing the crew during particularly empty flights; that they need to report any passenger seating changes to me prior to departure.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported that the aircraft departed with passenger distribution data different from the actual distribution due to one passenger changing seats. The Captain noted the aircraft was very lightly loaded and it was important to ensure an accurate record of passenger location; as this could affecting weight and balance data.,"The incident involved an aircraft departing with passenger data that did not match the actual seating arrangement due to a passenger changing seats. The cause was a lack of communication between the flight crew and the flight attendant. During boarding, the forward flight attendant had asked the Captain if a passenger could move from the aft to the front, receiving permission. However, there was no follow-up communication. After takeoff, the Captain realized the passenger had moved, leading to discrepancies in weight and balance data. The flight operations officer (FO) confirmed the move with the flight attendants. Post-landing, the flight attendant explained she hadn't realized the need to update the data. The proposed solution is for the Captain to brief the crew on the importance of accurate passenger data and communication, especially on low-load flights.",communication issues

The flight attendant suggested moving the concerned passenger to an exit row to create distance, but this was complicated by another passenger in the exit row who had removed their mask while eating. The passenger in seat X became agitated, stating that it was unacceptable that mask-wearing was not being enforced. Despite the flight attendant's request for both passengers to wear masks, the passenger in seat X refused. The flight attendant then informed the other flight attendant and the pilots.

The FO assured FA1 that the temperature would be adjusted and instructed her to call back if the issue persisted. The airflow and temperature in both the flight deck and cabin subsequently returned to normal, and the flight continued to its destination, ZZZ1, without further incident. Following the flight, the Captain discovered evidence of a bird strike on the right engine during the post-flight walk-around, including feathers embedded in the bypass fan blades and core compressor blades. During the ride to the hotel, other flight attendants (FA2, FA3, and FA4) reported that they had called FA1 during the initial climbout and detected smells resembling ""burnt chicken,"" ""cooked chicken,"" or a ""burnt bird strike"" odor. However, FA1 only described the smell as ""dirty socks"" when contacting the flight deck. The Captain emphasized that had he been aware of the more specific descriptions provided by the other flight attendants, his decision to continue to ZZZ1 might have been different, as the smells could have indicated a more serious issue such as engine damage or failure. The Captain highlighted the importance of clear and accurate communication among all crew members. He suggested that flight attendants should relay specific and precise observations to the flight deck to ensure that potential issues are fully understood and addressed. This could prevent more serious consequences, such as engine failure or other safety risks.",communication issues

I quickly apologized for our crew in missing this during boarding; but that the infant car seat that was rear facing had to be moved for taxi; takeoff and landing phases of flight to be at the window. I again apologized (infant was at the time being held by mom and not in the car seat itself; but again it was in the middle) and he agreed to move it for landing and said he understood as I explained that if in an evacuation it was blocking his wife from exiting.Fast forward to descent and 18;000 feet I again told the guest that we needed to move the car seat to the window; where his words soon became a bit more on the combative side. I continued to firmly stand my ground with moving the car seat for landing and was safest for all as well as a rule I was unwilling to budge on. He was upset that it wasn't said to him prior to takeoff and I agreed with him we should have caught the issue prior; but sometimes these things happen and we are required to fix them as we see them.During this social distancing and mask wearing time in our country; there are a lot of emotions and scare while flying for some. During boarding a through flight with multiple little incidents adds up and human error can happen with missing individual situations. Again the car seat was something that should not have been missed but it does happen on occasion and once it was noticed airborne we mentioned it to the passenger and had him move it for landing.,,,,Air carrier flight attendant reported a passenger was upset with being told to comply with regulations regarding their child seat. Flight Attendant suggested many passengers seem more stressed than usual because of COVID-19 pandemic procedures.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a flight attendant noticed an infant car seat placed in the middle of the seating area during the beverage service. The flight attendant apologized for missing the car seat during boarding and requested that it be moved to the window seat for safety reasons, as rear-facing car seats must be positioned there during takeoff, taxi, and landing. The passenger, initially cooperative, became increasingly combative during descent when the attendant repeated the request. The flight attendant emphasized the safety regulations and the importance of compliance, while the passenger expressed frustration over not being informed of the requirement prior to takeoff. Despite the conflict, the passenger eventually moved the car seat to the window as instructed. The flight attendant acknowledged the passenger's concerns but reiterated that such situations can arise despite efforts to address them during boarding. The incident was resolved with the car seat in compliance, though the passenger remained upset. The synopsis notes that the pandemic has increased stress and anxiety among passengers, potentially contributing to the tension.",communication issues

He was rowdy at the beginning of the flight but did not cause any issues until he began throwing almonds at a passenger 2 seats away; when asked to stop he did. He was then asked multiple times through the flight by both FA A & B to put his mask on. He would comply when asked or when we were walking by but would take it off as soon as he thought we could no longer see. I reminded him that it was a policy; he then all at once told me he had some sort of test done and if that wouldn't work what about a medical condition so that he wouldn't haven't to wear the mask. I asked him if he had spoken to a gate agent about it which he threatened me; telling me that I didn't want to go there with him because I wouldn't win.

The passenger initially boarded the plane without a mask but complied after being asked. The passenger was initially rowdy but did not cause significant issues until he began throwing almonds at another passenger. When asked to stop, he complied. However, throughout the flight, the passenger repeatedly removed his mask despite being asked multiple times by the flight attendant and another crew member. When the passenger attempted to argue against wearing the mask, claiming he had a test done and possibly a medical condition, the flight attendant questioned whether he had discussed this with a gate agent. The passenger responded with a threat, implying the flight attendant would not win. The flight attendant then contacted the cabin manager and informed the passenger that the mask policy was non-negotiable, leading to the passenger being met at the gate upon deplaning. After exiting the plane, the flight attendant felt unsafe due to a group of older and large men traveling with the disruptive passenger.

The Y year old doesn't have to wear one.  This FA obtained two for her from the galley. She had found hers. The Y year old yelled out he wants one so was given one. During service; Passenger X was not wearing a mask. She was informed again that the masks must be worn through duration of flight as it is policy. She responded 'How come nobody at the gate told me that. I have a medical condition. She was informed that when she booked the travel; a notice comes out saying that you must go to the gate over an hour before the flight and speak to a medical doctor that will determine if you can be excused. She did not respond. Her daughter was informed that she must wear the mask. The mother says she keeps breaking it. She was informed of the policy and lack of compliance on other flights have forced planes back to the gate and we don't want that to happen here so we need the masks on for the whole flight. The FA checked and advised the mother that Y year olds must wear the mask. The X year old responded 'He's Z [years old]!' Even more so I said. The mother was shown the mask policy and told that she has been told at least three times that this is mandatory. This FA walked away to give her time to read it. It was explained to the children that many people have gotten sick and this is important to keep everyone safe. We know it's hard but it is for everyone's safety.  The mother got up to place mask on child saying good luck with that. She continued to get up several times to attend to the children. The CA was informed.

The conflict arose when the mother and her children were found not wearing face masks, despite the flight's policy requiring all passengers to do so throughout the journey. The mother initially claimed she was unaware of the mask policy and cited a medical condition as a reason for non-compliance. The flight attendant provided masks from the galley, but the mother repeatedly refused to comply, arguing that her child kept breaking the mask. The attendant explained the policy, the importance of safety, and the potential consequences of non-compliance, such as the flight being delayed. The mother also mentioned she wasn't informed at the gate, to which the attendant explained the procedure for medical exemptions. Despite these discussions, the mother continued to refuse, leading the flight attendant to inform the captain, who made a public announcement about the mask policy. The mother's resistance persisted, with her son eventually stating he found the mask enjoyable, while she loudly disagreed. The mother's refusal to comply with the mask policy led to the incident being reported. The flight completed its journey, but the mother's actions highlighted a compliance issue that the crew had to address during the flight.",communication issues

Lead FA (Purser) stated that none of the FAs were comfortable coming up to the Cockpit unless the remaining pilot (in the cockpit) wore a face covering. As he really needed to use the Lav; the FO consented to the FA's request and then told me (the Captain) of the FA's request. This is the first time in my XX+ years at airline and XY+ years as a Captain; that I've had a FA hold me hostage to get a Lav break. The FA requested that the pilot remaining in the cockpit wear a face covering in the cockpit while the other pilot was absent from the cockpit on the Lav break. I never wear a face covering in the cockpit; while flying the aircraft; especially with the other pilot absent from the cockpit.If it's not already obvious; let me restate that the FARs prohibit the use of a face covering (or the wearing of a beard) that would prevent a proper seal of the O2 mask. At FL400 and a TUC (Time of Useful Consciousness) of 15 seconds; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to find out that your O2 mask doesn't work with a face covering. As the FO left the cockpit; and me wearing a face covering; per the FA's request; ATC gave us a vector off course and a speed reduction for traffic. I replied to ATC; but they couldn't hear my boom mike through the face covering. At FL400; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to find out ATC can't hear your boom mike through the face covering. Before she left; I told the Lead FA that I would be writing a report and she said something through her face covering that I couldn't hear. At FL400; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to be unable to communicate with the only other person in the cockpit.Face coverings are UN-SAFE while taxing; flying; or maneuvering the airplane. They fog up my glasses which I am required to wear; they prevent me from communicating clearly with ATC; the other pilot or with the FA when the other pilot is absent from the cockpit.After the flight; we had a long debrief with the FAs. Company COVID-19 face covering information DOES NOT address the wearing of a face covering while operating an aircraft. The FAs on this flight; believed I was operating the aircraft in disregard of the Federal Aviation Regulations and in direct violation of Company Policy. It was unclear to these FAs; who gets to tell who must wear a face covering while operating an aircraft. None of these FAs seemed to understand who the Pilot-In-Command (PIC) is when operating an aircraft.In the masked de-brief; they were argumentative and confrontational. They thought that the remaining pilot on the cockpit was required to wear an O2 mask anytime the other pilot is absent the cockpit. It is very difficult to discuss face coverings with a FA who's been told that everyone is required to wear a face covering at all times while on an aircraft or on company property. The FAs do not understand the problems caused by face coverings in the cockpit (the O2 mask; Pilot to Pilot or Pilot to ATC communications issues; or Eye Glass fogging). The FAs believe that they can tell the Captain how to operate an aircraft in direct violation of the FARs; safety procedures and common sense. This has to stop. The Company must tell all employees; but especially FAs; that the Captain is in command; that face coverings cause safety issues in the cockpit and that pilots are NOT required (in fact; are discouraged from wearing) face coverings while operating an aircraft.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported that the flight attendants were not comfortable coming into the flight deck while the pilot was on a restroom break; until the remaining pilot was wearing a face mask. Reporter described safety concerns with having to wear a face mask in the cockpit.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and flight attendants regarding the safety protocols for wearing face coverings in the cockpit. Here's a concise summary: During the flight, the First Officer requested a Lavatory break. The Lead Flight Attendant insisted that no flight attendant would enter the cockpit unless the remaining pilot wore a face covering. The Captain complied but was angered, feeling it was unprecedented and unsafe. The Captain highlighted safety issues with face coverings in the cockpit, citing potential problems with oxygen masks, communication with ATC, and fogging of glasses. These concerns were particularly acute at FL400, where quick response times are critical. The use of a face covering muffled communication, leading to difficulties in contacting ATC and the Lead FA, further complicating the situation. Post-landing, the debrief with FAs became confrontational. FAs believed the Captain was violating safety protocols by not wearing a face covering and didn't understand the Captain's authority as PIC. The Captain emphasized the need for clear company policies on face coverings in the cockpit, noting that current COVID-19 guidelines don't address this specific scenario. They stressed the importance of recognizing the PIC's authority and the hazards face coverings pose in the cockpit environment. In conclusion, the incident underscored the need for improved communication, policy clarity, and understanding of safety protocols among all crew members.",communication issues

FA A did not allow passengers to pass through the forward galley during boarding to expedite the boarding process. FA B tried his best to direct traffic at the 1L door. Due to FA A blocking traffic from coming through the forward galley passengers were only able to get to their seat using the aircraft left aisle until they reached the mid galley. This caused a delay for departure. We still had bags out and overhead bins open when the FA A made the PA that the boarding door had been closed; and to arm our doors. I ran forward and told her we were still getting bags put away; and still had open overhead bins. She stated the agent had closed the door. I stated that she should have told them we were not ready to close the boarding door. After that; all FAs armed doors and tried to get all bags and overhead bins taken care of as quickly as possible. We then felt ground movement. I looked out of the window. We had started moving backwards. We had not received an All Call; and we were still trying to get all bags stowed and overhead bins closed. I (FA C) grabbed the phone at my jumpseat and made an All Call. The FA A hung up the phone almost as soon as she answered. She simply stated her name. I stated my name and that I initiated an All Call since she had not and we were pushing back. Note that this also means she had closed the flight deck door. If the flight deck door was closed then the flight deck must have thought we were seated and stowed; when in fact we were not. After she answered her phone and stated her name; and I stated I had started the All Call; she hung up. The rest of us proceeded with stating our doors had been armed and cross checked. My phone then rang. I answered the phone stating my name. FA A stated she was now performing the All Call. I stated we had just done the All Call. She then hung up her phone. FA A also would not make the COVID-19/mask announcement. FA D made the required PA. FA A had stated to FA E that she knew one of us (FA D or myself) would make it; since she was not going to make it. We did not know she was not going to make the PA and waited until he made the decision to just make the PA since we were not hearing it being made by her.The FA A needs to be spoken to about the FARs that were violated; as well as procedures that MUST be followed. This created a very chaotic and potentially hazardous environment for all on board. Passengers and crew.,,,,Flight Attendant reported communication and procedural issues experienced with another Flight Attendant.,"The incident involved a conflict between two flight attendants (FA A and FA B) during the boarding and pre-flight preparation process. The conflict arose due to discrepancies in their communication and adherence to established procedures. FA A restricted passengers from using the forward galley during boarding, causing congestion and delays. FA B attempted to manage the boarding process at the 1L door but was hindered by FA A's actions, leading to a slower boarding procedure. After boarding was underway, FA A prematurely closed the boarding door and armed the doors without ensuring all bags and overhead bins were secured. When FA C, another flight attendant, attempted to address this by making an All Call, FA A hung up the phone and failed to complete the required COVID-19/mask announcement. FA A admitted to knowing that another flight attendant would have to make the announcement, as she was not going to do so. This resulted in confusion and a potentially hazardous situation, as the flight deck door was closed, creating the impression that the cabin was ready for takeoff when it was not. The incident concluded with FA A's alleged procedural violations and communication issues being brought to light, necessitating corrective action, such as addressing the FARs and procedures she may have violated. The situation created a chaotic and unsafe environment for both passengers and crew.",communication issues

Announcement was reiterated to remain seated. He sat back down but did not put seatbelt back on until he was approached to do so. During service; he was again; not wearing mask. I told him to put it on and he complied. During walk through; his seatbelt was once again off while the seatbelt sign was on. He had to be asked again to put it on. He wasn't happy about it but complied. After the cabin had been secured for landing and the cabin had been secured for anticipated turbulence; he took his mask back off.  At that point; it was turbulent and unsafe for us to get up. The other FA had to motion for him to put the mask back on. He complied but the mask continued to come off and we continued to motion to put it back on. After gear came down; the passenger got up (in moderate turbulence and on final approach) and moved seats. We made an announcement for him to be seated immediately. He did not stay in his original seat; but ultimately moved to a different seat anyways.Upon landing; the other FA told him moving when he did was absolutely unsafe and completely unacceptable. He just got off the airplane.  The passenger got up in turbulence on final approach after gear came down and moved seats despite being told not to. It was unsafe to make him move back to seat for weight and balance.This passenger had a complete disregard for safety and was incredibly non compliant. While all little non compliant moments at first; it continued until he did something that was truly dangerous to the people sitting near him. Not only was he non compliant with our mask policy but his reckless behavior in moving around during turbulence after being told not to could have easily injured those around him.

He then went on to state that the reason he was not able to complete his tasks prior to pushback and departure was because he was having to deal with passengers and their improper usage of masks. The B; C; and D Flight Attendants did not mention any passenger issues to us.As the First Officer; take a more proactive role in ensuring the flight attendants acknowledge the single ring prior to takeoff.  Also; it is my understanding that the flight attendants are supposed to immediately inform the pilots of any disruption or disturbance in the cabin in which they are unable to perform or complete their required tasks.,,After giving the chime and monitoring the bell across the PA I called for the Before Takeoff Checklist.  After completing the checklist we switched the radio to Tower and they cleared us for takeoff with an aircraft on a 3 NM final.  With this distraction; I failed to listen to the A FA make his Departure PA.  Around 10;000 feet the A FA called to say he had been in the aisle during takeoff.  He told the FO he had been talking to a couple of passengers about wearing their masks and hadn't received the attendant chime.  He told the FO he had not fully secured the galley and had coffee spilled on his EFB and personal device.  He said he had no physical injury or harm and that overall he was fine.  I clearly heard the chime; but failed to monitor his PA.A FA should not be monitoring masks before takeoff at that time because non compliant passengers are less of a safety risk than delaying preparation for takeoff.

On my way forward; I secured the forward portion of the aircraft; where I had 2 passengers in seats Y1 and Y3 with all 3 tray tables down and all their carry-on items in the middle seat. I asked them to stow their items and continued forward. In the time that I made it forward; 3 more passengers boarded. First a gentleman; then 2 others that were traveling together. Without stepping in front of the first gentleman I acknowledged to him that there were still empty rows left in the back of the aircraft. I said the same thing to the two guys (traveling together). I saw the 2 guys make it to the back; but did notice the first gentleman sit down.

During the safety demonstration, the flight attendant was distracted by addressing unresolved issues in row X, including carry-on items and passengers not wearing facial coverings. She did not notice the gentleman during this time. After the aircraft reached 10,000 feet and the cabin crew began serving snacks, the flight attendant noticed that the gentleman had not been sitting in seat XX2, where he was initially briefed.

Specifically, Passenger X failed to fasten his seatbelt three times before the aircraft door was closed, did not place his carry-on item under the seat as instructed, and improperly wore his face covering, leaving it below his nose and mouth. The flight attendant repeatedly requested compliance, adjusting the face mask and carry-on placement. Despite these efforts, Passenger X continued to disregard the instructions after the door was closed.

They removed those during flight and put on white mask with a filter valve that had hose connected to it and the other end connected a powered air filter that hung around their necks. When I talked with both of them I advised them they could not use the air filter or a mask with a valve. He began to argue that he called reservations and was told it was fine. He then demanded for me to show him where it said that. I pulled up the face mask information with no valves he took picture of page.

When he was ready to deplane he changed mask he was wearing back to the neck/face mask he had originally worn as he boarded.,,,,Flight Attendant reported passengers wearing non-approved face masks.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and a passenger regarding the use of face masks on board an aircraft. The passenger, who had initially boarded the flight wearing a neck/face mask, removed it during the flight and switched to a white mask with a filter valve. This mask was connected to a powered air filter that the passenger wore around their neck. The flight attendant advised the passenger that they could not use the mask with a valve or the air filter, as these were not approved for use on the aircraft. The passenger disputed this, claiming they had been told by reservations that it was acceptable. The attendant attempted to resolve the issue by showing the passenger the airline's policy on face masks, which explicitly prohibited the use of masks with valves. The passenger took a photo of the policy but continued to use the unapproved mask. During the interaction, the passenger's companion complied by switching back to their original neck/face mask, but the passenger did not. As the flight neared its end, the passenger removed the unapproved mask and switched back to their original neck/face mask before deplaning. The flight attendant documented the incident as a report of passengers wearing non-approved face masks. No formal resolution was reached, and the passenger ultimately refused to comply with the attendant's instructions, resulting in a delay in the departure process.",communication issues

I was C; and could not see the seat from where I was standing in the exit row; and did not notice the passengers placing it during boarding.  I was busy greeting passengers as they walked through; and telling people who sat in the exit row that they were seated in the exit row; and verifying they were willing to sit there.  One woman was not responding to me; and I realized she could not hear me.  She said her ears were blocked from the last landing; and they had not cleared. Since she was unable to hear or respond to my questions; I told her I would have to re-seat her.  A gentleman in the exit row loudly said she was sick; and should not be allowed on the plane.  I asked her if she was sick; and she said no.  She appeared to be congested; which is likely the reason her ears blocked on landing.  I had her trade seats with another passenger; briefed the exit row and secured the forward cabin from the exit row forward.  When I got to the front; I informed A the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure.  I did not hear a PA that the aft cabin was secure. I informed the A that the woman I moved from the exit row could not hear; that she was congested but said she was not sick.  The A said she did not appear sick or have any COVID symptoms when she boarded. I said congestion could be a COVID symptom; and A seemed surprised; and said she never heard that.

He asked to be notified; and a few seconds later I let him know the exchange was complete.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger that sat in the exit row had hearing problems and was displaying symptoms of possibly being sick.,"During a pre-takeoff safety check, the flight attendant (Party1) noticed a child seat positioned directly behind the exit row. While conducting her duties, she was occupied with greeting passengers and ensuring that those seated in the exit row were willing to assume the responsibilities of that seat. A passenger in the exit row exhibited hearing difficulties, as she was unable to respond to the flight attendant's instructions. The passenger explained that her ears were blocked due to a prior landing, leading to congestion but not indicating that she was sick. The flight attendant attempted to reseat the passenger in accordance with safety protocols, but a gentleman seated nearby objected, claiming the passenger was sick and should not be on the plane. The passenger denied being sick, though her congestion raised concerns about potential COVID-19 symptoms. The flight attendant consulted with the captain and operations, who advised her that if the passenger was not explicitly sick or exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, she could remain on the plane. The flight attendant proceeded with reseating the passenger and securing the forward cabin. The incident was resolved after the flight attendant successfully completed the seat change and informed the captain that the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure. The flight attendant did not hear a public address (PA) confirming the aft cabin was secure but ultimately ensured the situation was managed.",communication issues

The passenger responded by explaining that he had recently undergone surgery on his nose for cancer and that wearing a mask caused him pain. Despite the attendant's apologies and attempts to explain the policy, the passenger became increasingly argumentative. Recognizing that the situation was escalating and could potentially lead to further conflict, the attendant decided to discontinue the conversation.

I told her I would check and see if there was another seat she could move to.  At this time I did not see any open row that has no other people in it. I was going to send a flight family message to alert the Gate Agent. I walked up a row or two and another lady questioned me about why her seat would not recline (she was in front of the exit row). I explained to her why her seat would not recline and told her I would check with the agent about reseating them.  I then walked to the aft jump seat to send the flight family request. The agent then came down and we had a short conversation about rebooking the one lady and the other passengers who wanted a seat that reclined. There were no other seats to move the recline passenger to and the other passenger was given the option to take a later flight with no guarantee that she would have a seat by herself.

First, a passenger sought a different seat due to discomfort sitting next to someone unknown. The flight attendant attempted to find an alternative but found none available. Second, another passenger's seat would not recline, as it was located in front of an exit row. The flight attendant explained this and suggested a later flight option, as no other seats were available. While managing these requests, the flight attendant neglected to brief the exit row passengers, a crucial safety procedure. Mid-flight, she realized this oversight and promptly briefed the exit row passengers, who agreed to their seats. The cause of the incident was attributed to work overload from handling multiple requests simultaneously.

I also stocked the cockpit with a 6 pack of water and continued to do my security checks. C Flight Attendant arrived a little later and we chatted catching up since we last worked together. Shortly thereafter; B Flight Attendant arrived. B Flight Attendant and I started chatting and catching up since we had not worked together since 2019. Toward the end of B Flight Attendant and my conversation with C Flight Attendant present; I stated; 'These are crazy times since COVID. C Flight Attendant and I have recently worked together. So that we can better protect each other and social distance as much as possible; B Flight Attendant and I can do the water service. You (B Flight Attendant) can serve from the back and I can serve from the front and that we can meet somewhere in the middle of the cabin. C Flight Attendant can pass out the snacks. We all can take turns making trash runs individually. You and I can also pass out the paperwork the same way. You can distribute paperwork starting from the back of the cabin and I will start from the front of the cabin and we will meet somewhere in the middle of the cabin.' We all agreed.C Flight Attendant and B Flight Attendant continued to chat and I continued setting up and arranging my workspace in the forward galley.  As I was kneeling checking my compartment in the forward bulkhead; the First Officer walked onto the aircraft.  As he was making his greeting of 'Hello; I'm FO [name];' I responded 'Hello; I'm (A Flight Attendant)' as I raised up to greet him. As I stood up; [the] FO and I were face to face and I was startled that he was not wearing a mask. I immediately asked while stepping back creating social distance; 'Where's your mask?' FO responded; 'Where's my mask?' I repeated; 'Yes; where is your mask. We all need to wear our mask to help prevent the spread of the Coronavirus and to keep each other and their families safe.' [The] FO reached into his pocket and pulled his face mask out of it. He then rolled his bags into the cockpit with his mask in his hand. I then pushed up the cockpit door as I completed my rev napkin and completed the security document.Shortly after [the] FO got settled in the cockpit; he came out back into the cabin; but wearing his mask this time. He then said; 'Do you feel safer now that I am wearing the mask?' I responded; 'Absolutely. Thank You.' He then walked further into the cabin where C Flight Attendant and B Flight Attendant were standing between the bulkhead and row X talking. [The] FO was standing with his back against the bulkhead on the Captain side of the cabin/leaning into the aisle and B Flight Attendant was in the center of the aisle between row 1 and 2; C Flight Attendant was standing in front of row X in front of the bulkhead leaning toward the aisle. The Operations agent came and informed me of the specials and that boarding would be starting [soon]. I then went to retrieve gloves from the bulkhead compartment when I noticed that B Flight Attendant was no longer wearing her mask. She had her mask in her right hand. FO did not have his mask on properly. FO's mask was dangling by one strap on his right ear hanging down the right side of his face. Both of their noses and mouths were completely exposed as they were engaging in conversations. I then stated; 'Guys; we are about to start boarding and we are crew and it is very important that we all wear our masks over our nose and mouths while we are on the aircraft for our safety as well as the passengers who will be here shortly.' B Flight Attendant just stared at me. No one attempted to put their masks on immediately. I then repeated; 'Can I have both of you put your masks on to help the efforts of reducing the spread of COVID?' B Flight Attendant rolled her eyes at me and put her mask on covering her nose and mouth and started to walk down the aisle. FO then put on his maskand started walking back the main entrance area where I was standing.I then initiated the high-low chime to initiate that boarding would be starting shortly. FO says; as he is looking in the mirror adjusting his mask; 'Does this thing make you feel safer?' I said; 'Definitely. The masks when worn properly and with social distancing and good hand hygiene slows the spread of COVID.' FO says sarcastically; 'What is COVID?' I responded;' Everyone in the U.S. knows what COVID is since we have been dealing with it since March/April.' FO says; 'Well; I have never heard of it.' I said; 'It is a worldwide Pandemic therefore; you and everyone else has heard of it and knows exactly what it is for certain. The CDC; NIH; WHO; and the company have set guidelines stating that we all must wear mask on the planes. This should be second nature for all of us since most states have a mask mandate for public places since March/April.' We started boarding. The Captain came on the aircraft. He introduced himself and asked how things were going. I said; 'Hi! I'm (A Flight Attendant). Everything is okay except; the FO came on the aircraft without a mask and he was condescending; sarcastic; responding to me. He said; 'I wasn't here for that. I'm sorry that happened.  With the exception to the mask situation is everything okay. I said; 'Yes.' He gave me the pre-flight briefing to pass to the other Flight Attendants. He went into the cockpit. Boarding continued.In between the lag in the boarding process; B Flight Attendant comes up front from her boarding position in the back. She then opens the cockpit door (that I have pushed up as a protection since the pilots are not masked on the flight deck) and enters the cockpit and closed the door behind her. I continued to stay in my boarding position and continued the boarding process.  After about 5-7 minutes B Flight Attendant came out of the cockpit and went back to her boarding position. We continued the boarding process. I had completed the Opening PA and secured the cabin. (C Flight Attendant) came up front to tell me that the overwing was briefed. Captain then comes out of the cockpit and asked C-FA and I if everything was okay. C-FA and I responded; 'Yes.'Captain then went the back galley and talked to (B Flight Attendant) for a few minutes. During this time; I started to feel that the conversations that (B Flight Attendant) had when she entered the cockpit and their current conversation; I am the subject of discussion. So; when the Captain came back to the front of the plane I motioned for him to join me in the jetbridge to give him my version of events of (B Flight Attendant) and FO being annoyed with me for asking them to wear their masks on the plane. Since the passengers were on the plane; Captain and I stepped into the jetbridge. I told the Captain that I had asked (B Flight Attendant) and FO to put on their mask in effort to prevent or slow the spread of COVID. I told him that B Flight Attendant rolled her eyes at me and FO responded very sarcastically and condescendingly antagonizing me with a lengthy conversation regarding the mask. I did not ask anything of them outside of established protocols and guidelines established by the company; the State; and the CDC. The masks are a necessary piece of PPE that is necessary to prevent or slow the spread of COVID.'The Captain then said; 'I just need to know if you are going to be comfortable working with your crew on the plane.' I was startled and confused. I said. 'I'm sorry; I am not understanding your line of questioning.' He said; 'I don't know if you are comfortable working in a small space that is not going to give you 6 feet of space between you and your crew.' I said; 'I am talking to you about the mask policy and you are talking about social distancing. Then it dawned on me that B Flight Attendant must have said something to him about our social distancing conversation. He then repeated; 'I don't know if you are comfortable working in a small space that is not going to give you 6 feet of space between you and your crew.' I then said; 'WHOA; don't put words in my mouth. I never said anything about 6 feet of distancing to you or anyone else. There is ABSOLUTELY no way you can do our jobs with 6 feet of separation that is absurd and totally unrealistic. The passengers with the middle empty seat doesn't even have 6 feet between them. The C Flight Attendant sitting on row X is not 6 feet from the X jumpseat. When you briefed me earlier you were far less than 6 feet from me and I had no issues with distance. At this very moment that we are talking you are far less than 6 feet from me and I am fine; therefore; I think you know the answer to your question. If you need me to verbally say it; then I am fine being less than 6 feet from my crew and passengers.' He then said; 'With everything that you have on it is hard to believe that.' I said; 'I am wearing my mask and gloves which the company has approved as acceptable PPE for COVID when working; therefore I do not understand why it's concerning to you as an indication that I am uncomfortable being less than 6 feet from the passengers and my crew. We all should be using reasonable social distancing; PPE; and best hygiene practices collectively to prevent or slow the spread of COVID. I am just asking that protocol is being followed regarding my crew and passengers wearing face masks.'He then asked; 'Well is it protocol to close the cockpit door during boarding? I said; 'I never closed the door. The door was ajar with the latch/lock extended to prevent closing because you all (Captain and FO) did not have on mask on the flight deck and I had to remain in my boarding position that would put me in grave risk of potential COVID exposure or contracting COVID. My masks and PPE that I am wearing protects you and your family. If you and FO are in the cockpit without mask; there is nothing to protect me and my family since I must stand there for 30 minutes or longer. I used the ajar door as a protective shield for me from a potential COVID infection.' He said; 'You did not ask me.' I said; 'Sir; we obviously are having miscommunication; because you did not tell me that it bothered you.' He said; 'We do not have to wear masks when we are in the cockpit and when you close the door I can't hear the FO do the checks.' I said; 'That's a first. Most of the pilots close to door to hear better in the cockpit; but if you don't want the door ajar; then I won't do that. Will you at least wear the mask when the cockpit door is open to help protect me and my family from potentially contracting COVID since a lot of us may be asymptomatic spreaders?' He said; 'So you are asking us to wear a mask in the flight deck even though that is not our protocol?' I said; 'Sir; I am wearing my PPE and the passengers are wearing their PPE to protect others including you; therefore; I am asking you to wear PPE anytime you are on the plane where COVID could be potentially spread to me and others.' He said; 'Let me get this right. You want us to wear mask in the cockpit even though that is not our protocol.' I said; 'Sir; I am asking you to reciprocate the protections that I am affording you and your family by wearing my PPE properly. I am just asking for you to wear the mask to protect me and my family. How is it that we require passengers to do what we as crew are not willing to do? I have to stand in my boarding position which would be gross negligence since I would be in the path of a potential COVID exposure with no protections if you and the FO do not wear the mask with the door open. No problem. I am not willing to expose myself and my family to that level of risk. That level of consequence should not be required or expected of me while doing my job. I will have to just stand on the outside of the aircraft in front of the entrance and greet the passengers who will be wearing masks during boarding and deplaning.'He then asked; 'If,,,,Flight Attendant reported having a disagreement with the Captain and First Officer regarding their compliance with wearing face masks.,"The incident occurred when Flight Attendant A encountered non-compliance with mask policies and sarcastic remarks from the First Officer (FO) regarding COVID protocols. A addressed the FO's lack of a mask and emphasized the importance of masks as PPE. During boarding, A noticed both the FO and another flight attendant, B, were not wearing their masks properly and requested they comply. The FO made sarcastic comments about COVID, leading to a confrontation. A later discussed her concerns with the Captain, who expressed worries about her comfort working with the crew. A explained that social distancing was impractical and stressed the need for masks to protect everyone. The Captain questioned the necessity of masks in the cockpit, prompting A to suggest that the crew should wear masks when the door was open for mutual protection. The situation highlighted the need for consistent compliance with safety protocols and respectful communication among crew members.",communication issues

X1 stood and opened an overhead bin, prompting the flight attendant to instruct him to sit.

This communication breakdown led to a delay in providing an aisle chair for a connecting passenger, causing three passengers to remain on the aircraft longer than expected. The flight attendant expressed regret for the delay and suggested that ensuring access to jet bridge phone numbers could prevent future issues. To address the communication challenges, it was recommended that every flight be equipped with jet bridge phone numbers to facilitate timely communication with ground agents, thereby improving customer service and ensuring timely passenger deplaning.",communication issues

The passenger responded by asking for water, which the flight attendant initially misunderstood as a request to move. After clarifying, the passenger agreed to remain in the seat.

I was in the back; waiting for the aisle to clear so I could close the overhead bins and brief exit rows. I noticed the customer was in the galley speaking with the forward FA. I wasn't sure what her seat was; so I waited for her to go to her seat before I started walking forward and closing the bins. She grabbed her bag from row X and then sat in XYA; the exit row. I just assumed that was her assigned seat at the time. I closed the bins all the way to the front. I noticed a pilot commuting in row Z who had his mask around his chin and wasn't eating. I requested he put his mask back up and he did. The man behind him in X4 had his mask completely off; so I asked him to put it on and he did. When I asked that guy to put his on; another customer across also pulled theirs up; so I didn't have to ask that third person. I don't recall where the third person was sitting; I only remember they sat in [the area] on the left side of the aircraft. They put their mask up before I asked; so I didn't think much of that.I was quite annoyed that I had to remind so many customers to put their masks up. I briefed the exits like normal. After the door was closed and I did my compliance checks; other flight attendant motioned me toward her before the safety demo. She said that the woman who moved to the exit row was originally seated in [in a different area]; and that many customers had their masks off in that area; so she requested to move else where; and that's why she moved. I told other Flight Attendant that I did notice a lot more than usual with their masks off or down; especially in those first few rows of [that area]. Especially the [commuting] pilot and the guy behind him. Other flight attendant said the woman said something about a crew member not wearing a mask. There were a few flight attendants commuting; too; but they all had their masks on that I knew of. Later; inflight I spoke to the woman who moved; and I apologized and told her that it was not okay that they weren't wearing their masks; and that I did tell them to put them on and they did. She said she was especially appalled that a pilot wasn't wearing one; and said she was traveling to see a family member and was stressed enough. I gave her [a voucher] and offered her wine or beer; which she would have gotten in her [original] seat anyway. She seemed calmer and thanked me a lot.Later; I spoke with the [commuting] pilot and reminded him the importance of wearing masks around customers; and that one did move herself back because he wasn't wearing his. After I told him the first time (before door was closed) to put it back on; he kept it on except when eating or drinking. The man behind him; however; I told twice more (three times total including before door was closed) to put his mask on. Once inflight when I was collecting trash and he was sleeping. He had his mask all the way below his chin; near the collar of his shirt so that it didn't even look like he had one there. And another before landing; when I was doing my final compliance check. There was another guy in main cabin who fell asleep twice and I had to shake him awake and remind him to put his mask up; but his was covering his mouth; it just wasn't over his nose. I checked on the customer in XYA again and told her I spoke with that pilot again; and he has complied with mask requirement since the door was closed. Hopefully he just forgot and takes the mask requirement seriously. I only told him once; so I'm not sure how long he had it off or if he was eating before and just forgot to put it back on. I spoke with flight deck before I spoke with that commuter because our paper work and guest service tool app did not say there was a non-rev seated in Z4. So I asked FD if maybe he was listed as jumpseater; which didn't make sense because there were enough seats for all the non-revs to get on and he had higher priority. So I told FD about the customer complaint about that commuting pilot. When I spoke with him; he said he asked gate agent for a seat without the bulkhead; since he was originally given seat A3. So it seemed the woman who was seated in Z3; was swapped to A3. And the pilot was moved to Z4. I'm not sure exactly.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that many passengers; including a commuting pilot; were not compliant with the face mask policy.,"The incident involved a flight attendant addressing multiple instances of non-compliance with the face mask policy during a flight. The primary cause was several passengers, including a commuting pilot, not adhering to the mask requirements. During the boarding and pre-flight processes, the flight attendant noticed that some individuals, particularly in the exit rows and front sections of the aircraft, had their masks down or off. These included a pilot who initially had his mask around his chin and a passenger seated behind him who had his mask completely off. The flight attendant reminded these individuals to properly wear their masks, and most complied after being asked. A passenger originally seated in a different area moved herself to an exit row, citing concerns about the lack of mask compliance in her original seat area. She later explained that she was stressed and had relocated due to the pilot's mask policy violation. The flight attendant apologized for the situation, provided a voucher, and offered refreshments to the passenger, who appeared calmer afterward. The flight attendant also addressed the commuting pilot again during the flight, reminding him of the importance of mask compliance. The pilot complied after the reminder, and the flight attendant confirmed with the flight deck that the pilot had adhered to the policy post-reminder. The incident was resolved through the flight attendant's reminders and communication with the affected individuals, and no further issues were reported during the flight.",communication issues

I told them once we're finished boarding we can see if there's empty seats or you can talk to the gate agent if not. One of them sits across in XX4 for time being. Customer Service Agent (CSA) comes on and says someone else is assigned that seat. He goes back to see who should be in that seat; comes back and finds him sitting in row XY next to someone; I guess they knew each other. So the other customer stays in XX4.The customer in Y2 was also seated next to a stranger; and asked about moving up to row 1. I said unfortunately because we have seating caps; first class is at its max up there. I said once CSA comes back you can talk to him. I go to get a trash bag to collect the purell wipes; and he's right behind me when I turn around. I was confused why he was there all of a sudden. He said he would go talk to the gate agent. I told him to make sure he has all his bags if he's stepping off; but didn't understand why he didn't just wait for GA to come back. Because he had to come back to sort out the customers in row XX. And he asked why he had to take his things; thinking that meant he'd miss the flight. I asked why not just wait in your seat until the gate agent comes back; and he calmed down and nodded; saying that's a better idea. I guess he didn't hear me when I initially told him to wait for CSA to come back. Then CSA comes on and finishes sorting [out] XX12. Then he talks to Y2 and says exactly what I told him about seat caps; maybe he told him something more I'm not sure. Y2 kept complaining about the whole row 1 being open; and why can't he sit there; as if nobody explained the covid seating caps to him (both me and CSA did).Then; I finish collecting wipes and notice XX2 has a lace mask. Like lacey dress or underwear material; super thin with holes in it. And I ask if she has a regular mask without holes; or we can give one to her. And she has a startled/insulted look on her face; and says how she needs the holes because 'I can only breathe out of my left nostril.' I told her if it's a medical concern; it's not showing up on our end; and we weren't informed of any passengers with medical exceptions. So we would need to talk to the CSA and get that on your booking; so you can get an exception. And then she says how she flew with that mask from ZZZ; and it was fine. I told her it was possible nobody noticed on those flights; and unfortunately it's not allowed. Even if nobody else noticed before; that doesn't mean I can ignore it when I notice.So I go back up and flag down the CSA as he's closing the jetbridge doors. And I ask him about any medical exceptions; and he said nobody was approved for that and that he didn't notice anyone with a lace mask. So he says he'll be back with a mask. We have masks onboard but it was better he did that because she was already giving me attitude about it. He comes back and asks who it was and I said XX2; one of the ones we were talking with earlier. He goes back and gives her the mask and comes back saying how she told him that she wore that mask from ZZZ and I that he told her that it doesn't matter what happened on previous flights. Basically the same stuff from when I spoke to her.She got past him during boarding; then the other FA up front; then me in back during the whole seat issue; and then the GA again when he helped with the seat issue. And it wasn't until near departure time that I even noticed. So I think there's a good chance that on her other flights; those CSAs and FAs didn't notice either.Also; it was obvious she didn't have a medical exemption because she told me she needs a hole-y mask since she can only breathe out of 1 nostril. What I did not tell her was that she was speaking to a FA who hasn't been able to breathe out of either nostril in years because of a medical issue; and I was wearing a regular mask just fine. Iwould feel blessed if I could breathe out of even just one nostril. Somehow she didn't think that breathing out of one's mouth alone is possible in a mask. And I know I'm not the only FA with a similar sinus issue; too; and we all wear regular masks.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that several passengers had seat location issues and another passenger was not wearing a proper face mask.,"The incident occurred during a flight, involving several passengers and the flight attendant (FA). The first issue arose when passengers in seats XX1 and XX2 requested to move due to discomfort sitting next to strangers. The FA explained that seat assignments would be sorted by the Customer Service Agent (CSA) upon boarding completion. One passenger moved to seat XX4, which was initially assigned to another passenger. The CSA eventually resolved the seating arrangement.
The second issue involved a passenger in seat Y2, who sought to move to row 1 but was informed that first class was at capacity. The passenger grew agitated and insisted on speaking to the gate agent. The FA advised the passenger to wait for the CSA, who later confirmed the seating restrictions. Despite efforts to explain, the passenger continued to complain about the seating policy. The final issue occurred when the FA noticed a passenger in seat XX2 wearing a lace mask with holes, which violated the airline's mask policy. The passenger explained that the mask was necessary due to a medical condition, but the FA noted that no medical exception had been filed. The FA referred the passenger to the CSA, who provided a proper mask. The passenger was initially resistant but ultimately complied. The incident was resolved when the CSA ensured the passenger in seat XX2 complied with the mask policy, and the other passengers were reassigned seats as needed.",communication issues

I picked up garbage and he again/still did not want to comply with our COVID mask policy and had it down.  I asked him again.  He'd pull it up then pull it down again being non-compliant.I let our Flight Attendant (FA) D know. Flight Attendants A; B; D and F were doing two trash pick-ups and told him twice to comply.

I guarantee he will cause issues on his next flight.We all agreed that if he didn't comply again we would issue a warning.  We actually gave him more warnings than we should have as he kept pulling the face mask down after we would walk away. I walked by doing visas and Passenger A again was non component with his mask under his nose.  I told our FA A to have a chat with him. He should have been issued a warning but due to bumps on descent we didn't have time and it wasn't safe. Again I know he will be non-compliant on his next leg.

Despite these requests, Passenger A was observed pulling his mask below his nose multiple times, including after being reminded by the crew.

Passenger boarded the plane without wearing a mask and took a seat in X1. The Fwd FA approached and reminded passenger about the required mask policy. Passenger reluctantly complied and as the FA turned to walk away; the passenger called her an '[expletive]'. After the FA informed us about this; I first asked the FA if passenger is being disruptive. The FA stated that passenger was not. I then asked if she would like me to go speak to the passenger. The FA stated that was not necessary. Finally; I asked if she would like me to request a customer service representative. The FA again said no; the situation is under control and she would let us know if the problem continues. I messaged my Dispatcher to keep them in the loop of what was said. We pushed; de-iced; and while taxing to our assigned runway; I asked the FO to call and make sure there were no further issues in the back. The FA stated that the passenger had fallen asleep; so we elected to continue. About mid-way through the flight; the Fwd FA called up and stated that the passenger had woken up and was starting to cause some disturbances. The FO was already the PF and I asked him to take radios as well. The passenger asked for a cup of water so passenger didn't have to wear the mask because she was 'drinking'. The FAs let this go on for about '30 minutes' (quoting them) and the passenger had not drank any of the water. Passenger again was non-compliant with the mask and both FAs asked passenger three times to wear the mask. At this point; I sent another message asking for a customer service representative to meet us at the gate in ZZZ1 and explained to the Dispatcher everything the FAs had told me. About 5 minutes after that; the Fwd FA called up again. Again; I told the FO his controls; his radios. The FA then explained that the passenger was now starting to 'scream' on the plane and yelled very loudly; '#@%^! I'm not from [foreign country]!' While doing this; proceeded to flip off both FAs. I again messaged our Dispatcher with this information and now requested Security along with the customer service representative. The FAs and I talked back forth regarding passenger danger level. The passenger was remaining in the seat and making no other threatening gestures; so we did not see the need to declare an Emergency. We continued the flight to ZZZ1 with no further incidences. After landing; I had the FO call Ops just to make sure a customer service representative and security were waiting for us at the gate. Upon arrival into the gate; a customer service representative and security officer where indeed right there. The customer service representative immediately came onto the plane and removed the passenger.The FAs did not make any indication and no one told me they suspected the passenger was drunk. Seems as if passenger was just a genuinely disturbed person.We probably should have gotten security or customer service involved at ZZZ because of the name calling. Because the passenger had put on the mask and was making no further threatening behavior; we decided to make a note of it and continue. We all agreed though; that if passenger made one more derogatory comment; we would most likely be removing passenger from the flight. We had no further problems until mid-flight.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger was not compliant with mask policy and being disruptive. Captain reported multiple interruptions during the flight in order to communicate with company about the situation.,"During a flight operated by the air carrier, a passenger exhibited non-compliance with the mask policy and disruptive behavior, leading to multiple interruptions and communication with the company. The incident began during boarding when the passenger boarded without a mask, was reminded by the flight attendant (FA), and reluctantly complied. However, the passenger cursed the FA after she turned away. The FA informed the flight crew, and the captain was informed. The captain assessed the situation, determined it was under control, and communicated with dispatch to keep them informed. The flight proceeded, but the passenger became disruptive again mid-flight, refusing to wear the mask and claiming to be ""drinking"" to avoid it. The FAs allowed this for about 30 minutes, but the passenger did not drink. When the passenger continued to be non-compliant, the FAs repeatedly asked her to wear the mask, prompting the captain to request a customer service representative and security. The passenger eventually screamed and flipped off the FAs, leading the captain to message dispatch again and request security. Despite the passenger's disruptive behavior, no emergency was declared. The flight continued to its destination, and upon landing, security and a customer service representative were present. The passenger was removed from the aircraft by the customer service representative. The FAs did not suspect the passenger was intoxicated but believed she was disturbed. The crew agreed that earlier intervention, such as involving security or a customer service representative, could have been warranted due to the initial name-calling.",communication issues

Masks have to be made of solid material.So thinking the gate agent would say something to her about the mask Passenger X boards the plane and takes her seat wearing her mesh mask. FWD Flight Attendant (FA) sees this and questions it and then calls me for a reference. I stated to her; I don't think it's an approved mask for flying; let me find it in the manual before going to Passenger X. While I'm trying to find it; FWD FA sends a message to the gate agent about Passenger X wearing this mesh mask.  FWD FA also informs the Captain as well. After searching under COVID section; I find it and inform FWD FA and the Captain that it's not approved and that I'll inform her that her mask is not compliant. I approach Passenger X about her mesh mask and also show her in manual that it's not compliant. Passenger X makes a statement that she's been allowed to wear it on her flights. I then read the mask compliance portion in the manual verbatim. She makes a little fuss about it and then states 'Fine; hand me a mask.' I tell her 'Thank you.' I head back up to the FWD part of the cabin; galley area to inform FWD FA and Captain we're good. Passenger X switched out her mask for one of our mask. Also show them both in the manual where it's located if there's ever any other issues that arise in the future. They can both reference.

During the flight, the flight attendant questioned the mask's approval, consulted the manual, and informed the captain. The flight attendant then approached the passenger, showed the manual's mask compliance section, and explained the mask was not approved.

He further alleged that I knew about this prior to takeoff. I responded that I was not aware of any such issue; and would not have departed had I known. He said he had cell phone video and observed the aft FA (Flight Attendant) make a interphone call to the cockpit. Noting this was a serious safety issue. I concurred with him that if this occurred it was indeed a safety issue and that I would investigate and report as required; but I had not received an interphone call from the FA. He reiterated the cell phone video and stated his intent to submit it to [the company] and the FAA. He provided no further details; nor showed me the video; and departed. As background; the flight was operating about 5 hours late due to aircraft non-availability. Once we had an aircraft; we boarded and waited another 25 mins or so for a replacement FO (First Officer) as the original FO was now projected illegal. The new FO was a [distantly-based] new hire; but this had little if any impact on the flight. On taxi out we stopped for about 20 minutes in the west hard stand to receive a complete weather reroute from ATC; reentered the new route; got approval from dispatch to operate on the new route; changed runways and departures; briefed and accomplished flows and checklist. We had 4 minutes to make our [Departure Time]. I immediately made the 'FA prepare for Takeoff PA'; cleared to line up and wait by ATC; cycled the seat belt chime to alert FAs we were taking the runway; sat for 15-20 seconds and were cleared for takeoff. Uneventful flight to ZZZ till passenger approached me (FO was already gone) at gate in ZZZ. All of this delay information just indicates that passengers; especially a small child; might well have needed to use the lavatory. So I did query the Flt Attendants about this incident. The aft FA did make an interphone call to the #1 FA; following his chain of command; to advise that a father had taken his son into the restroom. The #1 FA told me he did not contact us on the Flt Deck because we had 'already started rolling for takeoff' and he was concerned about violating the sterile cockpit in a critical phase of flight. He made a quick decision that overall safety was better served by not contacting us. Clearly taking off with anyone in the lavatory is unsafe and against [company] SOPs. Unclear to me in this event is exactly when the father and child entered the lavatory. If during the hold short or line up and wait (15-20 secs) phase; a call could be appropriate to the cockpit to alert us of the situation. We could decline the takeoff clearance and clear the runway as needed. If in fact we were accelerating (rolling?) for takeoff; the passengers' safety may be more compromised by the rapid deceleration of a rejected takeoff. The FA's situational awareness is limited to our departure PA; and taking the runway chime followed by aircraft movement and engine noise. This limited input could affect their decision making process as to where we are in the takeoff maneuver.Secondly; I'm concerned about communication. I brief the #1 FA on every flight; I believe this to be important since we now fly with many different crews; from many different bases; frequently different on every leg. I did so on this flight to relay details of the flight and to open up communication. Still no one called to advise us of this event during the entire flight. I only learned about it from the concerned passenger at the arrival gate. Kind of blindsided. Not even the father in the lavatory said anything. Of note there were 10 uniformed crew members on the flight who said nothing when departing; though they may not have been in a position to observe anything. Bottom line is passenger safety is paramount; I believeunless we're on high speed takeoff roll; we could have handled a reject safely if notified. Perhaps a more assertive approach by the FA would have prevented this event from progressing to a takeoff with passengers not in their seats.,,,,A321 Captain reported being informed after landing of passenger using lavatory during previous takeoff roll.,"A passenger reported to the flight captain that a father and small boy were in the lavatory during takeoff. The passenger provided a cell phone video showing an interphone call made by a flight attendant to another crew member, who then did not contact the cockpit to avoid violating sterile cockpit rules during a critical phase. The flight experienced multiple delays, including aircraft unavailability and weather reroutes, leading to a near-miss of the departure time. The flight attendant involved made an interphone call but did not inform the cockpit, leaving the captain unaware of the situation until post-landing. The captain expressed safety concerns, emphasizing the importance of timely communication during takeoffs to allow for safe aborted takeoffs if necessary. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication protocols, especially with diverse crews, to prevent similar occurrences and ensure passenger safety.",communication issues
1667046,Aircraft X,General Seating Area,,Flight Attendant In Charge,,,Safety Related Duties,Communication Breakdown,Party1 Flight Attendant; Party2 Flight Crew,1667046,,,,,,,,,,,,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Illness / Injury,,Y,Person Flight Attendant,In-flight,General Maintenance Action,Human Factors,Human Factors,It was brought to my attention by the other Flight Attendant  that an older woman; who had pre-boarded informed her that her seat would needed to be wiped down with Clorox after she deplaned. After speaking with the PAX (Passenger) she informed me that she had a highly contagious disease. After speaking with her; She explained that her illness wasn't airborne but someone could contract it if they touched anything she'd touched. I asked her for her name. Although; it was turbulent and we were on final descent; I contacted the cockpit they were informed of what was going on. I was told he couldn't talk at that time but did I need me Paramedics to meet us at the gate. I asked him to have a Supervisor meet the plane. The PAX was not in distress and showed no signs of needing immediate medical attention; therefore I didn't call for medical assistance. Once at the gate pure chaos erupted. Ops quickly opened the door allowed me to get off the plane then close and locked the jet bridge door which prohibited anyone from deplaning. I was trying to explain what was going on; meanwhile the Captain was trying to get into the jet bridge. I had to open the the door for him. Then I was told to make an announcement telling the PAX not to deplane. I checked on the UM (Unaccompanied Minor) and make sure he understood that he was okay. There were several Supervisors present. I was simultaneously speaking to them and Inflight. We had to wait for clearance to allow PAX off the plane. Together with Ops and Supervisors gathered all the facts so that they could inform the UM's parent's of the possible exposure. I was trying to keep the PAX that was in that same row with the ill PAX and the UM from deplaning as requested by the Supervisors. Pax were cleared to deplane; Supervisor took care of the UM and the PAX in that row deplaned with me getting her information. After everyone deplaned; I helped the ill PAX off the aircraft. I returned to the plane and cleaned the row with our onboard disinfectant. After that; I was talking to the Inflight SUP; trying to help a crew change; speaking with the Captain; updating my crew; and telling the outbound crew they could come down the jet way and board the aircraft. I did not get all the ill PAX information to put in my IR.Once we landed the pilots could have called us back and clarify what was going on. I feel if that would have happened; ground ops would not have went into lock down. Collectively we could have came up with a plan. Everyone plays a vital role but sometimes if we are not flying the plane we are made to feel less than for lack of a better word. I could only communicate the information I was given . We were in final descent but once we landed I did not feel comfortable contacting the cockpit. Once we landed the Captain never tried to contact us to clarify what was going on; which created a problem once we got to the gate and he was locked in. It was only at that time that he wanted know what was going on.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant in Charge reported a communications breakdown between Flight Attendant and flight crew shortly after being notified of a passenger with a 'highly contagious disease'.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between a flight attendant and the flight crew of a B737 aircraft, triggered by the presence of a passenger with a highly contagious disease. The flight attendant was informed by another crew member about the passenger, who had pre-boarded and requested that her seat be cleaned with Clorox after deplaning. Upon speaking with the passenger, the flight attendant learned that the individual had a contagious illness, which could be transmitted through contact but was not airborne. Despite the turbulence and being on final descent, the flight attendant contacted the cockpit, informing them of the situation. The cockpit, occupied by the captain, was unable to communicate at that time but was advised to have a supervisor meet the plane at the gate. The passenger was not in distress and did not require immediate medical attention, so the flight attendant did not call for emergency services. Upon landing, chaos erupted at the gate. Operations staff opened the door, allowing the flight attendant to deplane, but then locked the jet bridge, preventing other passengers from exiting. The captain attempted to enter the jet bridge, and the flight attendant was forced to open the door for him. The flight attendant was instructed to make an announcement asking passengers to remain on the plane, while supervisors gathered to collect information and inform the parents of an unaccompanied minor (UM) about potential exposure. The flight attendant worked to prevent the UM and other passengers in the affected row from deplaning, as requested by supervisors. Once cleared, passengers, including the UM, were allowed to exit, with the flight attendant collecting the ill passenger's information. After everyone had deplaned, the flight attendant assisted the ill passenger off the aircraft, cleaned the affected row with onboard disinfectant, and continued her duties, including coordinating with the inflight supervisor, the captain, and the outbound crew. The incident highlighted a breakdown in communication post-landing, as the captain did not contact the cabin crew to clarify the situation, leading to confusion and the subsequent lockdown. The flight attendant expressed frustration with the lack of communication and the resulting delays, suggesting that a coordinated approach could have been achieved if the captain had communicated with the cabin crew after landing. The proposed solution was for the captain to contact the cabin crew post-landing to avoid the lockdown and develop a unified plan. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of clear communication and collaboration among all crew members, regardless of their role.",communication issues

One; if the crew never left the gate when they encountered a power distribution irregularity when switching from ground to APU power. Two; if Line Control had a Jetway Operator standing by at the gate. And three; if there was a better and clearer communication between the maintenance crew.I received a gate call on the radio; that Aircraft X was coming back to the gate; due to a 'Warn Elec' message on EICAS. I was informed by Line Control that Aircraft X was returning to the gate and was asked if I needed the jetway to be pulled up. I replied 'Yes I will need the jetway pulled up'. Myself and two mechanics that were assigned to Aircraft X; headed out to the gate. As we approached the gate; the ground crew were getting ready to greet the aircraft; no Jetway Operator. At this time I made a second request to Line Control; for a Jetway Operator. The aircraft arrives; the ground crew guide the plane in. One Mechanic jumps on the headset; the other climbs in to the E compartment to reset circuit breakers.I was thumbing through the iPad; looking for possible causes in the AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) and FIM (Fault Isolation Manual) procedures. Maintenance was ready to go. Still no Jetway. At this time I decided not to wait any longer and go through the hatch of the plane and get onboard. I pointed upstairs to the Mechanic on the headset. I got his attention a second time and mouthed 'upstairs' and pointed upwards again. He nodded. As I am climbing in the E compartment; I got the other Mechanic's attention. He had told me that he reset circuit breakers and that I should see if the message cleared. I agreed.I banged on the hatch before opening it; then proceeded to crack it open. I saw light; looked clear to open. Heard a yell; then a foot come through; hitting me on the head; face; then right shoulder. I reacted by catching a foot with a black shoe and proceeded to hoist the foot to safety; by placing it in the galley on solid ground. I got out and I saw an elderly gentleman; a Flight Attendant; sobbing from pain sitting down. At this point I headed into the cockpit and I started pushing buttons to clear the message. No help. The First Officer and the Observer were explaining the problem they encountered before leaving the gate initially. The Captain was more concerned with the Flight Attendant; than getting this plane out. He took his time and explained to the passengers in great detail of the happenings that occurred. He should have just assured the passengers that matters would be solved quickly and swiftly; instead of shining the light on us maintenance. He was very rude and never once did anyone ask me if I was okay.Now; people are starting to show up. Port Authority police; some safety members from our maintenance department; one other mechanic. Through this bad ordeal; I am disappointed as to treatment that I was subjected to by the Port Authority police; the Captain and one female flight attendant; who felt that her opinion mattered more than the professionalism required to maintain in front of our customers. It never ceases to amaze me on how insignificant we as mechanics are made to feel by other departments here at [Company]. I thought we were all on the same team!,,,,Mechanic reported that a Flight Attendant was injured when he accidentally stepped through an open floor hatch.,"The incident occurred when a maintenance crew responded to a 'Warn Elec' message on an aircraft, leading them to attempt resetting circuit breakers. Due to a delay in obtaining a jetway operator, the maintenance team proceeded without one, resulting in a mechanic entering the aircraft through an open hatch. During this process, a flight attendant accidentally stepped through the hatch, causing injuries to both the flight attendant and the mechanic. The Captain's management of the situation and subsequent interaction with the maintenance crew were perceived as disrespectful, highlighting a need for improved interdepartmental communication and support systems. Proposed solutions include ensuring a jetway operator is available and enhancing communication protocols to prevent such incidents. The outcome underscores the importance of teamwork and respect in addressing technical issues efficiently.",communication issues

I walked out and a mother said her toddler had to use the restroom and couldn't wait. I told the woman that I needed to contact the Captain and see if it was possible to let her use the facility before departure. I walked back to the aft inter phone and called the cockpit. The Captain said we would pull off to the side and she would have about 2-3 minutes to use the lavatory. I walked back out into the cabin and relayed the information to her and said to wait until the plane stopped and to make it as quick as possible. The aircraft turned and when we stopped the woman handed the toddler to her husband and they headed to the back lavatory. As the father and toddler entered the lavatory there was a single high-low chime. I headed back to the aft inter phone as the [Flight Attendant] A cleared us for departure. I called the Captain to remind him that we had a passenger and toddler in the lavatory and he responded 'we are going; tell them to hang on'. I knocked on the lavatory door and told the passengers to hang on; that we were taking off and to please stay in there until I said it was safe to come out (keep in mind that there were no empty seats towards the back and they were about 15 rows from their seat). It is very bumpy for the first 5-10 minutes in LAS this time of year and I didn't want them up for initial ascent either. We took off and around the 10;000 ft. ding I escorted the gentleman and toddler back to their seats. The Captain called back via the inter phone and apologized and said something to the effect of 'we were supposed to be second for departure but they moved us up'.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that Captain elected to take off with a gentleman and toddler in the lavatory.,"The incident occurred during a flight's initial stages at LAS airport, where a mother requested her toddler use the restroom before departure. The flight attendant informed the Captain, who agreed to allow the passenger to use the lavatory, giving them approximately 2-3 minutes. After the passengers entered the lavatory, the Captain decided to expedite departure, despite the flight attendant's reminder that the passengers were still inside. The aircraft took off, and around 10,000 feet, the flight attendant escorted the gentleman and toddler back to their seats. The Captain later apologized, explaining that the flight was moved up in the departure order. The flight attendant ensured the passengers' safety during the process.",communication issues

Saturdays are busier than normal but no effort to adjust that today.  Then management assigns domestic on what they thought was an open desk [XX] but that desk was open and they make that domestic dispatcher who showed at XA00 to move off the desk they assigned in error to desk [XX] one and half hours after being here; in that time of moving desk to desk [YY] they received several calls (please note that releases have that desk number on it) so the one remaining international desk [ZZ] has to now answer and transfer the calls to correct desk; while working their new workload which is in beginning of shift and they are also working to remain in control of desk. The Domestic Dispatcher is now rushing to move and reset up and transfer flights between desks; and of course there are several calls and now all desks in international which where reduced by two are forced to help the lone domestic dispatcher with these issues; in addition.  Now that this Dispatcher moved all but one flight was moved that was caught by incoming Dispatcher and moved to the original desk that had it on the domestic side since new Dispatcher was also on a call and still trying to set up their new desk.  The phones kept ringing on wrong desk and the lone Domestic Dispatcher asked for help not knowing that two of the International Dispatchers where already on phone with the Domestic Dispatchers other issues.  I asked the International Dispatcher next to me to get the Chief to lend assistance but they where in the bridge morning meeting discussing the weather and daily assignments.  The International Dispatcher came back to report that Chief was unavailable; and I suggested that the Chief needs to leave that meeting and help domestic dispatcher for they are swamped and bringing down the entire Caribbean team; so the other dispatcher went to Chief and insisted on getting help for domestic dispatch and fortunately there was a Chief in training who came down to answer phones and lend a hand.  The phone calls I took where Flight ABCD time off gate was generated in error and needed to be removed; Flight DAEE was in ZZZ going to ZZZ1 and they where given a ground delay and ATC re-route so then I had to get reroute ensure compliance build that route and verify that we had petrol to accomplish this: I got so in detailed with this issues I did not get time out and I had to ask International Dispatcher to remove that time.  While working on weather briefing and re-route another of the Domestic lines where ringing and all International Dispatchers where on phone so I grabbed the call and placed them on hold to finish re-route but that person hung up and then called.  I advised the captain of Flight DAEE that I would finish re-route after I briefed on weather and send them an ACARS with route and burns; since the Domestic Dispatcher was at this point under water and not coming up.  The Captain said that would be fine and I built his new route while I answered another one of the Domestic Dispatchers phone lines.  This was a flight attendant who once I answered she said they had a medical emergency and needed Medlink!  I asked for flight number while I was still engaged in the re-route for the Domestic Dispatch (placing all my international desk and its duties on lower priority).  The Flight Attendant (FA) was not using proper radio telephone procedure; nor had any patience; to connect to Medlink we need basic info flight number; age; gender; problem or issue but the FA when placed on hold thought they where disconnected and called back but to further aspirate the issue they called the original desk domestic side of room and needed to be transferred to international side of room.  So this one flight and one flight attendant had to be spoken to sternly just to remain on line with Medlink.  Now once Medlink got on lineagain the FA did not provide information had to be extracted by Medlink and that conversation was very difficult because the FA world speak pause and speak not allowing Medlink to speak or speaking over Medlink with the constant live mic one of the mics stuck open and there was a constant hiss in back ground and flight attendant kept telling doctor to speak louder and the doctor was practically yelling; finally the FA said that they could not hear so I ACARS crew to have PIC call in and speak to Medlink; since the doctor on board was saying they needed to land now; the Domestic Dispatcher got that call and remained on line with the Medlink and did divert the flight but this poor planning of management and multiple error caused problems for a international section that was already task saturated due to managements closing of several desk and distributing that international workload.Several failures:  First Management not understanding that it is not the number of flights but the quality of work and the management team has closed desk that was originally planned open based on published schedule.  Second; Management not familiar with work on quad and placed a Domestic Dispatcher on a weekend International desk; third; the decision to move was not well thought or executed and if it was not for another dispatcher an airborne flight would have been left unattended; Forth; placing a domestic dispatcher in an area by themselves with no support of other domestic dispatchers working similar area and familiar with weather; GDP; and ATC initiatives; fifth; only having one chief who was also task saturated; sixth; not having properly training flight attendants on proper radio telephone etiquette and protocol. Stop closing desk; and Staff properly (follow workload committee models numbers and not a number that is not truly representative of the actual work.  Have sector managers that come from ranks of dispatch and fully understand issues on floor or at least have them trained by dispatch instructors who have worked the floor.  Place like dispatchers together i.e. domestic working NE or ZZZ1 or SE together so highest quality of information is properly disseminated to flight crews without taking extra time and further task saturating the other dispatchers and areas.  Have an International Chief and Domestic Chief (or at least two Chiefs; who are current and qualified to better aid floor dispatchers).  Properly train all flight attendants for proper radio telephone etiquette and protocol.,,,,Dispatcher reported staffing issues resulting in being inundated with various tasks and moving from the desk to desk in order try to maintain operational control and communications with their flights.,"The incident arose from a combination of poor management decisions and miscommunication within the dispatch team, leading to a highly task-saturated workload and operational breakdown. The root cause included the reduction of international desks without adjusting the workload, assigning a domestic dispatcher to an international desk during peak hours, and insufficient staffing planning. These decisions overwhelmed the remaining dispatchers, who were forced to handle an influx of calls and re-routing of flights while managing their own workload. Additionally, a flight attendant's lack of proper radio telephone protocol compounded the issue during a medical emergency, requiring the intervention of a Chief in training to assist the overwhelmed domestic dispatcher. The result was a near-disruption of operations, with the flight being diverted due to the poor planning and lack of support. The dispatcher highlighted several systemic failures, including inadequate staffing models, lack of trained leadership, and insufficient training for flight attendants. Proposed solutions included restoring proper staffing levels, having dedicated international and domestic chiefs, and improving training for both dispatchers and flight attendants to prevent similar incidents.",communication issues

After boarding, the pilot announced they were departing, and the attendant noticed a discrepancy in their assigned trip on the crew portal. During taxi, the attendant's phone rang from crew scheduling, prompting them to answer despite knowing they shouldn't use their phone on the aircraft. This led to a policy violation.

It became apparent that while we thought he was sleeping with the blanket covering his head he had indeed been puffing his cigarette. (A-FA) then realized when she thought she had smelled a faint cigarette odor in FC (First Class) but found no smoke or anything in the lav she chalked it up to being on someone's clothes. These types of cigarettes are a newer items that are smokeless and quite odorless as well. He was standing outside baggage claim as we were walking to our crew van so (C-FA) and myself politely went up to him and mentioned that we had found his smokeless cigarettes around his seat. Our intention was to politely tell him that it was a fine-able offense and so for future flying he'd have been warned. However before we finished speaking he started berating us and our airline; using explicit language and saying we are the worst airline he's ever experienced and that the cigarettes had fallen out of his pocket. He said that he had already tweeted a negative review and was awaiting [TV New Channel] response and to get the '[Expletive deleted]' which (C-FA) and I remained calm and polite and walked away knowing anything else we might say would fall on deaf ears. During our agricultural form pass-out of the flight we had limited quantities so I allowed a few traveling families to include their elderly grandparents on their forms so that we had enough. (Literally we were short only 2 forms on walk through). [Passenger] said he heard that and was notifying [State] Agriculture that we allowed them to lie on their forms. However we had a few families take extra forms and then delivered those to previously stated families to fill out for the grandparents so his allegations were obviously not true. He was a very rude passenger and escalated any event on this flight to create a very hostile work environment. Earlier submitted report:We had a very disgruntled first time [Airline] flyer occupying seat XX.His first grievance was that we could not serve him a double bourbon upon boarding and then became pissed when he realized we served our pre-departure beverages in plastic glasses and refused his sparkling white wine when it was handed to him. His companion then requested a pillow which I told them we did not have and his response was 'Do you guys have [expletive deleted] anything'; I apologized and walked away. During the flight while I was guarding for a Pilot break he tried to stand and come forward; I politely explained I needed everyone to remain seated as the pilots were utilizing the lav. He began to complain once seated again that this was '[expletive deleted] unnecessary and he's never seen it before'...he then got impatient and got up to attempt going to the aft and rudely made his way past our C doing a water service cussing under his breath. While there was no personal damage done; his choice of foul language and bad attitude is worth mentioning seeing as our normally favored [Airline] service was not enjoyed by him and he may write one healthy complaint.[Passenger] should not be allowed to fly our airline and should be fined for his obvious rule breaking behavior. He was defiant and apparently has trouble understanding our responsibilities as a crew.,,Mid flight I noticed I smelled cigarettes around row X; and after looking could not locate the origin of the smell; and saw no smoke. At this point I figured someone had smoked before we left and had shifted positions and the smell was suddenly released from their clothing.

(Flight Attendant D) and (Flight Attendant B) informed him as they passed on the way to the shuttle that that kind of behavior is a fine able offense.Crew to be made aware of the situation on his original flight. Agents should inform him before he boards that this kind of behavior is illegal and flight attendants can and will in force FAA rules.,,Flight attendants reported finding smokeless cigarette butts and confronting passenger in baggage area.,"The incident involved a passenger (Party2) and a flight attendant (Party1) aboard a flight. The flight attendant discovered three smokeless cigarette butts in the first-class cabin near the passenger's seat.

Upon deplaning, the flight attendant and a colleague confronted the passenger about the butts, explaining it was a fineable offense. The passenger responded with explicit language, blaming the butts on his pocket and claiming he had already filed a negative review. During the flight, the passenger was confrontational, complaining about alcohol service and using offensive language. He disregarded crew instructions to remain seated and made inappropriate comments. His behavior disrupted the cabin environment and created a hostile atmosphere for the crew.The flight attendants also managed a situation where they allowed extra forms for families with elderly grandparents, despite a shortage. The passenger falsely accused them of misconduct, which was later proven baseless. The result was a disruptive and hostile environment for the crew, prompting concerns about the passenger's potential legal action or future banning from the airline. The flight attendant documented the passenger's behavior, highlighting his defiance and disregard for crew responsibilities.",communication issues

However, due to a hectic pre-takeoff taxi process, where passengers repeatedly needed to be reminded to sit down and fasten their seatbelts, the information was inadvertently forgotten. The lead FA proposed a potential solution: implementing a system in the computer to denote FFDOs with a triangle symbol, which could help ensure the information was readily accessible during busy boarding or pre-takeoff procedures.

The attendant expressed concerns about the item's size, its inability to fit into a battery containment bag, and the presence of lithium batteries, particularly since the flight was scheduled to operate over water for five hours. The attendant sought clarification from the Customer Service Representative (CSR) and the Captain regarding the item's approval but did not receive satisfactory answers. The Captain acknowledged the presence of other lithium battery-powered devices on board, such as cell phones and laptops, but deemed the drum set acceptable.

The crew was; at that moment not aware of any inoperative chiller on the aircraft. During the briefing with the Captain; and after checking the list of maintenance issues in my link; there was no mention about an inoperative chiller. The two carrier boxes posed a significant tripping hazard to our customers boarding; but the catering representative refused to remove the carrier boxes; stating that the flight attendants should take them on board. The carrier boxed where too heavy to lift; and it is my understanding that we should not carry heave carrier boxes full of dangerous goods through an aircraft with customers on board. An In-flight Supervisor was in the area and was unhelpful in resolving this dangerous situation. While I was trying to have these carrier boxes with dry ice removed; this Supervisor displayed aggressive behavior and stating if I was refusing the dry ice and taking a delay. He was unwilling to listen or understand the problem with having two carrier boxes full of dry ice being placed in front of the boarding door while customers were boarding. At this point I was informed by the Captain that chiller number 7 in the aft galley had an issue and the fuse was pulled. No one informed the crew about this. In the interest of departing on time; and to satisfy the Supervisor who was getting more hostile by the minute; I decided to accept two bins of dry ice; that I hand carried on the aircraft myself.

The flight attendant was not initially informed about an inoperative chiller, which the catering representative cited as the reason for leaving the boxes on the ground. The boxes posed a tripping hazard to passengers boarding the aircraft, but the catering representative refused to remove them, insisting the flight attendant take them on board. The boxes were too heavy for the crew to lift safely, and an In-Flight Supervisor present in the area was unhelpful and displayed aggressive behavior when the flight attendant attempted to resolve the issue. During the conflict, the Captain informed the crew that chiller number 7 in the aft galley had an issue, but the crew had not been previously notified.

I had my MFD on the status page before push and all doors showed green. We did before start flows and before start checklist. We were cleared to push and also to cleared to start engines shortly thereafter. I reached over and started engine one. The number one engine was fully online and had stabilized when we received a master caution. The EICAS message was saying that the front door on the FO (First Officer) side was ajar. By this time we had completed the push and the ground crew was working on getting the airplane ready for taxi. The Captain called back to the flight attendants to check on the door and maybe try to recycle it. We sat there as we heard the Flight Attendant try to get the door shut. After a few seconds of messing with the door; I heard a loud hiss and the airplane started shaking. At that point we had determined that the slide had been deployed. The Flight Attendant then called to let us know what had happened. He tried opening the door and then closing it again. This was an honest mistake and had no malicious intent. It was an abnormal situation in a high pressure environment.The cause could've been a quick misinterpretation of wording between the crew. The FA (Flight Attendant) was told to recycle the door and I've heard that wording can be misinterpreted throughout the whole [company] fleet.Change the wording in the in-flight manual for the words 'recycling doors.' I've heard it can mean something different in all the airplanes and I guess maybe it was taken one way or [another] the night of the incident.,,After push back in ZZZ on Aircraft X; we had an accidental slide deployment. Prior to push back; I verified the doors were green and told the ramp crew we were cleared to push. As we started the number 1 engine; once it came online we received a 'DOOR SERVICE FWD OPEN' warning message. I called back to the flight attendants and the number one answered. I had interrupted the safety demo that he was already doing. There must have been a perceived miscommunication as the next thing I knew there was a slide deployment. Thankfully no one was hurt when this honest mistake occurred and there was no willful intent by any crew member to deploy the slide.I believe the cause was miscommunication on the interphone between the CA (Captain) and the number one FA (Flight Attendant.) A contributing factor was the delayed flight and a rushed turn at the outstation.In the future I intend to treat any door issue similar to this event with a better initial reaction. First words to the FA will be to ensure the door is disarmed while following procedures more specifically.,,ERJ-175 flight crew reported an inadvertent emergency slide deployment after pushback.,"The incident involved an ERJ-175 flight crew and a flight attendant during departure from ZZZ. After starting the first engine, a warning indicated a forward door was ajar. The flight crew communicated with the attendant to check and recycle the door. During this, the emergency slide deployed, an inadvertent deployment with no injuries. The cause was attributed to a miscommunication regarding the term ""recycle,"" leading to confusion. Contributing factors included a delayed flight and rushed procedures.

I could not find verbiage regarding this particular device. Understanding it was a mobility device. Where it concerns me is Ops was not able to verify the type of battery in the device.,,Female passenger preboarded the aircraft using an assistive device that appeared to be a hoverboard with a handle. The A Flight Attendant (FA) inquired about the type of battery powering the device and the passenger didn't give a conclusive answer. She responded that in ZZZ; the ground staff consistently checked the device as checked baggage and in ZZZ1; they allowed her to stow the device in the wheelchair compartment; which was what I desired to do for her. The A FA and I communicated this to the Operations Agent; who curtly replied that TSA allowed it through and that he had tagged it to be checked. He never communicated with us that he had confirmed the type of battery inside the device and he verified that it was safe for travel in the cargo hold of the aircraft. If he had indeed safely verified he had checked the device thoroughly; he should have been able to answer the question about the type of battery powering the device and communicated that information with both the flight deck crew and the Flight Attendants. It is my belief that a potential safety violation occurred here; and if not; then the Operations Agent needed to communicate the information to the crew in a manner that allowed us to be sure that the device in question was carried safely.

The passenger had boarded the aircraft using the Segway, which the FA perceived as a hoverboard. The FA questioned the Operations Agent (Ops Agent) about the type of battery in the device, as it was unclear and potentially concerning for safety reasons. The Ops Agent stated that TSA had approved the device and that it had been tagged as checked baggage. However, the Ops Agent did not confirm the type of battery or communicate this information to the flight deck crew and cabin staff, leaving the crew uncertain about the safety of the device in the cargo hold. The flight attendant attempted to verify the device's classification in the manual but found no relevant information. The incident concluded with the device loaded in the cargo hold, and the crew remained unsure about its safety.

On the past five flights; Captains have insisted upon leaving the seat belt sign on for the entire flight. Some are so brazen they make an announcement prior to take-off advising the sign will be left on for the entire flight! Keep in mind; flying times range between 6.5 to 9.5 hours. On past flights; I have attempted to employ/educate using CRM strategies with some Captains in order to understand their reasoning behind their actions of keeping the sign on. Most express concerns about liability related to passenger injury due to unexpected severe turbulence. Others state they are doing flight attendants a favor by not cycling the sign off during late night flights - minimizing need for compliance checks. I'm deeply concerned the negative safety culture this type of behavior is creating -- a dangerous risk for passengers and crew. It encourages passengers to disobey the sign while fostering complacency among flight attendants. For example; during my last flight; FAs stopped enforcing the requirement for passengers to be buckled due to the sign being constantly on and lack of turbulence. Their reasoning (understandable); belts were unnecessary due to the smooth ride. At one point; I counted at least 15 passengers in the aisle while the sign was on. This occurred about seven hours into the flight; following the breakfast service. Clearly a violation of 121.311 and portions of 121.571. I witnessed this more often on long range flights.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant expressed concern in regard to the overuse of the seat belt.,"The incident involves concerns raised by a flight attendant regarding the excessive use of the seat belt sign by flight deck crews, particularly captains, on multiple flights. The flight attendant reported that captains frequently left the seat belt sign on for the entire duration of flights, which ranged between 6.5 to 9.5 hours. Some captains even made pre-flight announcements about this practice. The flight attendant attempted to address this issue with the captains using CRM strategies, but the captains cited concerns about liability in case of severe turbulence and claimed they were minimizing compliance checks for flight attendants during late-night flights as reasons for their actions. The flight attendant expressed deep concern over the negative safety culture this behavior was fostering, as it encouraged passengers to ignore the seat belt sign and created complacency among flight attendants. During one flight, the flight attendant observed at least 15 passengers in the aisle while the seat belt sign was on, approximately seven hours into the flight, following breakfast service. This situation violated Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 121.311 and portions of 121.571. The flight attendant noted that this behavior occurred more frequently on long-range flights.

I was unable to turn my head around to see; but I heard the request; and we were ready to close the entry door; so I stated that it was okay to close the door. The door subsequently closed; and we went on our way to ZZZ1. After the entry door was closed; but prior to closing the cockpit door; the Number 1 Flight Attendant advised me that the door had been closed by the agent without her permission. I told her what had happened; and we noted that there had been a miscommunication. After the flight; in ZZZ1 during the debrief; we noted that the agent should not have closed the door without talking to the Number 1 Flight Attendant. Also noted was the fact that due to the busy and crowded flight deck; and the difficulty for me to turn around; and see if the person asking if it was clear to close; I apparently had given clearance to close to the agent and not the Flight Attendant. We agreed that agent was in the wrong to have closed the door without coordinating with the Number 1 Flight Attendant.Agent closed the door without the consent of the Number 1 Flight Attendant. This occurred because the agent failed to follow the correct procedure. The Flight Attendant is supposed to close the door; not the agent.Agents need to be trained that they must have the Number 1 Flight Attendant there to close the entry door. Pilots should make every effort to see that the person they are giving clearance to close is the Number 1 Flight Attendant and not the agent; although; as I stated this can be difficult to do at times with a busy crowded cockpit and doorway. The most important thing is that the agents not close the door without the Flight Attendant.,,,,A319-100 Captain reported the gate CSR did not follow company policy during the final passenger boarding procedures.,"The incident involved a miscommunication during the final boarding procedures of an A319-100 flight, where the entry door was closed by ground personnel without the consent of the Number 1 Flight Attendant. The pilot, unable to visually confirm who was requesting clearance due to a busy cockpit, assumed it was the Flight Attendant and granted permission. However, it was later discovered that the ground agent had closed the door, violating company policy, which mandates that the Flight Attendant must authorize such actions. During the post-flight debrief, it was determined that the ground personnel were at fault for not coordinating with the Flight Attendant. The crew acknowledged the challenge pilots face in confirming identities in a crowded cockpit. To prevent future occurrences, it was agreed that ground personnel should be trained to follow proper procedures and wait for the Flight Attendant's authorization before closing the door. Additionally, pilots were encouraged to make every effort to confirm the identity of the person requesting clearance, highlighting the importance of clear communication protocols. This incident underscores the need for enhanced training and communication to ensure adherence to company policies, emphasizing the crucial role of the Flight Attendant in such procedures.",communication issues

As we were ready to close the cockpit door; the A F/A (Flight Attendant) stated that we had 139 + 1 infant. I conferred with the [Gate] Agent; and confirmed with our F/A's that the infant was in fact in a lap and not in a seat. After a discussion on the radio; the [Gate] Agent confirmed that we did in fact have 139 + 1; as one boarding pass had not been scanned; even though that passenger had boarded. She sent us Version 2 of the Takeoff Data with the updated count; we re-accomplished the Before Push Checklist; and the flight proceeded normally.GENERAL SAFETY CONCERN: This isn't the first time I've had this situation occur. It's easiest to catch on full or nearly full flights with a senior 'C' F/A who still counts the number of empty seats before pushback. Various things can set up the situation where this error can occur; a boarding pass that isn't scanned will do it; or an [Gate] Agent who assumes that the thru count is correct without verifying can cause it as well. I've seen that too; the deplaning F/A's got a thru-count; but the [Gate] Agent never asked for it; and the oncoming F/A's were never asked or told what it was. The [Gate] Agent blindly assumed that the count was right; and she was wrong. (That error got caught because it occurred before the final passenger count was abolished.) With current procedures; if the thru-count is off and the subsequent flight isn't full; NOTHING will catch this sort of error after it gets made. 'What's the thru-count supposed to be? 28. Yeah; we have 28.' (No; you have 29; because the 4th Rider; in a seat; is staying on even though the operational information system thinks she's getting off here; but you didn't catch it because another passenger was using the lav when you counted and you weren't aware of it. Or because you got distracted during the count; and it was like 27 or 28 or something; and it's easier to say 'yeah; we have 28' than to go back and count again.) These errors happen ALL THE TIME; but now we are generally oblivious to them; whereas before the procedure change; 'count's off; have to count again' was common. Sometimes the F/A's count before push was simply off and the recount straightened everything out; but other times there was a real discrepancy between the number of people that the computer had on the aircraft; and the true number. The ramifications of errors like this are two-fold. First; the aircraft is operated with an inaccurate ZFW (Zero Fuel Weight) and Takeoff Gross Weight. This means that the aircraft is operated in a non-compliant manner with certainty; even though the actual impact of a 200 or even 400 pound error is essentially nil. Second; however; in the event of an aircraft accident; having an accurate count of Souls On Board can be absolutely vital; and an inaccurate count may be the difference between leaving someone on the aircraft who could be rescued; or sending a firefighter into an aircraft in search of an individual who was never there in the first place. In other words; an accurate count makes no difference whatsoever; until that one day when it is of life and death importance. It frankly astounds me that; at the same time that we obsess over 97 bags versus 98 bags (at 50 pounds each); with elaborate checks and verification between the ramp agents and the [Gate] Agent; we willingly forgo the best and only verification of what the computer says about our number of passengers (at 200 pounds each). How the FAA can require no counting of people actually onboard the aircraft at the same time they require exact accountability of bags; is beyond me. An extra passenger; as we had today; is four times as consequential in terms of aircraft weight as an extra bag; and infinitely more important as a soul to be rescued and accounted for in the event of an accident.The FAA should require Company to return to the previous practice of counting the actual number of people who are physically onboard the aircraft prior to pushing back from the gate. Yes; those counts take time; and when a Flight Attendant miscounts; it takes time to resolve the error. But; isn't an accurate count of the number of lives in our care worth it?,,,,B737 Captain reported an inaccurate passenger count prior to departure.,"An incident occurred involving a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding an inaccurate passenger count prior to departure. The flight captain noticed a discrepancy in the ""Souls On Board"" count, initially reporting 144 souls (138 passengers, 1 infant, and 5 crew) based on the Weight and Balance report. The flight attendant, however, stated there were 139 passengers plus an infant. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the infant was in a lap, not a seat. The flight crew consulted with the gate agent and verified the counts. A boarding pass had not been scanned, leading to the error. The gate agent confirmed the count and provided an updated Takeoff Data version, prompting a recalculation of the Before Push Checklist. The flight proceeded normally after the resolution. The flight captain highlighted that such discrepancies often occur due to unverified boarding passes or gate agents assuming counts are accurate without confirmation. They emphasized the critical importance of accurate passenger counts for aircraft weight calculations and emergency response, proposing that the FAA require a return to physically counting passengers before departure, despite the time it may take. This practice, the captain argued, ensures the safety and accurate accounting of lives on board.",communication issues

I was given a shuttle to the maintenance hangar to get onboard. When the FO and I had everything ready; I opened my window to speak with the ground agent standing outside. He said he had never towed from here before; and he didn't have a headset or wing-walkers. We were parked tightly at an angle between other things; so I asked him if he could get a headset and helpers. I also called maintenance to see if they could send someone out to help the guy. Finally; [the ground agent] came back with a headset and helpers; and he was fabulous about getting us pulled out. We flew to ZZZ and landed just after midnight. We landed and were cleared to the gate. As we were about to turn left; an airport bus almost drove right in front of us going westbound along the road. I hit the brakes. He stopped; but he stopped too close for me to go past him. I flashed all my lights at him and we told ground about that happened. The vehicle behind the bus flashed lights several times. We all needed him to back up but he didn't get it. Then he gunned it and drove right in front of us. We told ground; and I called the tower to clarify the details after landing. The bus was a blue and white design. When we arrived at [the] gate; the agent had positioned the jetway and then left. So we had to wait about 15 minutes for an agent to come and let us out of the jetway in order to avoid setting off security alarms.

The flight attendant reported being sent messages about a reassignment to an empty airplane and subsequent flights.

The flight attendant had to apply brakes abruptly to avoid collision. Despite communication with ground personnel and the tower, the bus driver did not comply, creating a safety hazard. The aircraft was eventually positioned at the gate, but the ground agent left the jetway unattended, requiring a 15-minute wait for assistance to avoid triggering security alarms. The flight attendant recommended that ground personnel, particularly bus drivers, be informed to yield to aircraft to prevent similar incidents.",communication issues

Flight was delayed another 40 minutes; but they then shortened the block from 2:31 to 2:10 and had us arriving even earlier with a later departure time. We were on hold with Scheduling when they called me asking if I wanted to go over 16 hours; I responded no. I find this a safety issue; we were definitely fatigued and they were trying to push us past the limit.,,,,CRJ Flight Attendant reported the company manipulated block time to remain within the required work period.,"A conflict occurred between a CRJ flight attendant and the crew scheduling department regarding the manipulation of block time for a trip originating from JFK. The flight attendant reported that the crew scheduling adjusted the block time to keep the operation within the 16-hour work period, despite the crew having already waited over five hours at JFK for the aircraft to arrive. The attendant and a coworker were informed that they were approaching the 26-hour mark and were at 15:43 hours when contacted. Although the flight was delayed by an additional 40 minutes, the block time was shortened, resulting in an earlier arrival but a later departure. The flight attendant expressed concern over this scheduling decision, citing fatigue and safety risks, and refused to work beyond the 16-hour limit. The attendant viewed the situation as a safety issue due to the potential impact of fatigue on crew performance. No specific solution was proposed in the context provided.",communication issues

We arrived at the aircraft and passenger boarding began without any crew briefing from the Captain. Upon door closure; we were notified that the ramp was closed; and we would be sitting for at least 15 minutes; potentially more. I called the cockpit to see if our brake was released (wondering; 'are we receiving flight pay/ATC hold pay for this delay?'). The Captain informed us that 'No-we aren't getting paid a penny to sit here!' We finally were able to leave the gate. Upon taxiing out; we were notified that we would not be departing for some time. We parked and the engines were shut down at some point. The passengers moved about the cabin to the lavatories during this delay. Approximately one hour later; the engines came back on and we heard the announcement 'Prepare for takeoff.' We made an announcement for passengers to return to their seats and bring their seatbacks and tray tables forward; as well as to stow laptops.While conducting our compliance check; I noticed that we were turning onto the runway and beginning to accelerate. The Number 4 Flight Attendant and I struggled to get to our jumpseats as the airplane was taking off. Following take off; there was a substantial amount of turbulence during the climb out. I called the Number 1 Flight Attendant and asked if they had heard a chime before takeoff. They had NOT; and indicated they had been scrambling to get to their jumpseats in time; as well. The Captain finally called to indicate it was probably safe to get up. I called him back to tell him that we were all in the aisle during takeoff; and that we did not hear a takeoff chime. He immediately defended himself; saying 'YES WE DID; we said prepare and chimed;' to which I replied 'Regardless; four of us did NOT hear the chime; and we were in the aisle during takeoff.' He told me that we would 'have a discussion on the ground.'Upon landing the Captain made no comment to us; and when the Number 4 Flight Attendant asked if we were going to discuss what had happened in the crew van; the Captain answered with a loud 'NO!' Pilots should always verify if the cabin is ready for takeoff following a significant delay and sit on the tarmac. A pilot briefing should always be conducted; even if flight is delayed.,,,,B737-800 Flight Attendant reported not receiving the proper pre-takeoff warning from the cockpit.,"The incident involved a B737-800 flight where the cabin crew reported not receiving the proper pre-takeoff warning from the cockpit. The flight attendant, working a delayed flight, noticed that the cabin crew did not hear the takeoff chime despite the Captain claiming it was heard. This omission led to confusion and safety concerns during takeoff, as the cabin crew was still in the aisle when the aircraft began accelerating. The Captain defended his actions, but no resolution was reached post-landing. The flight attendant suggested that pilots should verify cabin readiness after delays and conduct briefings to prevent such issues.",communication issues

Zero forward visibility. Using weather radar. Seatbelt sign on. Occasional light turbulence. In the cabin; FA B (Flight Attendant) and FA C are standing in the rear galley. A paramedic and a nurse are assisting an ill passenger in seat 19b. Paramedics are waiting at destination. No ATC [notification was made].We see a small; individual cell ahead on radar: about 4 miles wide with light green rain indication and small amber center. We receive deviation clearance to the left from Control. We change course and continue descent. Visibility zero. When abeam of the cell on our right side; we flew through some imbedded cumulus and a short burst of rain. We received a quick; sudden jolt of moderate turbulence.I called back to the cabin via intercom to check with the cabin crew. I apologized about the event with no warning from us. I was assured that everything was okay although FA C sounded a bit unhappy about the event.We landed and arrived at the gate at [destination] with paramedics waiting to examine the ill passenger. A lot of confusion at the gate after the passengers deplaned with an army of cleaners coming aboard to 'turn' the aircraft. I saw FA A was moving aft to speak to FAs C and B while the cleaners and ground supervisors were on the airplane between us. The paramedics had left the jetway with the ill passenger. It was going to be difficult to wade through the cleaners to speak to my crew who were scheduled to fly the aircraft back to [origin]. Not having heard from them while at the gate; [First Officer] and I assumed our cabin crew were okay. We exited the aircraft to start our overnight.24 hours later; [First Officer] and I arrived at the aircraft for the northbound flight to [origin]. FA C and FA B were present and met us. It was then when we heard that they had sustained injury during the previous day while standing in the rear galley from the moderate turbulence jolt event. Both crew members complained of back and shoulder strain. In addition; FA C had sustained a small cut on her hand while grabbing a hand hold to steady herself.The event occurred because I failed to warn the cabin crew of possible moderate turbulence during descent. So; the crew was completing normal duties when the unexpected turbulence occurred. As is well known; turbulence effects are magnified when in the aft section of aircraft and also there was no warning of small bumps before the big jolt took place.I need to communicate better with my cabin crew during flight to warn them about turbulence ahead and also at the gate after such an event (by intercom; if necessary); to make sure that they are okay. I am not happy about my lack of knowledge about my cabin crew condition as I left the aircraft. One of my roles is to make sure they are okay and to assist them if they are not okay.,,,,A319 Captain reported learning the next day that Flight Attendants had been injured during an inbound turbulence encounter.,"An incident occurred during the descent of a flight, 100 miles north of the destination, where the flight crew encountered embedded thunderstorms with zero visibility. The flight crew deviated around a small thunderstorm cell, resulting in a sudden jolt of moderate turbulence. The cabin crew, including flight attendants B and C, were in the rear galley and were injured during the turbulence, sustaining back and shoulder strains, with FA C also receiving a minor hand injury. The incident was primarily due to the captain's failure to warn the cabin crew about the impending moderate turbulence, particularly considering the increased turbulence effects in the aft section of the aircraft. The flight crew descended through solid cirrus clouds, encountering light turbulence and using weather radar. Encountered a thunderstorm cell, leading to deviation and moderate turbulence. Cabin crew, assisting an ill passenger, were injured during the turbulence. Post-incident confusion at the gate hindered immediate communication with the cabin crew. The cabin crew sustained injuries, and the captain realized the need for improved communication regarding turbulence warnings and post-incident checks. Enhance communication with the cabin crew about upcoming turbulence and use the intercom to ensure their well-being after such events. The incident highlights the importance of timely warnings and effective communication to ensure the safety and well-being of the cabin crew during turbulent conditions.",communication issues

Captain failed to warn us of documented turbulence enroute [to] Oakland; failed to keep us seated throughout the flight; and Captain failed to keep us as safe as reasonably possible while performing our inflight responsibilities.Turbulence was both moderate and severe and lasted from the time we began drink service which we were unable to finish past one tray to the time we landed. It is inconceivable how the duration and severity of turbulence would not have been known to the Captain prior to flight. This is a heavily traveled route by both commercial and non-commercial air traffic and it is my understanding that turbulence of this nature should be included in the turbulence plots and weather briefings the Captain is required to obtain and share with his crew prior to departure.Secondly; were there no PIREPs indicating how severe and lengthy the frequency of turbulence was that evening? This is not the only time this has happened. In fact it occurs at [airline] every day practically. Captains in general almost never brief us on weather and when we ask if it will be okay to get up at 10;000 feet to begin service on short flights we are usually told yes. Then; we are bumped and rocked all over the place and never told to sit down until we are in the bad turbulence or the turbulence event has already occurred. We are not being given the weather briefings we deserve prior to flight and Captains are repeatedly not briefing us at all thus compromising our safety.In this particular instance; I woke up this morning with an aching back from the twisting and turning and jarring of my body during the turbulence. The Captain only communicated with us once the event was in full occurrence telling us to take our seats and to remain seated. We were not able to conduct any service beyond the one tray of drinks we in the back were able to distribute. The galley was a mess with spilled drinks everywhere and we were being thrown violently as we attempted to secure the galley.We were unable to collect garbage or secure the cabin for arrival due to the severity and duration of this event. Customers who purchased cocktails from me were never refunded their money because there was no way to do so safely. I ask why it is that the PIREPs of severe turbulence were not communicated to us by the Captain (as is all too often the norm); and why no preflight briefing was conducted by the Captain (also the norm at [airline]) . I also ask why it is we are required to serve drinks on very short flights and how that is considered safe. Some of our flights are barely 50 or 55 minutes block to block. We can't get up until 10;000 feet and must 1. Take drink orders 2. Pour the drinks 3. Balance trays with drinks on them and distribute them; then offer a snack service; conduct trash cleanup; offer seconds on drinks; again do a round of trash; and in addition restock the galleys on many flights. How is this safe?If you do the math the actual time we have to do all this is approximately 20 to 25 minutes and we are not allowed to simply do a water service. It appears safety of flight attendants is not a concern at [airline] as demonstrated by the overall lack of concern and failure of cockpit crews to brief us on matters paramount to our safety and managements disinterest in hearing how unsafe doing a full beverage service is on our shortest flights. When will you; the FAA; step up to the plate and hold our pilots responsible when they do not brief us even when there is an abundance of information available to us and when will you hold Management responsible for their unwillingness to deviate from unsafe practices?,,,,Flight Attendant reported not being informed in a timely manner or at crew briefing about turbulence reported along the flight path.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and the flight crew (Party2) regarding safety practices and communication during a flight. The flight attendant reported that the captain failed to conduct a pre-flight weather briefing or general briefing, did not warn the crew about documented turbulence along the route to Oakland, and allowed the flight attendants to move about the cabin despite severe turbulence. The turbulence, which lasted from the start of drink service to landing, was described as both moderate and severe, with the flight attendant experiencing physical strain and being unable to complete their duties safely. The flight attendant also criticized the lack of timely communication from the captain and questioned the safety practices, such as requiring full beverage service on short flights, which they argued compromised their safety. The flight attendant raised concerns about the captain's failure to brief the crew on known turbulence, the absence of pre-flight briefings, and the systemic issues within the airline, including the lack of action from management and the FAA to address these practices. The flight attendant requested that the FAA hold the captain and management accountable for these unsafe practices and ensure safer working conditions for flight attendants. In summary, the incident stemmed from a failure to provide timely and adequate safety briefings, leading to a hazardous work environment for the flight attendant and highlighting broader safety concerns within the airline.",communication issues

First passenger was seated in 8C with cabin pet in carryon kennel. Second passenger was 25A with small dog tucked under her coat. First Animal; [seat] 8: [The] dog remained in kennel for entire flight and did not cause disruptions. However; what caught my attention during boarding was passenger had to swap seats (at my recommendation) with 9D due to 8C's kennel unable to fit under her seat. The kennel was blocked due to the IFE power box under 8C. It should also be noted that PETC [Pet in Cabin] was not discovered as undocumented until inflight; thus ZZZ ground staff was not alerted about this animal prior to departure.Second animal [seat] 25A: Requested [passenger's] seat number as she boarded since I had not noted no pets on the Special Services List during preflight briefing. As boarding continued; I refreshed my Flight Attendant tablet to check if passengers with dogs were a last minute add to the manifest. However [passenger] was checked-in but no reference to ESA or SVAN [Emotional Support Animals and Service] on The Tablet seat map. Also; [I] referenced a fresh copy of the Special Services list no documentation.  I then contacted the female gate agent via phone and advised that we had a passenger with an undocumented cabin pet aboard while providing seat assignment. Prior to door closure; I witnessed [customer service representative] come onboard and question [the passenger].  I overheard him asked what type of service passenger's animal provided. The passenger responded; but I was unable to hear her answer. Later noted after landing that passenger's PNR had been updated reflecting her dog was a medic alert animal -- thus making it a SVAN. However; the dog had no exterior badging; vest; harness; or leash to keep the animal under control during the flight. The passenger simply cradled the dog in her arms during the flight.  As noted in the FA Inflight Manual; SVAN are to remain on leash or harness under passengers control at all times for safety.The main focus of this report is to express extreme concern on how two animals: 1 PETC and 1 SVAN were permitted to board the flight completely undetected by the ZZZ ground staff. Of even greater concern; PETC was in cabin kennel during the boarding process thus clearly visible to agents working the flight. Further; SVAN was permitted in the cabin without the correct restraint thus creating an injury risk to passengers and crew.Report filed due to personal safety/injury risk to passengers/crew with dog permitted to board without proper restraint requirements (leash/harness/vest). It also appears this animal was not correctly documented as a SVAN due to last minute add to PNR.,,,,B737-800 Flight Attendant reported 2 dogs being brought onboard without proper paperwork or notification from the gate agent.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party 1) and ground personnel (Party 2) regarding two passengers boarding a B737-800 aircraft with dogs that were not properly documented or restrained. During boarding, the flight attendant observed a passenger in seat 8C with a pet in a carry-on kennel and another passenger in seat 25A with a small dog under her coat. The first dog remained in the kennel for the entire flight without causing disruptions, but the passenger had to swap seats due to the kennel being blocked by an IFE power box under seat 8C. The second dog, later identified as an emotional support animal (ESA), was not documented as such on the passenger's manifest or special services list. Although the passenger was checked in, there was no reference to the ESA or service animal (SVAN) on the flight attendant's tablet or the special services list. The flight attendant notified the gate agent about the undocumented ESA and observed a customer service representative boarding the aircraft to inquire about the animal. After the flight, it was discovered that the passenger's PNR had been updated to reflect the dog as a SVAN, but the animal was not properly restrained, as required by safety protocols, and lacked any visible identification or control gear. The flight attendant expressed concern over the lack of proper documentation and restraint, which posed a safety risk to passengers and crew. The report was filed to address the safety risk associated with the un restrained animal and the failure to properly document the ESA. The flight attendant recommended improving communication and compliance with documentation and restraint requirements to prevent similar incidents in the future.",communication issues

We had not yet completed our emergency demonstration when we received the single hi-lo chime from the flight deck that we were being cleared for departure. I knew that our procedure in these short taxis was to do the oxygen demonstration after takeoff. However; the Captain had communicated to us that we were expecting turbulence after takeoff; and that he would call us when it was safe to get up. Because of this; I continued with the emergency PA. I then began my final walkthrough; as it was my understanding that this always needs to be done. I had always seen other A flight attendants complete our pre-takeoff procedures even after we had received the single chime. I had reached the back half of the cabin when we started to accelerate into our takeoff. I was able to quickly get into an open seat and fasten my seatbelt; was not hurt in any way; and I returned to my jumpseat when it was safe to do so. Passengers and my fellow flight attendants saw this happen. Our C Flight Attendant was still in my field of view at the front of the cabin after I took a seat; and she rushed to take her jumpseat after we began accelerating into our takeoff. I debated calling the pilots during cruise to let them know that this had happened; but I was shaken up and upset and decided against it. I did bring it up with him while we deplaned at our destination. He was apologetic; and we both agreed that more communication on both of our parts would have benefited. The crew was not told that we would have a short taxi; and I did not communicate with the pilots that we were not ready to take off after we had received the chime. In my experience; it has always seemed like standard operating procedure for the pilots to wait for the A flight attendant to make the 'cleared for departure' PA before initiating takeoff; and if it is not made; for a call to be made to see what was going on in the cabin. The Captain had told me that ATC chatter had interfered with his ability to hear us making our PAs; and he thought we had made the 'cleared for departure' PA. Our C Attendant did ultimately make it after we were already in the process of taking off; and I was in a passenger seat. I consulted my manual when I got home; and did see where it says to signal the flight deck with 2 chimes and inform the pilots that we had not yet finished our emergency demonstration. Then; finish the oxygen demonstration after take off but below 25;000 ft. Again; that was not an option in this case because it was communicated to us that turbulence was expected on our ascent. Then; the manual says to exercise discretion on conducting the final walk through. I had elected to start my walk through after we had received the single hi-lo chime because I was under the impression that the walk through was always required prior to takeoff; and I do not recall being trained to not do it in any circumstances. Again; I had always finished all surface movement procedures before making the 'cleared for departure' PA; and had seen other A flight attendants do the same; even after receiving a hi-lo chime. And; I had never seen a plane take off without a flight attendant making the 'cleared for departure' PA; which is what happened in this case. Ultimately; this was a learning experience that got me to become more familiar with the manual's details in an unfamiliar situation that I had not yet encountered. In the future; I will communicate with the pilots if we are not ready for departure when we receive a hi-lo chime; and determine what procedures should be completed prior to taking my seat for departure. In my case; it was probably something that needed to happen for me to learn. I did not recall learning to not complete my walk through if we had received a hi-lo chime from the flight deck. If one has never been in a situation like this; the manual's language to 'exercise discretion on conducting the final walk through' does not easily connect to areal world situation where that discretion should be applied. It never would have occurred to me that not 'exercising discretion' could result in me being caught in the middle of the cabin during takeoff. Now that I have referred to the relevant section of the manual after this experience; I am prepared to handle this situation correctly in the future; both through more communication with the flight deck as well as my 'discretion.',,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported not immediately seating after receiving pre-takeoff chime notification.,"The incident involved a miscommunication between the flight attendant and the flight crew. The flight attendant, following standard procedures, began the final walkthrough after receiving the pre-takeoff chime, unaware that the Captain had been unable to hear their safety announcement due to ATC interference. As a result, the flight attendant found themselves in the cabin during takeoff, necessitating them to sit in a passenger seat temporarily. Post-incident, the flight attendant and Captain agreed on the need for improved communication and adherence to procedures. The flight attendant committed to enhancing communication with the flight deck and following manual guidelines more diligently in future situations.",communication issues

I had a few passengers ask if I needed help but I was not going to put anyones safety in danger due to a pilot error.,,The safety department contacted me to inform me that a communication chime was not received or heard by the flight attendant in the landing phase. This may have led to a situation where a service cart could have been unsecured during landing.The flight was the last of four legs for the flight crew. The transition to this leg was expedited due to some delays impacting the arriving leg. As a result; the flight crew boarded the airplane with the passengers already loaded and the Flight Attendants already onboard. The Captain deliberately stated on multiple occasions to me 'No rush.' To the best of my knowledge; all checklists; SOPs; Chimes; etc. where accomplished completely; deliberately and without rush. To my recollection; the arrival chimes where accomplished; however; there is no aural feedback in the flight deck that I could reference for their accomplishment.

As a result, the beverage cart was still out in the cabin during landing. Party1 instructed another flight attendant to secure the cart as quickly as possible, but due to safety concerns related to the imminent landing, they prioritized securing the cart and ensuring passenger safety. The flight crew, however, maintained that all checklists, including chimes, were completed in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOPs). They emphasized that the arrival chime was broadcasted over the public address (PA) system and that no procedures were rushed despite delays.

FA (Flight Attendant) X was not in compliance the first day of work. [She] was eating out of first class basket before anyone was served; not briefing the exit row before main cabin door was closed and texting once she finished her service. The second day; FA X was working first class. When we arrived in ZZZ with almost a four hours and a half sit; I arrived in the crew lounge and was watching TV. FA X came in shortly after me [while] I was watching TV and texting. I look up and FA X pulls the plug from the TV and I said to FA X why are you behaving like this?FA X said you are not watching TV and I said I was and did not appreciate her behavior and she said she would do again if I turn the TV back on and she did for a second time. This time ripped it out of the wall and I said to FA X you are being disrespectful and to not do that again. She left the room; came back at the same time another crew member came in the room. She had her phone so loud. FA Y said would you please turn your phone down. She said that the volume was on the lowest setting for her phone. FA Y offered FA X headphones. She said they would not work on her phone. The show FA X was watching was using profanity every other word and it was very loud. Any crew member who walked in immediately walked out and sat outside the crew room. FA Y and myself left the room. We both felt very uncomfortable with FA X's behavior. The crew room is supposed to be a place to rest and relax. I did not feel comfortable with FA X's behavior [and] called my manager and explained what had happened and to see if once we arrived [at our destination;] if another FA could take her place. The manager said I know you have high expectations and informed me this was a CRM [issue] and we needed to work things out. Requested at some point to send an email in regards to what happened. When we arrived in ZZZ1; it was late and I was very tired and had an early report the next day. Did not have time to do a report in regards to the CRM. Following our ZZZ sit; I arrived to the aircraft for our next trip to ZZZ1; FA X said we needed to make it through these next 2 days. She was not sure what came over her in the crew room. I agreed with FA X let's work together. We performed our safety demo and part of the demo was to wear the life vest and performed how to wear the vest. FA X would only hold the vest during our demo. After our demo; I mentioned she needs to wear it versus holding it. On the third day of our first leg; FA X was leaving bins half open and the closet door open. This happened more than 8 times and had requested to please make sure they are closed and locked. She would just look at me and walked away. The service cart was left unattended at the exit row. FA X left her service cart and walk to the front galley and called the flight deck. I saw the cart sitting in the aisle at row 12. We did have turbulence on and off during the flight. I walk back to the cart and checked with passengers for service. She was requesting [that] a passenger wanted to purchase Pringles. Prior to FA X making the call to the flight deck; FA X had touched the FA call button twice in a row and I held my index finger to say give me a minute with okay I will be there. I was in the middle of my service with first class.I was not comfortable and felt the safety on the aircraft for the passengers and myself was not safe and FA X would not comply with the safety of the aircraft. I had requested for a manager to meet the aircraft once we arrived at our destination due to the situation through ACARS.I was not sure what the reason was for her calling the flight deck. I spoke to the flight deck in regards to problems of safety in flight. FA X called the flight deck and said I was ignoring her and not helping her on requested items. I explained as before; I was serving first class and [I] would be there shortly. I said to the CA (Captain) [that]there was a communication problem and FA X was leaving bins opened and unlocked service cart left in the aisle at row 12. FA X walked up to [the] galley to call the flight deck and left the cart in the aisle. I requested the flight deck to please notify ACARS there was an issue with safety on board and FA X was not keeping the bins closed and locked; left her cart at the exit row and not talking to me. After FA X's service in the main cabin; she began texting on her phone for the remainder of the flight and would not respond to me.On arrival; two regional managers came to the aircraft to talk and discuss the issues. I had explained to FA X; once all passengers had left the aircraft; a manager would be coming to talk with us in regards to our flight. Before I could address the reason for the call; FA X started the conversation in regards to the incident in ZZZ crew room and made false accusations in regards to what happened to the point of making up things that did not occur. The main reason for the meeting was to discuss the safety issues. I explained the issues of FA X not listening to my request to please lock and close all bins and several occasions to please close the closet door after she opened it to remove an item. The manager asked if we both could work this flight together if not; and you choose not to; you will have a missed trip and a meeting with a manager. FA X said she was okay and I said I had a problem flying with FA X from inflight safety as well making false accusations that did not occur.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that the work environment was very stressful due to the cabin crew pairing.,"The incident involved two flight attendants, FA X and FA Y, on a flight operated by an air carrier. FA Y reported that the work environment became increasingly stressful due to FA X's non-compliant and disrespectful behavior. On the first day, FA X violated protocols by eating from the first-class basket before service, failing to brief the exit row, and texting after completing her duties. The following day, during a layover, FA X disrupted the crew lounge by unplugging the TV, leading to a confrontation. FA X's behavior in the crew room was deemed disrespectful and uncomfortable by other crew members, prompting FA Y to contact management and request a replacement. Despite management's suggestion to resolve the CRM issues, FA Y did not file a report due to fatigue. Subsequent days saw continued non-compliance from FA X, including failing to secure bins, leaving the service cart unattended, and making disruptive calls to the flight deck. During turbulence, FA X was observed texting and ignoring safety protocols, leading FA Y to inform the flight deck about safety concerns. Upon arrival, managers met with the crew, where FA X made false accusations. The managers facilitated a discussion, with both agreeing to continue working together, though FA Y expressed ongoing concerns about safety and false allegations. In summary, the incident stemmed from FA X's repeated non-compliance and disrespectful behavior, leading to a CRM breakdown. Management介入 aimed to address the issues, but FA Y's concerns about safety and accuracy highlighted the need for continued attention.",communication issues
1402038,Aircraft X,General Seating Area,Air Carrier,Flight Attendant In Charge,Flight Attendant Current,,Boarding,Communication Breakdown,Party1 Flight Attendant; Party2 Flight Attendant,1402038,,,,,,,,,,,,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Security,,Y,Person Flight Attendant,Aircraft In Service At Gate,,Procedure; Human Factors,Human Factors,After the Main Cabin (MC) beverage service and pick up was complete FA4 (Flight Attendant) called me (FA1) and notified me that [a] Passenger (PAX) did not return to the aircraft after she deplaned during boarding. She had deplaned to retrieve her uncle's medication from the security check point (located in main terminal). We departed; requiring a tram ride from main terminal; where security is located. I was completely unaware a passenger had deplaned during boarding--I was busy doing catering checks; prepping galley; loading ovens; pre-departure beverages; making PA's etc. FA3 was occupied hanging coats and serving the drinks. Boarding was going on this entire time. FA4 stated she believed FA3 and I were aware a PAX had deplaned because boarding was held up briefly for PAX to come forward through First Class to deplane. I was not aware of this; FA2 stated he thought the passenger was coming forward to give a bag to the agent for checking. He stated as the PAX rounded the closet with her bag he proceeded back down the aisle to perform his duties so did not actually see the PAX deplane. Apparently there was an agent at the door but I had zero awareness of any of these goings on. I was task saturated. FA4 states she told PAX to take her carryon baggage and tell the agent what she was doing. Upon my awareness of the incident I spoke to the remainder of her traveling party. My conversation with family confirmed [the] PAX had deplaned with carry on; she had checked luggage; she did not return to aircraft; she returned to main terminal security check point to retrieve [her uncle's] medication kit bag; and she did not make it back to the plane. Family had been in text contact with her and their main concern was how would she get out of ZZZ; what flight would she be on? When asked why they did not notify the cabin crew that PAX had not returned before we left the gate [the uncle] said essentially 'we knew the plane would wait anyway.' I said that may or may not be the case depending on where she was in the process; but we really needed to account for her; for security sake and for her sake and for your peace of mind. They were very kind and calm about the incident; their only concern was how/when [she] would get to [destination].I then briefed the Captain with all I knew of the incident. He was able to contact dispatch and confirm that the PAX was #1 on the Stand By list for [another] flight; with that flight showing 4 open seats at the time. I informed [the uncle]. They continued to text and make positive contact at various times; to include upon landing.Besides the obvious breach in procedure; potential security concerns; and anxiety for the family-the Captain and I became concerned about how many souls we actually had on board. At door close the agent first said 149. Then another agent came back down and said 151; but didn't explain how/why it changed. Then door closed. So now...with PAX deplaning and NOT returning...how many Souls On Board did we really have?In retrospect I recalled an agent stating something to the effect of all the passengers having made it 'except for that one.' I don't know if that is in reference to [the deplaning PAX] or another revenue passenger who didn't make the flight. A 'time-out' to ensure all FAs are aware of what is happening- especially FA1 who is ultimately responsible for ensuring procedure is properly followed. Boarding should have been stopped- FA4 should have escorted the PAX and handed her off to me; or directly to the agent who was standing by; but definitely brief me on the situation. Communication. Slow down. Be deliberate. I feel awful about this event- I feel bad for the family. I am terrified that I let this happen on my watch for the security implication of such an incident. Thankful it had an innocent outcome; but I realize how serious it could be. I have learned a great deal and will include this in my future preflight briefings with my crews. Also; if the plane had crashed...how many pairs of shoes ARE we looking for? That scares me too. I don't know as anyone really knows and am beyond thankful that did not happen. Ask the captain--I was shaken to the core about this for those very reasons and the implications therein. The responsibility weighs heavy and I accept it completely. I feel terrible for what happened and am thankful there were no worse outcomes than some worry and inconvenience for the family. Lesson learned. Thank you.,,,,An Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that she was notified by another Flight Attendant that a passenger did not return to the aircraft after she deplaned during boarding.,"An incident occurred during a flight operation involving two flight attendants (FA1 and FA4) and a passenger who deplaned during boarding but did not return to the aircraft. The passenger had left the aircraft to retrieve her uncle's medication from the security checkpoint in the main terminal. FA1 was unaware of the situation due to being occupied with pre-flight tasks, such as catering checks, galley preparation, and loading ovens. FA3, another flight attendant, believed the passenger was returning a bag to the agent and did not notice her deplaning. FA4 notified FA1 of the incident after the fact. FA1 informed the passenger's family, who confirmed that the passenger had not returned to the aircraft and was at the security checkpoint. The family expressed concern about how the passenger would reach her destination. FA1 briefed the captain, who confirmed that the passenger was on the standby list for another flight with available seats. Despite the resolution, the incident raised concerns about communication protocols, the number of souls on board, and potential security risks. The flight attendant expressed regret for the lapse in procedure and acknowledged the importance of clear communication and halting boarding to ensure all passengers were accounted for. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and adherence to safety protocols among the flight attendant team. The flight attendant committed to incorporating this lesson into future pre-flight briefings and emphasized the importance of ensuring passenger accountability for safety and security.",communication issues

We called the flight attendants and (in accordance with standard operating procedures) the FO stepped out of the cockpit and a FA came in; closing the cockpit door behind him. While the FO was in the lavatory; a female passenger came up to the forward galley. The FA informed her that she must use one of the lavatories in the back of the aircraft or return to her seat; but that she could not remain in the forward galley. The passenger was Hispanic and claimed not to understand the FA. Luckily; all three of the FAs spoke fluent Spanish and it was again explained in Spanish. The passenger still refused to move and she verbally abused and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA came up to assist. The 'A' FA called up to inform me what was going on. I could hear loud voices over the interphone and the FAs speaking to the passenger in Spanish. Meanwhile; the FO had exited the lavatory and was now also in the galley. After several more minutes; the passenger's husband came up and convinced her to return to her seat. After she was seated and with the three FAs plus the male deadheading FA guarding and blocking access to the forward galley and the cockpit door; the cockpit door was opened and the FA exited the cockpit and the FO entered. We then locked down the cockpit in accordance with a Threat Level 1. I contacted Dispatch with our status and requested to have law enforcement meet the aircraft in ZZZ. After arriving in ZZZ; law enforcement removed the passenger from the aircraft.After speaking with the FO over the interphone; and visually confirming the galley was secure; I determined that it was safer and more prudent to have the FO in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. This scenario needs to be addressed during recurrent security training. What is the safest course of action if the cockpit is locked down with one of the pilots in the cabin? If it is determined that keeping the cockpit on lockdown is the safest course; where should the FA sit? In the jumpseat or in a pilot seat?,The reporter stated that this encounter with a passenger was more of a misunderstanding; but it brought up the bigger issue of what to do if the threat is real. If a real threat was just outside the cockpit door with the first officer out of the cockpit with a single pilot and flight attendant in the cockpit; what is the proper procedure? Do you put the FA in the pilot's seat where they have access to the flight controls; but you can keep an eye on him/her? Do you put the FA in the jumpseat where you can't see them? The reporter mused 'could the FA be in on it'; what is really happening on the other side of the door? The reporter stated that he feels unprepared for which procedure should the pilot use for these type of scenarios. He feels more training should occur addressing these issues.,,,B737-800 Captain reported that a passenger refused to leave the forward galley while the First Officer was using the forward lavatory causing a security issue.,"The incident occurred during the cruise phase of a B737-800 flight about 45 minutes prior to landing at ZZZ. The First Officer (FO) required a physiological break and temporarily left the cockpit to use the forward lavatory. A flight attendant (FA) entered the cockpit in accordance with standard procedures, closing the door behind them. During the FO's absence, a Hispanic passenger approached the forward galley. The FA instructed the passenger to either use one of the rear lavatories or return to her seat, as she was not permitted to remain in the galley. The passenger, who did not understand English, was initially uncooperative. However, the three FAs, who spoke fluent Spanish, repeatedly explained the situation. Despite this, the passenger refused to comply, verbally abused, and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA was called to assist. The 'A' FA informed the Captain via interphone, who heard loud voices and ongoing dialogue between the FAs and the passenger in Spanish. The FO, having exited the lavatory, joined the situation in the galley. After several minutes, the passenger's husband intervened and persuaded her to return to her seat. With the passenger seated and the FAs, including the male deadheading FA, positioned to block access to the forward galley and cockpit door, the cockpit door was opened. The FA exited the cockpit, and the FO returned. The cockpit was then secured in accordance with Threat Level 1 protocols. Upon arrival at ZZZ, law enforcement was summoned to remove the passenger from the aircraft. The Captain, after consulting with the FO and visually confirming the galley's security, determined it was safer for the FO to remain in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. The incident highlighted the need for recurrent security training, particularly addressing scenarios where the cockpit is locked down with one pilot in the cabin. The discussion raised questions about the safest seating arrangement for an FA in such situations—whether in the jumpseat or a pilot seat.",communication issues

I directed the flight deck crew to don oxygen masks and set the regulators to 100 percent and established crew communication. I then [advised] ATC and asked for direct [destination]. Shortly thereafter; the Flight Attendants notified us that the device and its spare batteries (which were also in a state of thermal runaway) were contained in the ion battery emergency containment bag and there was no smoke.The device was apparently an e-cigarette. As the device was contained and there was no smoke; I elected to discontinue the QRH. However; the flight deck crew remained on oxygen for the duration of the approach and landing. Approach and landing were uneventful. My biggest concern is that after attempting to notify the Flight Attendants that we were on oxygen; I never called them back. They were making announcements on my first attempt and I simply dropped calling them back off my to-do list. They were surprised when we landed and were surrounded by Fire Rescue.Distraction management continues to be an issue for all flight crews. As a Check Airman; I should have done a better job of communicating. Better use of all my resources would have kept this from happening.

She told me the OPS agent closed the door. I reopened the door as the cabin was not secure. I made another PA asking for people to move. Two PAX were volunteering to move. I was assisting them in moving. When I started towards the front of the aircraft I saw that the forward entry door was again closed. I opened the door again. I then went into the jet way. Going back into the cabin the OPS agent for the third time; shut the door. (FA name) told me that she told the OPS agent that we could not close the door until the cabin was secured. I went into the jet way and said to the OPS agent; 'I don't know if you are aware of the FAR; but we cannot close the FWD entry door until all PAX are seated and all bags are stowed'; She said; 'Well; shut your mouth; get on the plane and mind your own business'; while shooing me with her hands. I walked onto the threshold of the aircraft with my back facing the FWD entry door and she let the door fall into the cabin. The door was so close it grazed my hair. I went into the cockpit and told the Captain I wanted to speak to a Supervisor. When the Supervisor arrived I told him what happened. The OPS agent told the Supervisor that the wind blew the door closed. With 100% certainty; I know that the FWD door was flush against the fuselage and the gust lock was securing the door. I told the Supervisor and the OPS agent that I believed she did it intentionally. (FA name) told the Supervisor that I spoke to the agent respectfully prior to her letting the door fall in the cabin. (FA name) also told the Supervisor that the agent did the same thing to her as she was bending down to make a PA and the she had to dodge the door to keep it from hitting her head.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that the Operations Agent insisted on closing the aircraft's main cabin door while passengers were still standing. Ground Ops Supervisor was called to rectify the situation.,"The incident occurred between a flight attendant (Party1) and ground personnel (Party2) during the boarding process of a flight with 127 passengers. The flight attendant was assisting a non-English speaking woman with an infant and needed to find two adjacent seats for the family. Despite making multiple announcements requesting volunteers to move, the flight attendant faced difficulties in securing the cabin. During this time, the ground personnel (OPS agent) repeatedly closed the forward entry door before the cabin was fully secured, disregarding the flight attendant's instructions to wait until all passengers were seated and bags stowed. The OPS agent dismissed the flight attendant's concerns and even shooed her away, causing the door to nearly hit her. The flight attendant reported the incident to the captain, who then summoned a Ground Operations Supervisor. The OPS agent claimed the door closed due to wind, but the flight attendant and another crew member disputed this, stating the door was manually closed. The situation was ultimately resolved with the supervisor's intervention.",communication issues

After engine start; FA called us to inform us a passenger was vomiting in the lavatory. We waited a few minutes; as we were behind traffic anyway and couldn't taxi. The Captain and I discussed returning to the gate; and decided if the passenger was still in the lav in 5 minutes; or if when they came out they were not feeling well; we'd return to the gate. After 2 minutes; the FA called and reported she was out and feeling better. We asked 'are you sure?' The FA said yes. We taxied; took off; and flew for an hour and 20 minutes without incident. At this time; they called to report our meals were ready. I asked about the ill passenger; and the FA told me there were 20-25 sick people in the back. Vomiting; diarrhea; etc. At this point; we knew we had an issue. We asked them for as much info as possible; if the people knew each other; stayed at the same resort; etc. It was then we learned people boarded the aircraft complaining of illness. This is the first time we heard any of this. I'm truly not trying to throw anyone under the bus; but it was frustrating to find out these details so late in the flight; where we are an hour from the nearest airport with few options. At this point; we requested direct [to destination] and tried to get a patch to MEDLINK. We were on the boundary of HF and VHF; so we never got a clear signal on the VHF frequency they gave us. The FAs came back that 3-4 passengers felt really sick; and the other 20 or so either felt off or had been sick in Puerto Plata. One had even been in the emergency room the night before in the Dominican Republic. Again; news to us. Most or all of the sick passengers stayed at the same resort. We got direct; were cleared visual [approach]; and parked offsite so the CDC could evaluate whether there was a bigger issue. After 40 minutes; they had evaluated the sickest passengers and determined we could go to the gate.,,[Report narrative contained no additional information.],,Air carrier flight crew reported unknowingly departing MDPP with 20-25 ill passengers.,"The flight crew departed from MDPP without prior knowledge of 20-25 ill passengers on board, who were experiencing symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. After receiving an initial report of a vomiting passenger, the crew briefly considered returning to the gate but proceeded after the passenger was reported feeling better. Approximately an hour and 20 minutes into the flight, the crew discovered that many passengers were unwell. With limited communication and options, they requested a direct flight to their destination and CDC evaluation. The flight was diverted, landed visually, and parked offsite for CDC evaluation. After assessing the sickest passengers, the CDC cleared the flight to proceed to the gate. The crew successfully diverted the flight and collaborated with the CDC to manage the situation, ensuring safe continuation of the journey.",communication issues

We were all waiting at the gate. We saw a mutual friend of ours who was jump seating on our flight. As the passengers were deplaning we started to get our bags ready and the gate agent announces over the intercom for us to 'report to the gate'. We were walking in uniform down the jet bridge. The other crew was leaving in a timely manner. The cleaners were not off yet and the gate agent starts boarding while we are still standing in the jet bridge. We get on the plane and the cleaner would not move to let us put our bags away; mine were still in the FWD doorway blocking the door. I start to preflight without putting bags away and I mentioned to the gate agent; if she could please not board without our permission. The gate agent says in front of the line of passengers 'I'm trying to expedite the boarding process on such a short flight since you guys were late'. Our FO (First Officer) then said; 'you cannot board without our permission we have to make sure our safety procedures are done'. The gate agent mumbled to the passengers who could clearly see we were not ready and were very kind to us. After boarding while waiting for the bag slip the other FA (Flight Attendant) made a comment to the gate agent 'that it wasn't very nice to make a comment like that in front of passengers and if she could ask before boarding?' The response was 'good comment; I may take into consideration' and started laughing and walked away to talk with the other gate agent. She had paged us when we were right in front of her and she was aware of us; and started pushing the lady in the wheel chair right behind us as we entered the jet bridge and asked us if we were ready to board when we hadn't gotten on the plane yet. CRM between gate agents and flight crew requires proper communication and respect by the entire team. I would like to add our crew were all on the same page and our FO was respectfully helping us communicate to the gate agent.,,,,Airline Flight Attendant reported having a gate agent commence passenger boarding before the required preflight safety checks were complete.,"The incident occurred during the final flight of a trip, where the inbound flight was delayed, causing the crew and passengers to wait at the gate. The flight crew was preparing for departure when the gate agent prematurely began boarding passengers before the required preflight safety checks were completed. This led to a situation where the flight attendant's bags were blocking the doorway, delaying the preflight procedures. The flight crew communicated their need to complete safety checks, but the gate agent proceeded with boarding, citing the delay as a reason. The flight crew expressed their concerns, emphasizing the necessity of safety protocols. The gate agent's subsequent actions, including making a comment in front of passengers and displaying unprofessional behavior, further strained the situation. The flight crew remained united, with the First Officer facilitating respectful communication. The incident highlighted the need for improved Crew Resource Management (CRM), stressing the importance of effective communication and mutual respect between flight and ground personnel. The boarding process was delayed, and the incident underscored the necessity for better inter-team communication and respect to prevent future occurrences.",communication issues

He told the passengers that if they wanted to get up and move about the cabin; stretch their legs; use the lavatories; do what they needed to do they could get up. A lot of passengers in the cabin got up out of their seats. Took their luggage out of the overhead bins and used the lavatories. The bins were open the aisle was blocked by bags. I made an announcement to let everyone know they should stay seated if they didn't need to use the lavatories and keep all luggage stowed so when it is time to taxi to the gate [we'll be] ready.Then I called the cockpit and spoke with [the] Captain and told him maybe that wasn't such a good idea. We will need a few minutes to get all passengers seated and make sure the cabin is secure. He said okay. Then 7 minutes later he made an announcement that our gate was open and for everyone to take their seats. We made an announcement for everyone to take their seats. Make sure bags were stowed and setbacks and tray tables were in their upright position. When we were doing our checks the phone chimed.I went to go answer it and when I got to the phone we were already moving. My flying partner told the cockpit we were getting checks done and were almost ready. The Captain's decision and lack of effective CRM resulted in luggage and passengers blocking exits and aisles which would have delayed or prevented an effective evacuation in an emergency.The Captain's decision and lack of CRM also impeded; delayed; and prevented our ability to monitor and ensure a safe cabin during active taxi; a critical phase of flight. The Captain's decision; although fully his; allowed customers to create an environment in direct conflict with FARs; company policy; and established safety practices. The Captain's communication with the crew was condescending; unprofessional; and created a work environment that was unsafe for crew and passengers.,,,,B737-800 Flight Attendant reported being concerned about the safety implications of the Captain's decision to allow passengers in the aisle while they were waiting for a gate.,"The incident occurred on a B737-800 flight when the Captain announced they were landing 10-15 minutes early, allowing passengers to move about the cabin, use the lavatories, and retrieve their luggage. This resulted in blocked aisles and exits due to open overhead bins and loose luggage, creating safety concerns. The flight attendant addressed the issue by asking passengers to remain seated if unnecessary and keep luggage stowed, then informed the Captain of the potential risks. Despite the Captain's agreement, he later instructed passengers to return to their seats, and the attendant continued preparing for taxiing. During this time, the cabin was not properly secured, and the Captain's communication was deemed condescending and unprofessional, contributing to a potentially unsafe environment. The flight attendant expressed concerns about the situation violating safety regulations and company policies. A proposed solution emphasized the need for better CRM and adherence to safety protocols to prevent such incidents.",communication issues

She is incoherent and mumbling.' I told the Lead Flight Attendant that I intended to call Medlink. She then said that we did not need to do that and she would let me know if things got worse. I repeated that I intended to call Medlink and asked her to find out her name; age and if she had taken any drugs or alcohol. I found the appropriate frequency for AIRINC and had them patch me through to dispatch. I then explained our situation to our dispatcher and requested a patch to Medlink. This communication was very broken. We were dropped a few times and dispatch and Medlink had a hard time understanding us. While I was talking to Medlink I called the Lead Flight Attendant back and attempted to get the information and requested she locate a Medlink checklist that past flight attendants have given to me. She said that the lady was now on oxygen and had taken a Motrin and a glass of wine and would be alright and I did not need to contact Medlink. I told her that I was already talking to them and requested the info I had requested earlier. She then stated that there was a language barrier and she could not understand the woman; but she was doing better. I again asked her if she could find out her name and age. The flight attendant then asked if I wanted her to rummage through the passengers belongings. I said no just do the best you can and ask her. She then said that the passenger just wanted to be left alone and was tired. I again asked her to do the best she could and find out the information that Medlink was requesting. She then said 'Here talk to Flight Attendant B' and would not coordinate with me anymore. This flight attendant gave me the seat number and estimated her age. He stated that the passenger was acting like she was really drunk and about to pass out. I asked him if he smelled alcohol on her and he replied no. I relayed this information to Medlink finally. The Medlink Dr. requested that we have the passenger lay on the floor with her feet up.Upon landing I asked our Lead Flight Attendant to debrief our flight with us as I felt that we had a communication breakdown. She said we did have a communication breakdown because she did not want me to call Medlink and I did anyway. I informed her that my calling of Medlink was not her decision to make and that getting the opinion of a trained doctor was the safest course to take as well as relieving us from liability for not seeking out medical help for a sick person. She stated that she has medical training as a flight attendant and that in the future she will not call the pilots until it is a dire emergency and she wanted us to call for help and we will just be out of the loop. I feel this is an unacceptable and dangerous attitude. Medlink is not just for dire emergencies and waiting until someone becomes very sick could have grave consequences for a sick passenger someday.,,,,B737 Captain was informed by the Lead Flight Attendant that a passenger is down in the aft galley; but it is not necessary to contact Medlink at this time. The Captain disagrees and contacts Medlink; which upsets the lead Flight Attendant.,"During the cruise phase, the Captain was informed by the Lead Flight Attendant of a passenger lying in the aft galley, appearing incoherent. The Captain decided to contact Medlink, despite the Lead's advice to wait. This decision led to a communication breakdown due to poor call quality and language barriers, hindering information exchange. Upon landing, the Captain addressed the communication issues, stressing the importance of consulting Medlink for safety and liability reasons. The Lead Flight Attendant responded by stating her medical training and intent to contact pilots only in emergencies, expressing upset over the situation. The Captain deemed this approach unacceptable, highlighting potential dangers. The incident underscores the tension between the Captain's focus on safety and the Lead Flight Attendant's policy on emergency communication.",communication issues

When I returned to the Cockpit to start back to my flight Duties; I was informed from the acting Copilot that they had dealt with an unintentional None Crew Person entry into the Cockpit.  Although shocked; after listening to how it had happened I could see how it might have been able to.  The Flight Attendant misunderstood the FO's request to tell his son that they were passing near Greenland for him to take a look.   When I later went back for a washroom break just prior to the landing at ORD; I also talked with the Flight Attendant about his required procedures with the entry into the Cockpit and the Cockpit Door opening. Also reminded him if he ever felt that a request of that nature is what he heard; he best clarify and to just speak up and ask if that was what was asked of him.  Also knowing his responsibilities and training; to just refuse such a request. Had he just asked to clarify; or refused the request none of this would have happened.,,We were at cruise during the second portion of the scheduled pilot break. The Captain was on his break and myself and the relief FO were in the cockpit. As we were approaching Greenland; I called the forward galley to inform Flight Attendant that the weather ahead was nice with good visibility; since he had asked me earlier if we were going to be able to see Greenland. He asked if he could come up to the cockpit. I told him that would be fine; since this would give me an opportunity to take a lavatory break after he came to the cockpit. He said he would call back when the area was clear and he would be ready. The relief FO then called back to the forward flight attendant station and asked whoever it was that answered the phone if they would inform his son who was riding in the cabin that he look outside his window to see Greenland. Subsequently; the Flight Attendant called to say he was ready and would be at the door. I then went to the door and looked out the door viewing port. It was dark outside the door; but I could see his face as he was close to the door. I didn't see anyone else; as the son was much shorter. I then opened the door and stepped back. At that point; the son had already stepped in and the Flight Attendant was following him into the cockpit. As the door was closing behind them; I recalled our security training which emphasized keeping the door open as short a time as possible (three seconds ideally) and realized the safest thing to do was to close the door and sort it out with the cockpit secure. We then called back to confirm the area was still secure and arranged to have them exit the cockpit as quickly as possible. After discussing the error; it appears to have been a misunderstanding about bringing the boy to the cockpit versus pointing out the view.,,A B767 crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit in flight.,"The incident involved an unintended breach of cockpit security on a B767 flight. During the flight, a crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit due to a misunderstanding. The relief First Officer (FO) requested the Flight Attendant to inform the child to look out for a view of Greenland. The Flight Attendant misinterpreted this as an invitation for the child to enter the cockpit. Consequently, the child entered the cockpit, followed by the Flight Attendant. Upon realizing the oversight, the FO secured the cockpit and ensured the child and Flight Attendant were promptly escorted out. The situation was resolved without further complications. The Captain later addressed the Flight Attendant, emphasizing the importance of adhering to security protocols and clarifying instructions to prevent such incidents in the future. The Flight Attendant was reminded to refuse or clarify ambiguous requests regarding cockpit access to ensure passenger and crew safety.",communication issues

Whatever training or emphasis Inflight puts on this training isn't working. More times than not the flight deck has to interject themselves into the process to make it work. On this flight three of the four Flight Attendants didn't think a call was necessary. The fourth F/A insisted. She ran the call. It was bad from the start. She didn't inform the A F/A that a medical call was being made. Didn't know where the jacks were; communications were atrocious. At one point when we finally were able to get her to understand she needed to talk to the Dr.; she keyed the MIC and talked for two minutes straight telling the story of the event. It only stopped when the flight deck keyed up the MIC and interrupted her and told her to stop talking. She seemed unable to grasp the difference from information the Dr. would need and completely irrelevant information. This was a non-emergency event by all accounts. The passenger was awake; alert; and said he felt fine after a juice and snack. If it had been critical this could have ended much differently. As it was; I instructed another F/A to take over towards the end. Anecdotally the F/As are not adequately trained to use the headset. They aren't adequately trained to understand the basics of radio communication. They don't talk loud enough. They don't understand the basic information the Dr. will want. They overstate the qualifications of Medical Personnel who are helping. In our case we had a ski resort medic. She repeatedly referred to him as 'Dr'. We are going to hurt someone. This was the worst medical call that I have ever witnessed. It was an embarrassment; and if it had been an actual crisis; a lot of time was wasted. We have to do better.,,,,B737-800 Captain reported the flight attendants did not seem to be adequately trained to properly utilize ground medical resources.,"The incident involved a flight attendant initiating a ground medical call that was poorly executed due to inadequate training. The attendant failed to communicate effectively, providing unnecessary details and incorrectly referring to a medical responder as a doctor. The situation was non-emergency, with the passenger recovering quickly, but highlighted significant training gaps. The result was a ineffective communication that wasted time and could have been critical in an emergency. The solution proposed is enhanced training for flight attendants in medical communication and procedures.",communication issues
1349852,Aircraft X,Flight Deck,Air Carrier,First Officer; Pilot Not Flying,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,Party1 Flight Attendant; Party2 Flight Crew,1349852,,,,,,,,,,,,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Security; Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Passenger Misconduct,,Y,Person Flight Attendant,In-flight,General Police / Security Involved,Human Factors,Human Factors,I (First Officer) was pilot monitoring on approach at about 700 feet AGL into LAX on 25L. I could hear through my headset and the flight deck door some sort of commotion that sounded like voices. I thought it was slightly unusual; but we were close to landing; [and] I wasn't sure if the flight attendants were simply doing their last minute duties before landing. On the landing rollout turn onto a high speed taxiway; we got a call from the flight attendants. My Captain and I recognized it and both agreed we were going to address it as soon as we completed our after landing duties since we were still slowing down and in a very high workload environment between the normal flows; checklist; and call to ops. Before we could complete our after landing flows; however; the flight attendants then called using the 'emergency' call button. The Captain immediately stopped the plane and informed ATC while I talked to the flight attendants. The flight attendants told us we had a belligerent passenger; who had taken her seat belt off during approach and was walking around the cabin. I relayed this information to the Captain. We tried to ascertain what the current status of the passenger was to determine if she was still a threat. The flight attendants said she had returned to her seat with her seat belt fastened. Following the Captain's direction; I asked the flight attendant if they thought we needed a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) to meet us at the gate; since the information we were getting appeared to indicate that the passenger had returned to her seat and fastened her seat belt and was complying. After a pause and the flight attendant's clear hesitation on making this decision; I suggested that we'd have a LEO meet us at the gate; which the flight attendants agreed was a good decision. I called ops; and worked through arranging a LEO to meet us at the gate. Unfortunately; in the chaos ops didn't know we were on the ground in LAX because our ACARS had failed midair on that leg. This resulted in some delay getting the ground crew to the gate to marshal us in and then waiting for the LEO to meet us at the gate after we had parked. We delayed deplaning the aircraft until the LEO could escort the passenger off the plane.I saw the passenger briefly in the jet bridge hitting the LEO while the LEO explained to her that she would be arrested [if] she didn't stop. I left to do my walk around; and when I returned; I saw her being carried away in handcuffs by two LEOs up the jet bridge.As the incident occurred we were informed that it was alcohol-related; and the passenger was clearly intoxicated. She had been served two alcoholic beverages during the flight; and according to the flight attendants; was perfectly normal after 1; but the second resulted in her belligerent behavior.Passengers being disruptive are a part of air travel; but there were a few lessons I learned to help make it smoother with less operational disruptions. First; explain to the flight attendants that they should let us know quickly if there's a potential problem. On final approach; one of us could conceivably have answered a call early on knowing there was simply an issue with a passenger. Then we could have called back when we had finished our initial after landing duties and better managed the workload.While the Captain and I performed great CRM during the whole event (clearly dividing who was doing what - Captain did taxiing and communicating with ATC while I talked with the flight attendants and coordinated with ops); things changed when our first form of communication with the flight attendants was after they had pushed the emergency call button. The Captain and I both feared when we saw that light go on that we might have been on fire or some other emergency requiring evacuation onto the taxiway. The Captain later informed the flight attendants that we were going to get to the situation as quickly as it was safe to do so; but the emergency callbutton might not have been necessary since at the time they called the passenger was in her seat with her seat belt fastened.Finally; I believe one of the important things for the flight attendants to learn is how much we pilots rely on them to paint a picture of what is happening in the cabin in a situation like this. Initially when they called up; it sounded like it was a minor issue that was under control and wouldn't require any special assistance; and it took a long time to come to the conclusion to pull the trigger on having security meet us at the gate. When we exited the flight deck at the gate; the Captain and I agreed that there was no doubt we needed security to meet us (and the Captain commented that if she'd been displaying that behavior when she boarded the flight; she would have still been in [departure airport] at the gate); as even though she was in her seat; she still was not complying with instructions and posing a threat to those around her (as evidenced by her repeatedly hitting the calm LEO while in the jet bridge). Having gotten this information better communicated to us would have allowed us to get to the gate quicker since we were stopped on the taxiway during the whole conversation with the flight attendants. While in this incident it did not make a difference; a different situation might result in a passenger being more physically aggressive; making a quick decision allow for a sooner end to the scenario with less damage or injury to passengers and crew. And while not as important; a quicker decision would have also mitigated some of the delay that this incident caused to the remaining flights of the day.,,,,Air Carrier First Officer reported that an unruly passenger disrupted the cabin shortly before landing.,"During a flight approaching Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), a passenger became unruly and disruptive after consuming two alcoholic beverages. The passenger removed her seatbelt during the approach, walked around the cabin, and refused to comply with crew instructions, despite returning to her seat and fastening her seatbelt. The flight attendants initially contacted the flight deck, reporting the situation. When the passenger's behavior continued to escalate, the flight attendants activated the emergency call button, prompting the flight crew to stop the aircraft and coordinate with air traffic control (ATC) and ground operations. The flight crew, with the assistance of law enforcement, delayed deplaning until the passenger could be escorted off the aircraft. The passenger was eventually removed by security after becoming physically aggressive with the law enforcement officer. The incident was attributed to alcohol-related behavior and resulted in delays due to communication challenges, as the aircraft's ACARS system had failed, complicating coordination with ground staff. The flight crew emphasized the importance of clear and timely communication from the flight attendants regarding potential cabin issues. They suggested that earlier notification of the situation could have allowed for better management of workload and a smoother response. Additionally, the flight crew highlighted the need for flight attendants to provide a more detailed account of cabin events to help pilots assess the situation accurately and make informed decisions.",communication issues

None of them spoke English; making communication very difficult. The mother was seated next to one of the boys with the girl and a boy behind her and one boy in front of her. The girl appeared to be the youngest and was about 3 or 4 years old. When we secured the cabin before door closure they were all in their seat belts; but after we closed the MCD (Main Cabin Door) and started the safety pre-departure announcement and demo; the little girl got out of her seat and stood next to her mother. The mother made no effort to get her child back in her seat. We stopped the demo and I managed to get her back in her seat belt and tried to indicate to her brother that she needed to stay there. We finished the demo; secured the cabin and taxied out to the runway. We were in line to take off and were expecting our takeoff chime when the little girl got up again. This time the mother picked her up and put her on her lap. Even though she appeared to be over two years of age; I felt that getting up to rectify the situation at that phase of the flight was not safe as it would take some time to get her settled again and decided to leave the child held on her mother's lap for takeoff. As soon as it was safe for us to get up; I went back to the mother and decided to rearrange the children to try to avoid a repeat incident. I tried to indicate that the little boy sitting next to her should go to the row behind and that she should strap the little girl into the seat next to her. There was very little cooperation from any of them; including the mother; but I finally got the little boy strapped into the seat one row back and the little girl seated next to her mother and in her seat belt. She fell asleep and stayed there for the rest of the flight.There was a big language barrier and complete lack of understanding of airplane safety and regulations. They not only did not speak English; but hardly spoke at all (even to each other). The family boarded last and had been escorted out to the plane; presumably so that they would know where to go. I did not realize until after we closed the door that none of the family spoke English and there was no information on the paperwork. When the little girl got up the first time; during the demo; I alerted the flight deck that we might have a problem with an unsecured child over two years old. When I got her seated; the CA (Captain) said that if she was secured; we were going to go. I thought that I had succeeded in making someone in the family understand that she needed to be in her seat belt and that she wouldn't get up again; so we proceeded to taxi out and get in line for takeoff.,,[Report narrative contained no additional information.],,Air carrier Flight Attendants reported having difficulty getting a non-English speaking family to understand and comply with safety procedures and regulations.,"The incident involved a language barrier and lack of understanding of airplane safety regulations by a non-English speaking family consisting of a mother and four young children (three boys and one girl). During the pre-departure safety demonstration, the youngest child repeatedly left her seat, and the mother failed to ensure compliance with safety protocols. The flight attendant intervened, securing the child initially but facing resistance when attempting to rearrange the seating during takeoff. Due to safety concerns and time constraints, the flight attendant allowed the mother to hold the child during takeoff. Post-takeoff, the flight attendant successfully rearranged the children, securing the youngest girl in her seat. The language barrier and lack of cooperation from the family posed significant challenges, but the flight attendant managed the situation to ensure a safe flight. The proposed solution involved persistent communication and adjustments to seating arrangements to prevent further incidents.",communication issues

Several passengers at mid cabin and aft cabin were non-compliant of takeoff instructions and the D and B FA were addressing the issue. Securing the cabin was taking a little longer than normal due to non-compliant passengers. Pilots signaled the cleared for takeoff ding. The 'A' flight attendant did not answer and confirm with pilots that cabin was secured due to the fact that flight attendants were still addressing non-compliant passengers. 'A' flight attendant observed aircraft taxi onto runway and immediately went into take off phase. 'A' flight attendant immediately made pa announcement to all flight attendants to take their seats and secure themselves. 'A' flight attendant was not able to notify the Captain in time to delay take off due to sterile flight deck. Captain did not ask for verbal confirmation if cabin and flight attendants were secured. When we landed and Captain was informed of what happen; there was no concern or remorse from his part and when asked why did he takeoff without confirming cleared for takeoff signal from the 'A' flight attendant his response was 'I heard talk so I assumed you were secured.' I feel there was a breakdown in communication between pilots and flight attendants.Breakdown in communication occurred between the pilots and flight attendants and needs to be addressed. A more paced taxi should take place to allow flight attendants enough time to secure the cabin; galleys and themselves in jump seats including performing the emergency demo on a very short taxi especially at smaller airports. And finally we should possibly add to the present response we have in place to the pilots [something to the effect of reminding passengers to check your seat belts and that the cabin and flight attendants are secure.],,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported a takeoff before the cabin was secured due to some noncompliant passengers and no communication with the flight crew.,"The incident occurred on a B737 flight during which non-compliant passengers delayed the cabin securing process, as the flight attendants were occupied with addressing their behavior. When the pilots signaled clearance for takeoff, the 'A' flight attendant, unable to confirm with the captain due to a sterile flight deck, initiated takeoff without confirmation. After landing, the captain's assumption that the cabin was secure based on hearing passenger conversation highlighted a communication breakdown. The flight attendant suggested solutions: allowing more taxi time for cabin securing, adding passenger reminders, and enhancing communication between flight crew and attendants to prevent future incidents.",communication issues

As I was contemplating asking if he needed to use his concentrator during all phases of the flight; I checked my manifest and noticed he wasn't even listed as having an O2 concentrator. As I was about to ask him a question or two; the passenger in 13B asked me if his (12B) O2 bottle ran out; would we have O2 bottles for him to use on board. I almost chuckled as I said 'he's not using O2 from a bottle; it's an O2 concentrator; but we have no info about it even being on board.' She replied that he indeed was using an O2 bottle as he has lung cancer and only 25% use of one of his lungs. I must have had a very odd look on my face as I said 'but he can't bring his own O2 bottle on board an aircraft; totally not allowed!' 'How did you get past the TSA?' She said they discovered the bottle; took it; checked it out; and returned it saying it was okay. My comment was 'they what?' 'So; no one else was informed that you had this and intended to use it on the plane? Turn it off please; now.' I went and retrieved one of our Portable Oxygen Bottles (POBs) and asked the D flight attendant to tell the A flight attendant to notify the flight deck. The passenger in 13B was the girlfriend of the passenger in 12B. She also told me he has used his own POB on many other flights before. She didn't say which airline.Being the C flight attendant; I'm not allowed to be forward of the exit rows for boarding; nor would I leave my cabin area of responsibility prior to takeoff. After takeoff; I'm setting up my cart as the B and D flight attendants are [completing other service duties]. So; not sure how I could have done anything different due to my position. Had I been working a position where I would have seen Mr. [12 B] on what I would have assumed was an O2 concentrator; I would have looked at my manifest to see if he was listed as using one. I would have then asked him if he needed to use it during all phases of flight including takeoff and landing; where I may have asked to move him to a window seat so as not to block/hamper other passengers egress to the main aisle in an emergency. That exchange most likely would have brought about a discovery of an O2 bottle and not a concentrator.I think lesson #1 is never assume a darn thing! Many passengers are not aware they need to disclose plans to use an O2 concentrator and I have watched them come onboard only to discover they aren't listed on my manifest. I then have time to contact an agent to see if they are aware of it and it just hasn't showed up on my manifest yet. I strongly suggest all flight attendants be very aware of passengers using O2 and watch for the device when passengers are boarding; then verify we all know about it. None of that would have mattered in this instance as his O2 bottle was concealed in a small black oblong bag. Boarding an aircraft is a crazy busy time for all concerned. All the more reason to be alert then; as well as any time after takeoff; to things like a passengers using (what should only be) an O2 concentrator and checking to make sure they are listed in our manifest or the proper tag has been placed on it by our agents.,,,,Flight Attendant reported discovering a lung cancer patient inhaling oxygen from a personal bottle not listed on the manifest. The bottle was turned off and replaced with an onboard bottle.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a passenger in seat 12B, diagnosed with lung cancer, used a personal oxygen bottle not listed on the manifest. The flight attendant, initially unaware, was informed by the passenger's girlfriend that TSA had permitted the bottle. Upon realizing the bottle's presence, the flight attendant retrieved an onboard portable oxygen bottle, instructed the passenger to turn off his personal device, and notified the cockpit. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of verifying oxygen device usage and being vigilant during boarding to prevent similar occurrences. The result was the passenger switching to the provided onboard bottle.",communication issues

Upon check in; asked the Customer Service (CS) agent if there were any Specials (ie. FAMs; WCHRs; LEOs etc); he replied no. Boarding started with First Class; when a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) presented his paperwork to me in the First Class galley. Since the Pilots had not yet arrived; I got his info; advised him to take a seat and when the First Officers (FO) arrived I would advise. Soon after; one of the First Class passengers that had already boarded motioned me to the galley. Turns out he was a Federal Air Marshal (FAM); he presented and I verified credentials; and he was wanting to know where the LEO was seated. When the FOs boarded; they didn't know about the FAMs and LEO either. When the CS agent came down with the final paperwork; I asked him to the galley (out of passenger view) and told him that we as a crew need to know these in advance. This information was available when we checked in; so why wasn't it given to us then? His reply was; To tell us about these armed passengers would compromise security; and if I really need to know; it's all on the FINAL paperwork.,,,,A B737 Purser reported the gate agent refused to tell her where the Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) and Federal Air Marshal (FAM) were seated on their aircraft because to do so would be a security breach.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Purser) and ground personnel (Customer Service agent) regarding the disclosure of information about a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) and a Federal Air Marshal (FAM) on board a flight.

The Purser sought to verify their credentials and seating locations but was informed by the Customer Service agent that such information could compromise security and was only available on the final paperwork. The Purser expressed frustration over the lack of advance communication, as this information is typically provided upon check-in.

I couldn't imagine starting off a flight any better. I ask my First officers (FO) what their plans were for meal service and then shared this with both Purser and the galley person so as have a plan and to work out reasonable expectations. The Relief Pilot did not want to eat until after the first break. Both the First Officer and I said 'if you have our snacks or cold breakfast we will take that now so as to unburden you until after the passenger meal service is complete. Unfortunately only the hot meals were aboard so we all agreed that 45 minute after takeoff (ATO) our food would be put in the oven to be eaten at XA:15 ATO. This is my typical communication while finding the right balance and compromise to promote a positive working together atmosphere. Forty-five minutes after takeoff; I called and verified the meals were being heated and he said yes. (XA:30 ATO) about forty-five minutes after the meals being heated I needed to use the rest room and thought this was a good time since the meals should have been ready 15 minutes ago. This would also minimize the cockpit door from being opened and also reduce disturbing the passenger service flow. During this door opening the galley person seemed just a little off and spoke almost too quick to understand and said something about our meals and that he put the wrong ones in but that he had them in now and they needed another seven minutes; I said cool; no worries and the door closed.(XB:15 ATO) Another forty-five minutes goes by and we still have no meals.(XB:45 ATO) I called the galley person and asked about the meals and he said 'we would get them when he was finished with his service' with a firm no-option tone.I immediately called the Purser and informed him the situation and we needed to get our food and was looking for assistance and support from him. It was at this time the Purser stated; 'you need to understand; our procedures; our manual and our training is that the customer comes before the pilot.' I used a firmer voice and said; 'I don't care about the passenger service; we need our food'. Basically his response was sorry that's the way it is! I decided to ACARS Dispatch to get the Duty Manager and an In-Flight supervisor in on the situation. Being refused food and not being contacted or checked in on by the Flight Attendants during the flight (not once) seemed unreasonable; but more importantly it was now deliberate and unsafe. I now realized there was a deliberate 'threat' building here by my very own co-workers and that I needed to address it. I asked to have In-Flight re-assign both the Purser and the Galley person to positions in the aft cabin and to send it over the ACARS. I felt this prudent to defuse the situation and get our food and beverages and that we needed a new Purser and Galley person who understood human physiological needs and 'Safety of Flight' issues. My request was denied by In-Flight operations stating they contractually cannot do that. I sent a message to Dispatch and said ok then I told them I would do it and sent them the details. (XC:00 ATO) Attempting to use 'all resources' to effectively manage this situation; I was going back and forth with dispatch on ACARS for 15 minutes trying to resolve a now serious distraction to the safety of our flight. I am now shocked to find out the Purser actually went on his break and was asleep in spite of my repeated requests for us to have food and knowing this was a major issue. When I called to have the Purser come to the cockpit so I could inform him of the crew position changes I was informed he was on his break and asleep. I am not sure which female Flight Attendant answered the phone but she hesitated when I asked to speak with him; in fact she seemed disturbed that I would call and wake him during his break. At this time I gave a direct order to this Flight Attendant to wake him and have him come to the cockpit with no delay. This was done and the Purser came into the cockpit and I informed him that the company is aware of the situation and that [another Flight Attendant] is now the Purser and that I allowed her to select our new galley person. The original Purser was speechless during my entire briefing as I informed him how both he and the galley person's behavior was appalling; disgusting and unsafe. He didn't respond and was expressionless. It didn't seem to bother him one bit.The Assistant Chief Pilot met the flight and was informed of the situation. He was professional and supportive. A Supervisor for the Flight Attendants then arrived. First Officer from my flight was present. We had a quick introduction and went to the first class cabin where all the Flight Attendants were sitting. Both supervisors were introduced and I went ahead and told them exactly what I thought of their behavior and how it negatively affected the flight. I told both the Purser and the galley person their behavior was disgusting; unprofessional and unsafe. I then repeated to the In-Flight Supervisor what the Purser had said to me: 'you need to understand; our procedures; our manual and our training is that the customer comes before the pilot.' I also explained about the three hours of no food in sight and then asked the supervisor to confirm if the above statement was true and his thoughts.In response; and without hesitation; Inflight Supervisor stated unequivocally: 'That's a true statement.'The Assistant Chief Pilot; did not appear happy with that response from the supervisor and jumped in to explain about 'Captain's Authority.' I was so disturbed by the statement that I informed the [Chief Pilot] was leaving because it was pointless to continue this dialogue. At this moment; I realized this is a much bigger issue.,,,,B-757 Captain described an unsatisfactory working relationship with the Purser and the galley person during an oceanic crossing.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight captain and the purser during a flight. The captain aimed to coordinate meal times with the crew and passengers but encountered delays. Despite his efforts to compromise, the purser prioritized passenger service over crew needs, leading to a breakdown in communication. The captain sought assistance from dispatch, requesting reassignment of the purser and galley person, but this was denied. The purser's unresponsiveness during a critical period further frustrated the captain, who then addressed the issue with higher authorities. However, the situation remained unresolved, highlighting a broader issue within the organization. The summary underscores the importance of balancing crew well-being with passenger service and the need for effective support structures.",communication issues

I did my PAX count and handed it to the pilots; just as I was about to head back to the rear of the plane the gate agent stopped me. He then handed me two; what looked like boarding passes and said that I needed to upgrade YYD to ZZD; as she was next on the upgrade list; and also pointed out that the other paper was an interrupted travel itinerary for PAX XXD. He then told me that the PAX in XXD may have had a bit too much to drink earlier so keep an eye on him. I asked the agent if he was going to be an issue and he said that he should be fine but wanted to give us a heads up just in case. I then upgraded the PAX in YYD to ZZD and checked on the PAX in XXD and he appeared to be fine. I had no issue with him and he did not cause a scene or anything else. I then went back the aft galley and called the FA-A and told them to make the CA aware of the situation of the PAX in XXD; but to also let him know that there were no problems and we felt fine taking him with us on the flight. The PAX slept for most of the flight and did not want any snack or beverage during flight. Once we landed the PAX in XXC told FA-A as he was deplaning that the PAX in XXD had urinated in the seat during landing and was wiping the seat down as he left. FA-A told the CA and the CA called for hazmat to come clean the seat. When cleaning/doing seatbelts both I and the other FA did not touch seats XXC/D and also warned the incoming crew.My main concern is not the possibly intoxicated PAX as he was fine there were no issues at all. I'm mainly concerned about how the gate agent handled this situation. He never made the crew or CA aware of this PAX until just before shutting the main cabin door. We as a crew never had a chance to discuss the situation until it was thrown at us right as the Main Cabin Door (MCD) was being closed. These type of situations should be brought to our attention as soon as possible. Again I want to say my main concern is with the gate agent not handling this situation properly.,,,,EMB175 Flight Attendant reported being informed by the Customer Service Representative as the main cabin door is closed; that a passenger they boarded is intoxicated but shouldn't pose a problem. He did not; but the passenger seated next to the possibly intoxicated passenger informed the Flight Attendant during deplaning that the possible intoxicated passenger urinated in his seat during landing.,"An incident occurred on an EMB175 flight involving a flight attendant and ground personnel. The flight attendant completed the passenger count and handed it to the pilots. A gate agent approached them with two boarding passes: one for an upgrade request (YYD) and another for a passenger (XXD) with an interrupted travel itinerary, noting that XXD might have been intoxicated. The flight attendant upgraded YYD and monitored XXD, who appeared fine during the flight. Upon landing, passenger XXC informed the flight attendant that XXD had urinated in the seat during landing. The captain was alerted, and hazmat was called to clean the area. The flight attendants avoided the affected seats and notified the incoming crew. The flight attendant expressed concern about the gate agent's handling of the situation, stating that the crew was only informed just before the cabin door closed, leaving them unprepared. The primary issue was the lack of timely communication from the ground staff. The flight attendant suggested that ground personnel should inform the crew about such situations as soon as possible to ensure preparedness.",communication issues

I was the A Flight Attendant (FA) so I made an all call to the crew to see if they smelled it also. All flight attendants smelled a strange odor. The front smelled like musty socks and the back smelled like parmesan cheese. I called the captain to tell him about the smell and he said they smelled it as well but they were climbing higher and thought it would dissipate. The D-E-H were all sitting in the forward galley with me. We all had headaches and distorted vision. Soon afterwards; I called the back galley to see if the odor dissipated; it didn't and was informed that our one pregnant (F) Flight attendant was being put on Oxygen. I called the captain to tell him that (F) was on oxygen and while I was on the phone I was informed B-C-F were all on Oxygen. I told the captain we didn't feel safe continuing. He said they were turning the plane around. I got up to go check on the FA's in the back and immediately felt light-headed and caught myself on the jumpseat. The E flight attendant told me to sit down and we got the oxygen bottles down and we were sharing the two bottles between the four of us. We were in the air for about 50 mins total. We landed at XA:14. Upon landing no one in inflight met our aircraft. The 'B' FA called crew service center and within 15 minutes inflight showed up to check on us. We told the inflight supervisors that we wanted to have blood tests run for Carbon Monoxide poisoning. They arranged for transportation to see a company doctor. We arrived there at XC:00. The company doctor said that he couldn't do the blood test. We were involved in many company calls through-out this ordeal and taxis were arranged for us to go to the hospital to get the blood test done. I was never seen by the company doctor since the taxis were on their way to take us to the Emergency Room (ER). A Manager showed up and about an hour later the taxis came. We arrived at the Hospital [5 hours after landing]. We saw the gate agent; who met our flight; in the ER waiting room; who didn't feel well; and we were informed also that three of our passengers needed treatment. The ER process was very fast and had blood drawn to check our CO levels. The doctor informed us that we should have been admitted soon after getting off the airplane. The test results will be forwarded to the company. According to Station Maintenance they washed the left engine the night before and were supposed to let it run for 10-20 minutes as procedure dictated; but the proper time wasn't allotted.I suggest during a fume incident that it should be company policy that you go straight to the ER for CO testing.I suggest that maintenance not take shortcuts when it comes to crew & passenger safety.,,We opened the auxiliary kit and put on masks. It was decided that the F needed to go on oxygen immediately as she is 5 months pregnant and we did not know what kind of fumes we were inhaling. Within 10 minutes from the beginning of the smell; we had 2 more bottles of oxygen between the other 3 of us in the back (B; C and G). The G decided not to use oxygen.Upon landing and deplaning we were not met by any manager; supervisor or paramedic. We had to call to ask someone to meet us. We were told by our pilots (who received information from the engineers); that the planes left engine had been cleaned the night before and 'may' not have had the engine run for 10-20 minutes to burn off chemicals; even though that is protocol after engines are cleaned.At this point; I was extremely disoriented; my eyes burned and I had a splitting headache. We all wanted to see a doctor and have our CO levels tested. Shayna began making calls and arranged for [medical] to pick us all up. It took over an hour between getting off the plane and being picked up to be checked out by the company doctor.We found out shortly after arriving at clinic that they would be unable to perform the blood test we needed done. At this point we were trying to get [ground] to take us someplace that could do the test. A Manager showed up and said taxis were on their way. It took about an hour and a half to be shuttled to the hospital.Once at the hospital; we were all admitted extremely quickly. Once I met with the doctor; my blood was drawn and tested for CO levels. The doctor told me it was most likely to come back with normal levels because of how long it had been since our exposure to the toxic fumes and that we should have been tested within a few hours. The test results will be forwarded to the company.There needs to be a very specific protocol for when there is a toxic fume event. We should NOT have been sent to [company medical provider]. They were extremely unprofessional and were unable to perform the test we needed done. Hours were lost spending time there and getting transportation to a location that was able to do the test.,,After takeoff; A330 flight attendants detected a strong chemical odor similar to 'spoiled eggs and vomit' which physiologically affected the crew and passengers.

This odor led to physiological symptoms such as headaches and vision issues among the flight attendants and passengers. The flight was subsequently turned around and returned to the departure airport. Upon landing, the crew experienced delays in receiving medical attention, as the initial medical provider was unable to conduct necessary blood tests promptly. The ground personnel indicated that the odor may have originated from the left engine, which had been cleaned the night before but not run long enough to eliminate fumes, as per protocol. The flight attendant suggested improved protocols for carbon monoxide testing and against maintenance shortcuts, while the ground personnel emphasized the need for specific procedures and criticized the delayed medical response. The medical tests conducted hours later were inconclusive due to the delay.",communication issues

On the first night all three flight attendants were placed on separate floors; causing unsafe hotel conditions. The problem was only fixed the next night after I; as A Flight Attendant; asked that it not happen again. Although the Captain did state during his briefing that safety was most important; he failed to communicate when there was turbulence. I understand that there are times when it comes on unexpectedly but when it did come on he would not switch the seat belt sign on until we called up to have it done; and did not call back to alert or inform us. He also opened the flight deck door to use the restroom without informing the flight attendants so that we could pull out a cart to block off the aisle. There was a pilot jumpseating in the flight deck; but blocking protocol should still have been followed. I quickly pulled a cart out when I saw him and blocked off the aisle as per procedure. During the last flight of the night we were experiencing extremely moderate turbulence; due to the storms on the East Coast; and as A Flight Attendant I determined that it was unsafe for the B and C flight attendants to be out in the aisles at all; let alone with a cart; so the C Flight Attendant called up to the Captain to ask if he could make an announcement that the last water and coffee service of the night would be canceled. When he did he told the passengers to ring their call button if they needed anything. While the flight attendants in the back were still experiencing turbulence the Captain asked for coffee; which is a hot beverage. As the water was shut off in the front galley the only coffee was in the back where they were experiencing the brunt of the turbulence that was already communicated to the pilots. Several landings were more rough than necessary; one caused several passengers in the cabin to scream; while another got aborted by ATC for coming in at the wrong angle. We had to re-ascend and do it over. We also had an on ground delay during the trip; and the Captain failed to update the passengers every 15 minutes as per protocol. When I asked him if there were any updates he was very short with me.It would seem to me that most of these problems could be solved by this pilot communicating better. The conditions of this trip were such that the flight attendants felt as though lines of communication were lacking between the Captain and cabin crew. This creates an unsafe work environment when the cabin crew does not feel comfortable communicating their conditions to the flight deck. On several occasions throughout the trip the flight attendants expressed to me their feelings of un-safeness. If an emergency were to happen we weren't sure that we would be given all the information we would need to properly keep passengers and ourselves safe.,,,,An A320 Lead Flight Attendant reported a Captain's poor communication skills made the crew feel unsafe after he refused to turn the seat belt sign ON during turbulence; disregarded the cabin crew's other requests and then requested hot coffee during turbulence. Poor landings and a go-around also contributed to the sense.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the captain regarding communication and safety protocols during a flight. The flight attendant reported that the captain demonstrated poor communication skills, which led to unsafe conditions for the cabin crew. Specific issues included the captain failing to promptly activate the seatbelt sign during turbulence, disregarding requests from the cabin crew, and requesting hot beverages during turbulent conditions. Additionally, the captain did not follow proper blocking protocols when using the restroom, and several rough landings, including an aborted landing, occurred. The flight attendant also noted that the captain did not provide timely updates to passengers during an on-ground delay, despite protocol requiring updates every 15 minutes. These incidents created a sense of insecurity among the cabin crew, as they felt communication lines were inadequate, potentially compromising safety in an emergency. The flight attendant suggested that improved communication between the captain and cabin crew could address these issues.",communication issues

No inop or deactivated label was present by this CB and no documentation in the logbook could be found regarding this CB so Maintenance was notified. After Maintenance researched the aircraft's history no reason could be found for the CB to be open so the Mechanic closed the CB and signed off the corresponding logbook entry I had written. It is unknown how long this aircraft had been operating with this CB collared.Second; I was informed by the Purser that the aft galley had no electrical power so the utility bus switches were cycled to reset the system and I called a flight attendant in the aft galley to confirm if the galley had power. I was told the power was on and no mention was made of any open CB. I informed the Purser the aft galley power was on. Much later and just prior to departure I was informed that that the forward galley had no electrical power (in spite of the fact the First Officer had requested a cup of coffee some fifteen minutes earlier prior to departing on this all night flight). My experience and intuition dictated an inspection of the forward galley where I immediately discovered two forward galley CBs open. Again Maintenance was notified. The Mechanic informed me that earlier he had opened both the forward and aft galley CBs for reasons I do not fully understand but not related to any aircraft airworthiness or mechanical issue. The Mechanic reset the forward galley CBs and normal galley power was restored.Third; I then needed to confirm the aft galley was powered and if any crew member had reset the aft galley CBs. Power was normal and when asked directly about open CBs a flight attendant admitted that a flight attendant had reset the CBs. I asked him to come forward and we stepped onto the jet bridged where I discretely counseled him that he must never reset a CB and always inform the Captain of any CB that might be found open. The flight soon departed and upon arrival at our destination; as the crew deplaned; I asked three of the flight attendants what they believed should be done if they find a CB open. Their confident consensus was that they could reset the CB one time while on the ground and that notifying the Captain was not required. I informed them of the correct policy but they persisted that their rules allowed them to reset a CB. I further explained the policy was for safety reasons and that I was not authorized to ever reset a CB. I encouraged them to research the issue.It appears many flight attendants may not understand our CB policy and their responsibility to inform the Captain of aircraft discrepancies. Specifically; I recommend an immediate system wide electronic message to all flight attendants reminding them of the CB policy and their responsibility to inform the Captain of all maintenance related issues. Additional periodic training also seems to be required for all flight attendants. Note: On other flights; I have had flight attendants bypass me WHEN I'M PRESENT to inform Maintenance of an issue and only later do I happen to learn of the problem; and have been told by flight attendants pre-departure that: 'you can write it up when we get to our destination' as if they have that authority. Initiative by flight attendants to notify appropriate agencies for support should not be discouraged when the flight crew is not present but they should be reminded that they still have the responsibility to insure the Captain is informed.,,,,A B757-200 Captain utilized the occasion of finding an open and banded Circuit Breaker (CB) during preflight to address what he believes to be diametrically opposed understanding of undirected CB operation between flight crew and cabin staff. He further addressed what he believes to inappropriate direct flight attendant/maintenance interface without prior consultation with the Captain.,"During the pre-flight preparation for a B757-200 flight, the Captain discovered an open Circuit Breaker (CB) with a red collar in the potable water system. No documentation or labels indicated a known issue with the CB, so Maintenance was notified. After researching the aircraft's history, Maintenance found no explanation for the CB being open and closed it, signing off in the logbook. Later, the Captain addressed issues with galley power and discovered two forward galley CBs open. Maintenance explained they had opened and closed the forward and aft galley CBs earlier for unclear reasons, unrelated to airworthiness or mechanical issues. The Captain was concerned about the lack of communication regarding these actions. Upon further investigation, the Captain learned that a flight attendant had reset the aft galley CB without informing the Captain. The Captain discreetly counseled the flight attendant on the proper procedure to report any CB issues. After the flight, the Captain questioned other flight attendants about their understanding of CB policies. Their responses indicated a lack of awareness, as they believed they could reset CBs once without notifying the Captain. The Captain emphasized that flight attendants should always inform the Captain of any CB issues and highlighted the importance of adhering to safety protocols. The Captain recommended implementing a system-wide electronic message to remind all flight attendants of the CB policy and their responsibility to report discrepancies to the Captain. Additionally, periodic training was suggested to reinforce these procedures. The Captain also expressed concern about instances where flight attendants bypassed the Captain to communicate directly with Maintenance, even when the Captain was present.",communication issues

I was the #4 Flight Attendant this flight. At around 500 FT before landing I looked over at the Number 2 Flight Attendant on this flight and we both just stared at each other and then looked outside to see where we were to touching down. I knew we were too high to land and that our landing did not feel normal. The plane started to sink; and we heard the engines being pushed to throttle and we thought the pilot was going to possibly attempt a go-around. We hit the runway incredibly hard bounced up in the air and then I felt the right wing tip way to way close to the ground. I was actually looking outside to see just how close we were to hitting the wing tip and rolling over. At this point the plane was sideways and was squirreling all over the place. I thought we were going to have a crash landing. After we got to the gate at no time did the pilots call back and see if we were ok. The pilots at no time made a P.A. to the people about what had just happened. After the passengers deplaned and we got up to the flight deck; myself and the Number 2 Flight Attendant; we asked the Number 1 Flight Attendant where the flight deck was. Number 1 stated the Captain told her; 'I can't believe I almost crashed this plane and took off outside to look at the plane'. After our 2nd terrifying landing in 2 weeks on another 737; and not being able to talk to our Captain or First Officer; the Numbner 2 and I removed ourselves from our last two legs of our trip. We both were shook up. This was our 2nd unreal and terrible distressing landing in 2 weeks. On both of these incidents the weather did not play a factor. It was sunny and warm. On our flight back to base one of our 737 Captains had just finished his recurrent training. We had both flown many times together without such incidents taking place. He was the only pilot to give us some possible explanations. One; on the earlier incident; the Captain was new to the left seat and needs additional training. Or two it was a max flaps 40 involvement. He explained that some pilots like to practice using the 40 setting; when it really is only supposed to be used on short runways like LGA; DCA; and BOS. At our meeting; the Chief Pilot was initially in the meeting and told my friend and I that; 'this would happen again.' This statement was shocking to us because we have both flown this plane many times without these terrible landings taking place. It should be noted that for many years both Number 2 and I have flown the 737 and every plane this airline has had and never had any landings like these last two.This incident was on our first trip of the month. The earlier event; we had completed a turn I was the Number 4 Flight Attendant; and my friend was the Number 2 Flight Attendant on this flight. This was a really terrifying landing. The Captain came on the P.A. and told us and the passengers that it was 84 degrees and the wind was 5 MPH. He then told us to prepare for landing. My friend and I prepared the cabin and did our final cabin checks and took our jump seats and belted in. We first started to feel our plane did not feel right as we were around approximately 1;000 FT. We looked at each other and looked outside to see how close we were getting to touching down. As we stated to get closer to landing we both knew that everything about this landing did not feel normal; the position of the plane and the attitude. We hit so hard the plane bounced 8 to 9 feet; slammed down again on the runway and we bounced another 5 feet; and then our planes wings tipped so low to the ground; they went right to left and I told my friend to 'cover her eyes.' We both felt the plane was going to crash. After we got to the gate again the pilots never came on to talk to the passengers or to us the crew. By the time the Number 2 and I got up to the flight deck the Captain was gone. My friend spoke to the First Officer; and asked; 'what just happened; what was the landing all about?' The First Officer replied something about the winds; and my friend said no; there was no wind. Then the First Officer told my friend 'that the Captain was fairly new to the left seat'. This was a terrifying landing.,,The event occurred because the pilot lost wind. He was going to do a go-around but decided to land the aircraft because he was lined up. However; we were still too high when he landed and we knew he was making a decision when we heard the engines flare and then we dropped down around 50 feet to the ground.We are the eyes and ears of this operation so everyone says. However; when we have negative issues to discuss most pilots leave us hanging with unresolved answers and emotions. Yes; we are able to feel when things are off with the engines; landings; weather. If the only thing the pilot is worried about is his aircraft and not his crew; we have a long way to go. A pilot that clearly knows that an incident occurred should at the very least call back and make sure that his crew is ok. If he could provide information as to what happened; would be great. Everyone says the back of the B737 feels totally different from the front of the aircraft and it's true.,,Two B737-800 Flight Attendants report a Captain; apparently new to the left seat; lost control of the aircraft in the flare and made a very hard landing which resulted in two bounces before coming to stop.,"The incident involved two hard landings on a B737-800 aircraft, experienced by two flight attendants during separate flights. In both cases, the landings were described as abnormal, with the aircraft feeling unstable and the pilots failing to communicate effectively with the cabin crew or passengers afterward. The first landing occurred during final approach, with the aircraft feeling too high before touchdown. The plane bounced upon impact, with the right wing tip nearly touching the ground, causing concern among the flight attendants about a potential crash. After the incident, the pilots did not address the crew or passengers, leaving the flight attendants unsettled. The second landing was similarly hard, with the aircraft bouncing multiple times and the wings tilting dangerously low. The flight attendants reported that the captain, who was apparently new to the left seat, lost control during the flare. After landing, the captain did not communicate with the crew, and the first officer mentioned the captain's inexperience as a possible contributing factor. Both incidents occurred under clear weather conditions, with no apparent external factors. The flight attendants expressed frustration over the lack of communication from the pilots and the unresolved nature of the incidents. They also noted that the captain may have been practicing with max flaps 40, which is typically reserved for short runways, as a potential factor in the hard landings. The flight attendants removed themselves from their duties following the second incident, citing the traumatic nature of the events and their concern for safety. The chief pilot acknowledged the issue but did not provide a definitive resolution, leaving the flight attendants shaken and uncertain about future flights. The attendants suggested that the captain, who was new to the left seat, may require additional training, particularly regarding the appropriate use of flaps during landing. They also emphasized the need for better communication between pilots and cabin crew in the event of an incident.",communication issues

A few minutes later we received an ACARS message that a new maintenance release was required as well as a status message on the printer advising the aircraft was ready for release. Before having an opportunity to address the maintenance status the lead flight attendant advised she was concerned about the location of an armed passenger and the status of a dog on board and advised another attendant had had a verbal conflict with a gate agent regarding overhead bin space and was asking for our intervention. Finally after dealing with these issues we pushed back and immediately realized we hadn't called maintenance about the unusual maintenance release status. Maintenance attempted to send the release to the printer but were unable. They then sent a truck out with a hard copy passed in through a cockpit window.  We; then; started engines and continued the flight uneventfully.,,[Report narrative contained no pertinent additional information.],,Broken and deferred communications functions of ACARS combined with conflicts between flight attendants and passenger agents created a chaotic pre-departure scene which culminated with the flight crew's failure to obtain a hard copy maintenance release prior to gate departure.,"The incident occurred during the pre-departure phase of a flight, involving the Flight Crew and ground personnel. The Flight Crew encountered issues with the ACARS system, which was deferred, and the inoperative printer. Despite initial normal functionality during setup, they received conflicting messages about a maintenance release and aircraft readiness. Before addressing this, they had to handle concerns from the flight attendants regarding an armed passenger, a dog onboard, and a verbal conflict with a gate agent over overhead bin space. After resolving these issues, the crew pushed back and started engines, only to realize they lacked a maintenance release. Maintenance attempted to send the release digitally but failed, opting instead to deliver a hard copy via the cockpit window. The flight crew proceeded safely with the hard copy. The incident was caused by communication system failures and conflicts, leading to the delayed acquisition of necessary documentation, but the flight continued without further issues.",communication issues

I notified the captain. On the CRJ-700; the main cabin door is the main source of egress in an emergency evacuation.  The configuration of the stairs on the inside of the cabin contain instructions for properly closing and opening the door.  In an emergency where the flight attendant is incapacitated; passengers must open the door.  The stairs on this aircraft were installed incorrectly and the instructions; placards; emergency lights and instructions are in the incorrect place; thereby potentially causing a delay in evacuating the aircraft in the event of an emergency.  Incorrect configuration of the main cabin door. This issue would have caused multiple cancellations and delays; however; I would insist on contacting Maintenance and checking the procedures before completing the flight.,Reporter stated that two of the raised steps on the main cabin door were not reinstalled to their original positions during a C-Check; after the main door had been reconnected to the CRJ-700 aircraft. With the door in the 'open' position; the second raised step from the bottom was swapped with the third step. The second step has a recessed handgrip in the step plate that is used to pull and guide the door during latch handle closing; opening and during emergency exiting. The third raised step from the bottom has placards for exit; door open/close procedures; emergency open procedures; and an emergency light. The steps were out of sequence.Reporter stated the Captain would not call Maintenance or write-up the incorrect step configuration due to lack of company Maintenance at the stations they were flying to. Other flight attendants told her the same condition had also been found on their CRJ-200 series aircraft; but no one was correcting or taking the situation seriously.  Contact was made with a Maintenance Manager who pulled the aircraft from service within three hours after being made aware of the situation. The discrepancy was corrected. Maintenance Manager noted that mechanics and Quality Assurance had missed the incorrect step configuration during reinstallation of the door. Reporter doesn't know if that issue has been addressed.,,,A Flight Attendant reports the steps on the Main Cabin Door of a CRJ-700 aircraft were incorrectly configured during a Maintenance C-Check.

Upon discovering the issue while closing the cabin door, the Flight Attendant informed the captain and insisted on contacting Maintenance and reviewing procedures before the flight could proceed. This action ensured the problem was addressed, preventing potential delays or cancellations.

Flight Crew reported to Maintenance a squeal in the cabin during Deadhead to ZZZ1. Line Maintenance arrived to investigate and requested Flight Crew to start engines with [Main Cabin] door shut. After listening in the cabin at normal pressure levels on the ground; Maintenance put aircraft pressurization system into manual mode and descended the cabin until reaching 3.0 psi and back to unpressurized; approximately 15 minutes. Crew experienced uncomfortable ear pressure but no other medical concerns. Maintenance tightened a connection in Pack-1 and Aircraft returned to service. In ZZZ; the following morning; Captain obtained a copy of the Maintenance procedures including the BOLD WARNING about non-essential personnel not being onboard. This pressurization took the flight crew to a cabin altitude below sea level; there is concern similar to a scuba dive. Pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable. Company Medical was called; but by this time it was 24 hours past the pressurization event. The flight attendant; who has a hearing impairment and wears hearing aids; reported being more plugged up than usual and was removed at Company Medical Doctor's request. The Flight Crew unaware pressurization to 3.0 psi was planned. Line Maintenance did not have copy of procedure with them. Flight Crew unaware of potential hazard due to no briefing from Maintenance personnel and no written copy of maintenance procedure. Ensure that when procedures are communicated from Maintenance Control to Line Maintenance; that warnings are transmitted. Provide written guidance on Flight Crew assisting Maintenance or provide adequate personnel to perform procedure without ANY assistance from Flight Crew.,Reporter stated the air conditioning packs on the EMB-145 are located in the wing root area under the cabin seats. The cabin pressure controller knob is extremely sensitive and controlling a rate of descent of 500 feet per minute is very difficult in the manual mode. The EICAS display indicated the cabin pressure had gone down to 1;500 feet during the ground pressurization leak check. What the actual pressure ended up being; he is not sure; but flying at altitude after that may not have been advisable as he learned later.,Crew was Deadheading in the cabin on an EMB-145 aircraft to ZZZ1 and heard a squeal sound when pilots added power. Upon landing captain informed Maintenance Control. Control contacted ZZZ1 contract mechanic to investigate a squeal sound in the aircraft cabin. Maintenance Control directed crew to start engines while contract mechanic and Maintenance Control investigated the squeal. Contract mechanic was on the phone with Maintenance Control. The mechanics believed the issue was a loose connection in the PACK systems. However; without the flight crew knowing; Maintenance Control directed contract mechanic to conduct an 'air check.'Crew was unaware of this procedure and not briefed prior. Contract mechanic did not have a checklist. Flight Attendant was onboard. Contract mechanic; under the direction of Maintenance Control; and without warning to the crew onboard; pressurized the cabin substantially below sea level using the manual mode pressurization system to achieve a 3.0 psi pressure differential. Crew and contract mechanic experienced uncomfortable ear pressures during the procedure and the procedure was stopped within 15 minutes. Contract mechanic tightened the PACK connections and under the direction of Maintenance Control the contract mechanic signed off his work. Crew did not report any medical conditions preventing the safe operation of the aircraft. Flight operated safely back to base; conducting flight back to ZZZ. This report is being submitted for the operation of two flights; ZZZ-ZZZ1-ZZZ; because the crew were on board an aircraft which was pressurized below sea level prior to these flights. The concern arises from the possibility that pressurizing the aircraft to a pressure below sea level may expose flight crews to injuries similar to those of scuba divers. Captain contacted Maintenance Controller X who stated that this procedure was not dangerous. Captain obtained the 'leak check' procedure from ZZZ Company Maintenance department and found the procedure was not what the crew witnessed. The crew did not have prior knowledge of the Medical Warning found on page one of the procedure. Captain contacted ZZZ Chief Pilot who did not know how to proceed but directed the captain to Company Medical. Captain called Company Medical whose Doctor concluded that further flights would be safe because 12-hours had elapsed from the exposure. However; Flight Attendant; who wears hearing aids was removed by Company Medical Doctor to evaluate ear conditions prior flying again.Crew was not briefed that Maintenance Control had directed contract mechanic to conduct a 'leak check.' Contract mechanic under the authority of Maintenance Control conducted the check without a visual checklist. This is not the first report captain has submitted highlighting the prevalence of Maintenance Control talking contract mechanics through a procedure via telephone. This practice is potentially dangerous especially if the WARNINGS in the procedures are not communicated to those persons inside an aircraft during these procedures. Company should issue written standards to the flight department outlining the approved procedures which would allow pilots and crew to assist contract mechanics with the servicing and maintaining of the aircraft fleet. These verbal procedures are potentially hazardous especially to flight crew because flight crew often operate in extreme environments and with limited time on the ground to acclimate or recover from exposures. Because the FAA relies largely on the science of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) for infection control procedures; then FAA should likely consult hyperbaric medical societies for procedures involving aircraft pressurization and the standards for medical screening of crew and passengers involved in these procedures and involved in inflight rapid depressurization events.,,A Contract Mechanic was directed by Maintenance Control to pressurize the cabin of an EMB-145 aircraft to below sea level in the manual mode. Flight crew and Flight Attendant were not made aware after being requested to start engines with the main cabin door closed. Uncomfortable ear pressure was experienced. Crew departed in the morning; but pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable due to scuba dive effect.,"The incident involved an EMB-145 aircraft operated by a flight crew from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and back. During the deadhead trip, the crew heard a squeal in the cabin and reported it to maintenance. Maintenance requested the crew to start engines with the cabin door closed and proceeded to manually pressurize the cabin to 3.0 psi without informing the crew. This resulted in uncomfortable ear pressure for the crew and the flight attendant, who has a hearing impairment, leading to her removal by a doctor. The root cause was the maintenance team's failure to brief the crew, lack of a checklist, and reliance on verbal procedures. The captain later discovered that the procedure followed wasn't the standard one, and this wasn't the first such incident, highlighting potential dangers of verbal communication in extreme environments. The proposed solutions include establishing written company procedures for maintenance and crew assistance, and consulting medical experts for safer pressurization standards. The outcome emphasized the need for clear communication and standardized procedures to prevent future incidents.",communication issues

The logbook was signed and return to the flight deck. As we exit the acft the flight attendant called us back to the acft and mentioned to us that the ELT lanyard was unfolding. I removed the ELT from behind first class seats. I showed her that one of the water automatic release tape came unfastened. I mentioned to her to have the crew put it in the logbook when they arrived at the acft. I also mentioned to her that I am removing the ELT from the acft for repair and I will be returning with it prior to departure for re-installment to the acft. I went to the stock room at the hangar and to obtain another automatic release tape and res-secured the lanyard to the ELT.

It left early at XA:44. Acft had already departed and the ELT was still in my possession. Flight attendant probably forgot to mention to the crew when they arrived to the acft. She probably became distracted while performing her cabin duties. Have the flight attendant put the discrepancy in her cabin logbook or remove the logbook from the acft. Upon returning to the acft; have the crew put it in the logbook,,,,A Mechanic removed a component from the aircraft to perform a repair. In the process; the Mechanic notified the Flight Attendant to advise the Flight Crew to write it up.

The aircraft had logged maintenance issues that were addressed by the maintenance team, including the Flight Attendant. Upon leaving the aircraft, the Flight Attendant noticed an unfolding ELT lanyard. The Mechanist removed the ELT for repair and instructed the Flight Attendant to inform the crew to log the issue. However, the aircraft departed without the ELT, as the Mechanist returned to find it had left early. The cause was likely a communication breakdown, with the Flight Attendant failing to inform the crew, possibly due to being distracted. The result was a potential safety issue with the missing ELT. The proposed solution was for the Flight Attendant to note the discrepancy in the logbook or remove it.",communication issues

We landed in ZZZ and deplaning took time. We had a full load of passengers and numerous wheelchairs.  Cockpit crew finished their day and left the aircraft.  Flight Attendants waited for the last passenger to deplane and walked out the Jetway with the Ground Agent. I asked the Agent which gate was Flight ABCC.  Agent responded 'Gate XX'.As I look to the right at Gate XX the agents are in the process of pulling tickets and boarding the aircraft.  The captain was behind the podium pulling his paperwork.  As I approached the gate I thought another flight may have still been on the gate. Then I read the signage at Gate XX; Flight ABCC. I asked the pilot if he was working the Flight ABCC.  He answered 'yes'. I told him we were his cabin crew.  Because of our late arrival time from ZZZ1 did they pull another crew to work to ZZZ3?  The captain gave me the crew list and we were still the original working crew. I asked 'Who is on the aircraft boarding the flight? I stated to the agent 'We are the working crew'. 'Who is on the aircraft boarding the flight'?Agent A looked at Agent B and asked 'Didn't you check the crew?  Who is on board the aircraft'?  Agent A sent Agent B down the Jetway to check if there was a crew on board.  Agent A then checked my ID and the rest of the working crew ID's and we proceeded down the Jetway. We passed Agent B in the Jetway and she confirmed there was 'no crew on board'.  This was a 757 aircraft; we were using the L2 door for boarding.I entered the aircraft there were between 10-15 passengers on board. Approximately six (6) passengers in First Class; the catering representative in the First Class galley wanting to check the galley packing; a non-working uniformed pilot was trying to stow his too-fat for the overhead suitcase in the closet; agent gave an unaccompanied child UNACH to Flight Attendant #4 to sign for and bring on board the aircraft; before the cabin crew had a chance to stow our luggage and check out safety equipment.,,,,A B757 flight attendant crew arrived late for their flight because of weather delays and found that the gate agents had begun boarding their flight without them having had the opportunity to do their pre-flight checks. The aircraft was not ready for boarding.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant crew, delayed by 1 hour and 19 minutes due to weather conditions, snow, and de-icing, arrived at the gate to find that boarding had already begun for their flight without them. The ground personnel had started the process of boarding the aircraft, with approximately 10-15 passengers on board, including an unaccompanied child and crew members stowing personal luggage, despite the flight attendants not having completed their pre-flight safety checks. The flight attendants were initially mistaken for another crew due to a miscommunication. After verifying their identities and confirming that no other crew was on board, the original flight attendant crew proceeded to board the aircraft. The situation was resolved when the original crew assumed their duties, but the incident highlighted the importance of proper crew communication and pre-flight preparation to ensure passenger safety.",communication issues

During the course of the discussion we determined that the difference in sound was due to the much colder weather in Airport ZZZ. At that time; tower cleared us for takeoff; which we accepted. We accomplished the takeoff check; took the runway for departure; and climbed out uneventfully. After notifying the flight attendants that we were above 10;000 feet; one of them called to inform us that we had neglected to inform them that we were ready for takeoff; and one of them had to rush back to her seat to get seated on time. We apologized to the flight attendants; then the Captain and I reviewed the events leading up to takeoff and determined that we had forgotten to accomplish the Before Takeoff checklist; resulting in the failure to notify the flight attendants.Threats include the potential for missing an item on the checklist; which happened; and could have resulted in injury to the flight attendants.

Upon climbing through 10;000 feet the flight attendants called to notify of their incomplete SOP.,"The incident involved a CRJ-700 flight crew and a flight attendant. The flight crew was distracted by unusual nose gear sounds during taxi-out, which they later attributed to cold weather conditions at the airport. Due to this distraction, the crew failed to complete the Before Takeoff checklist, resulting in them forgetting to inform the flight attendants of the readiness for takeoff. After climbing through 10,000 feet, the flight attendants notified the crew of the missed procedure, as one attendant had to rush back to her seat. The crew apologized, reviewed the events, and identified the missed checklist as the cause.

We were on an aircraft that does not nor has it ever had life vests under the seats for as long as it has been in the fleet. Because we were in sterile flight deck; I waited until we got above 10;000 feet; made my announcement; helped the B Flight Attendant set up her cart; then called the flight deck to notify them of the issue in the recording with the faulty information. My First Officer (FO) answered and I explained to him the issue with the recording saying we had life vests under the seats when we don't; and this aircraft is not supposed to. I told him that I had this aircraft a week or two ago and had already notified management of this issue; but figured since it obviously didn't get resolved yet that maybe it could get corrected while the plane was on overnight if they could write it up or if they knew of a form I could fill out. I was trying to be proactive about a safety issue. My first officer asked a few questions about it to get an understanding of how this aircraft was not supposed to have that recording and how this aircraft never had life vests under the seats to begin with.  I had some troubles hearing him as his microphone was not that loud/clear and it was very loud in the galley. We did end the conversation with an understanding of what the issue was to my knowledge. I hung up with him; at this point the B Flight Attendant had finished her meal service and was breaking down her cart when the phone rang with the flight deck calling. It was my Captain (CA) this time. At this point the plane had made either a slight descent or they slowed down (I could not tell) then the CA proceeded to tell me that the First Officer (FO) was freaking out saying that I told him that we were supposed to have life vests under the seats and we didn't. The CA then told me that they have been in communication with the company that we were going to divert making a code yellow emergency landing in 10 minutes because the FO was freaking out about us not having life vests. I asked the CA if he was serious; which he replied with 'yes' and then I asked him if we could avoid the diversion; that we did not need life vests and he said 'no.' I told the captain that I never told the FO we were supposed to have life vests; that I told him the opposite. The CA then told me that the FO said I did tell him we were missing life vests under the seats that we were supposed to have. I told him no I didn't; that I thought he understood me; but I could hardly understand him.  The CA then said to me 'oh so you're throwing my partner under the bus now?' I said 'no.' He then proceeded to tell me to stay calm about the code yellow emergency landing; let the B Flight Attendant know; he read off the current time to signify the start of the emergency landing; and to pack up all of stuff for landing. That we would be on the ground in 10 minutes and that I needed to call management right away; because they wanted to talk to me about this.  I said ok. The CA said he was going to make an announcement to the passengers at this time to let them know what was going on. My CA's voice during this conversation was stern and gave zero indication that this was anything but serious. I was freaked out; and started to brief my FA with what was going on.  Within a minute or two the flight deck called back while I was briefing her. It was my CA on the phone; and asked if it was me he was speaking with.  Then when I replied 'yes; it is' he started cracking up laughing and said he was kidding; that we were 37 minutes of from landing at destination.  At this point I was so freaked out about him telling me that we were having an emergency landing and that management wanted to talk to me I don't remember what I responded with. Probably something along the lines of 'not cool.' I told the B Flight Attendant thatI felt like I was about to pass out because I was so worked up. At this point CRM had been broken. After that we continued to put our stuff away and take care of our passengers. We could hear loud laughing and talking from the flight deck the rest of the flight. The pilots ended up blowing a procedure by being distracted by their joke and never gave a PA descent announcement to us or the passengers. We started to get pretty low; so I checked my cellphone app to see how far out we were. At this point we were less than 15 minutes out with no announcement or anything from the flight deck. I made the descent announcement to the passengers and within 2 minutes later the 10;000 foot chime went off. We landed and I did not communicate with my pilots. The only thing my CA said to me as I was packing up my bags was that I had a lot of bags and was high maintenance because of that; with a demeaning tone. The B Flight Attendant heard him say this; and told me 'wow; he's picking on you.' I did not reply as I was upset about them joking around about an emergency landing and management wanting to talk to me about it. CRM had already been broken.,,When I had finished my beverage service and was tearing down my cart when the other Flight Attendant (FA); started briefing me that we were going to divert and do an emergency landing. The flight deck then called interrupting her. After she got off the phone she told me they said they were just joking about the emergency landing. She then explained that it started when she had called the Flight deck to ask them to write up the [safety video]. The flight deck played a joke on her saying that because the [safety video] was inaccurate we must land immediately and that he was going to make an announcement to the passengers and she would need to contact management after we landed. Because of this there was a breakdown of CRM. The pilots behaved inappropriately by joking about an emergency landing.,,Regional jet flight attendants discover that the prerecorded passenger safety briefing incorrectly refers to life vests under the seats. The flight crew is notified of the discrepancy and they turn it into a prank stating they will have to make an emergency diversion. A few minutes later they call back to reveal the prank and that they are continuing to destination.,"The incident occurred on a regional jet during a flight when a Flight Attendant (FA) discovered that the prerecorded passenger safety briefing incorrectly stated that life vests were stored under the seats. The aircraft in question does not have life vests under the seats, as it has never been equipped with them. The FA reported this discrepancy to the flight deck after reaching 10,000 feet, informing the First Officer (FO) and subsequently the Captain (CA) about the issue. The FA also mentioned that she had previously reported this problem to management but had not received a resolution. During the communication, the FO misunderstood the FA's intent and believed she was indicating that the aircraft was missing life vests. This misunderstanding led the FO to inform the CA that an emergency landing was necessary. The CA, unaware of the confusion, prepared for a code yellow emergency landing, informing the passengers and directing the FA to contact management immediately. The FA vehemently denied having suggested that life vests were missing, emphasizing that she had pointed out the safety video's inaccuracy. The situation escalated when the CA called the FA again, revealing that the FO had misrepresented the situation. The CA admitted that the previous communication about the emergency landing was a joke, causing further confusion and distress for the FA. The FA felt targeted and upset, particularly when the CA laughed off the situation and corrected the timeline for landing, leaving the passengers and crew uninformed about the delay. The breakdown in Crew Resource Management (CRM) was further evident when the flight deck failed to provide a proper descent announcement, requiring the FA to inform the passengers herself. Upon landing, the CA made a demeaning comment about the FA's luggage, which was overheard by the other Flight Attendant. The incident resulted in a significant breakdown of CRM, impacting the professionalism and safety of the flight. The FA suggested addressing the faulty safety video as a solution to prevent similar issues in the future.",communication issues

I could feel that we had started our descent.  I had begun normal landing duties (tidying up the galley and general duties).  I did hear the slats come down; however I just thought we were trying to slow down as little.  Next thing I hear is the gear come down.  I had been trying to look out and see how high we were; however I was unable to due to the visibility outside.  As soon as I heard the gear drop I called the flight deck and advised them that the cabin was NO WHERE near secure for landing; as no information was given to the flight attendants.  Also once I called the flight deck; then did the sterile light come on.  I advised them; we had kids standing up; bags out; people out of their seatbelts; and again that the cabin was not secure.  I was asked by the flight deck if we needed to go around; I stated 'YES'.  I was then asked; can you just sit down for landing.  I said UMMMMM yup and hung up the phone!  I made a PA; Flight attendant be seated for landing.  I secured the galley as fast as I could.  And sat in my jump seat; as did the B Flight Attendant.  No final descent announcement was given at all; as there was just not time.  We landed and taxied to the gate with no incident.  After landing; the Captain apologized to me many times.  He stated that they were extremely busy with weather and trying to figure out if we were going to divert to our [alternate].  At the very last minute; the weather improved and they shot the approach and forgot all about us in the back.Flight deck does get busy at times; however they cannot lose sight of what is going on in the back of the aircraft.

Whenever any passenger requested any sort of assistance from medical to a snack we were providing it to them. Flight attendants were making attempt to inform our base supervisor and crew services of the situations taking place on the aircraft. XA:30Pilot informed Lead Flight Attendant (LFA) of diversion to a nearby airport. The landing was going to take place rather fast. At this time LFA informed the other flight attendants of the diversion. Pilot In Command (PIC) made the PA announcement that the flight will be landing in ZZZ due to unable to land at our filed destination due to weather. LFA followed up with a PA announcement indicating the diversion. Also; stated for flight attendants to begin preparing the cabin for arrival. XA:454 chimes - Flight attendants picked up remaining service items and LFA did final compliance walk for landing. XB:02 (Actual)LFA made the arrival announcement.XB:05Aircraft was parked on Tarmac. LFA began Tarmac record. LFA pulled up Tarmac Delay information in [the Ipad]. Passengers begin standing in the aisle stretching legs and standing in line for the 3 lavatories on board. XB:25 [A] Passenger's wife came forward to the galley and stated husband is feeling very nauseous. FA 3 provided his wife with ginger ale; water; trash bag and offered a snack. At this time she refused a snack for him. Then [FA 3] followed passengers to seat to assess.XB:32LFA advised PIC we were in need of our official block out time for delay record. Instead of the block out time PIC informed lead we do not have this time since we are sitting on an active Tarmac. Instead noted and gave the arrival time into the divert airport. XB:42 PIC made announcement we were expecting to depart ZZZ and head to ZZZ1 in about an 1 hour and fifteen minutes. This would give the crew an ETA into our original destination of XC:57. With this ETA given lead then discussed with Flight Deck (FD) the potential for a pour service to be needed. Flight attendants were advised against a pour and snack service to be conducted. XC:00Passengers came forward and stated she was a diabetic and insulin was under the plane. She said she was due for it in about an hour. If we could give her some M&M's and water she would be fine until the delay is completed. Even though this was a medical related issue we did not have to ask for a doctor. Flight deck was notified by LFA. From XB:02 till XC:00 all doors on the aircraft were armed during the tarmac delay! XC:06 The flight deck made an announcement that the aircraft would be taxing to a different fueling area. LFA made prior to aircraft movement announcement minus electronic devices to ensure compliance before saying it was safe to move aircraft. LFA walked the cabin to ensure compliance. FA 2 and 4 were seated in jump seat with aft barrier strap up. FA 2 stated aft cabin secure. A single chime [to] flight deck to signal cabin was ready for movement. Flight deck then called and asked if we were ready for movement. LFA stated to captain 'this is why I single chimed you'.XC:20 Aircraft arrived at fueling area. Captain asked if doors were armed if so they needed to be disarmed because we were about to fuel. LFA made the announcement FA prepare doors for arrival.XC:23 [FA 3] who injured himself earlier on the deicing fluid in the cabin while stowing his baggage before departure FA 2 saw him limping. FA 2 called forward to ask if there was [a] bandage in the First aid kit. LFA looked at the items in our First Aid kit and we did not have [a] bandage. FA 2 came forward to get ice for the customer. XC:27[Another] passenger who had Claustrophobia came forward to the bulk head just looking for space away from other passengers and crew members. Crew members remembered this passenger from the previous week flight. Atthis point we noticed [passenger] very hot; sweaty and in a panic. She was saying can I just get air! She then began vomiting in the trash bag in the galley. LFA made the announcement of do we have any doctors or nurses on board and if so can you ring your FA call button. At this time LFA also notified the flight deck of the situation and we were filling out a cabin report. While the nurse who was chosen by [flight crew] as our medical personnel from mid cabin to come forward. LFA stayed with the passenger ensuring her everything was going to be ok and we were working with the FD for passengers to get off the aircraft.XC:29 PIC headed to aft of the aircraft to do a walk around. PIC asked flight attendants 2 and 4 to hold and watch the tail cone door exit. At this time he went down the steps the FA had deemed to be 'hazardous'.XC:31First Officer (FO) called [FA] into the FD after the cabin report had been given to them. With the cabin report [medical services] was contacted. Once [medical services] was contacted FO gave [FA] his personal cell phone to have the conversation with [medical services]. [Medical services] advised the passenger to begin doing breathing exercises. [Medical services] wanted the use of [oxygen]. [A FA] got the [oxygen] uncovered the mask and the customer felt like it would make her become more claustrophobic. On the cabin report the only medication the passenger stated she had taken was Gravol. At the time I did not know what Gravol was. Passenger said it was motion sickness medicine. When I was writing this report I researched what this drug is. According to [website] Gravol is a new synthetic drug. It is highly addictive and makes users dangerously paranoid; to the point of suicide. It also causes paranoia; kidney failure; hallucination. During the conversation with [medical services] I initiated a crew to crew call with [medical services]. During this short called I asked her to come forward and help with the passenger. [Medical services] at this time stated that the only medicine in our Medical kit which could be administered to the passengers was Benadryl. Passengers refused the Benadryl as well and stated the Gravol should work. Passenger asked if she could sit in a seat in the bulkhead. One of the passengers in [bulkhead seat] heard this comment be made and was willing to move to [passengers] seat. [passenger] thanked the guy in [bulkhead] for doing this for us. [Passenger] calmed down once this decision was made. XC:40 FA 4 stated beverage and snack service as requested was needed for the cabin. Lead had lost track of time during the medicals and everything else; which was taking place in the cabin. Lead notified FD pour service was beginning. XC:41 FA immediately began pour service. We used the plastic bins inside the carts lined them up with cups and started pouring water into them. During this pour service we ran out of water on the carts and crew water. The only water we had left was the water bottles the crew had already drank out of. This service was completed by the 120 minute mark of the delay. XD:19Lead notified Captain we were right at the 3 hour mark of the delay. Passengers even after the service began getting upset. LFA notified flight deck the passengers were beginning to get upset. During the Tarmac delay instead of using the Interphone system to communicate with lead. The flight deck was just opening the door to have communication. LFA ask flight deck if we can go to normal procedures to open the door due how the passengers were being. At this time LFA notified captain that we are getting close to that 3 hour mark of the delay. Asked captain to make another announcement. XD:21Captain advised lead we were about to taxi to gate. FA prepare doors for departure announcement was made. Aircraft was prepared for taxi to the gate. FA did compliance check.XD:27 Announcement was made to prepare doors for arrival. Captain notified FA that the aft stairs would be used for deplaning. FA 2 notified lead the aft stairs were not safe to deplane off of due to the slick liquid (De icing liquid) on the stairs. LFA notified Crew services we did not feel it was safe. They advised us that passengers should take all belongings because there was a chance the plane was going to get Remain Overnight (RON) for the night in the divert airport.XE:30 Captain advised to deplane from the aft stairs even though FA advised against it. As soon as this announcement was made passengers began deplaning prior to LFA finishing her conversation with her supervisor. Once off the phone LFA advised passengers to take all carry on luggage with them down the back stairs of the aircraft and use caution exiting. During the deplaning process [ill passenger's] bag was taken in. LFA asked FD if she could exit aircraft to retrieve her bag. They told LFA to have her contact our supervisor. During the time frame of XE:50 and XG:45[Ill passengers] exited the aircraft not long after the passengers did to deplane. When [medical services] got back onto the plane they stated the passengers are in the terminal area and no one is giving them any updates. They just wanted the pilots or some airline employee to give some updates! XG:45 Began boarding again up the tail cone stairs; which was contaminated with both snow and the deicing fluid. FD asked LFA if we were ok with doing this. After discussion with the crew we decided since they already deplaned off these stairs. It's not safe but [might] as well board and get to our filed destination! Now while boarding the water from snow melting in combination with the deicing fluid made more of the aisle way slick. Just like it was in the departure airport. The flight attendants tried to [mitigate] any risk while boarding and LFA made boarding announcements like normal. While boarding a gentleman near the front of the aircraft stated his name was not on the manifest the gate agent was using. LFA notified flight deck. LFA told the flight deck this could be seen as a security issue. PIC stated a gate agent must tell the flight deck no security issues prior to pushing back. After it appeared boarding was complete FA 2 completed a count when I read the verification announcement. FA's noted we were missing 8 people. This was verified by the gate agent giving FA 2 the names of the individuals to read on the PA. The FA 2 told passengers to ring their FA call buttons if they were on board. FA 4 and 3 re briefed exit rows. PIC handed the paper work through the window of the aircraft to a gate agent. LFA stated 'Cabin Secure!; Clear to Close?' I single chimed FD indicating we were ready for push back. FA 3 asked lead if she was ok with doing the safety demo and she would read the safety demo. I said yes and I did the safety demo in the cabin. After the safety demo I walked down the aisle to ensure compliance again. Once I got back informed passengers we would be dimming the cabin lights for departure and read the deicing announcement. XH:15Finally; we landed in our originally filed destination. Arrival announcement was made and we apologized for the delay. Also; stated use caution when exiting the aircraft and getting carry on luggage out of the over head bins. LFA made the FA prepare doors for arrival announcement was made. LFA did her cabin sweep of any left items and cross checked all doors were not armed.XH:58 Crew called crew services to find out information about ride to hotel; what hotel we are staying in and what our show time is for the next day. Finally got the [hotel] our crew was dead tired. We all just wanted to check in and put our heads on a pillow. The day had used every ounce of energy we had.

I then heard from another Flight Attendant that the boarding door had been closed by the agent before we had all the baggage stored and all overhead bins had been closed. To my best knowledge the agent was in a hurry and closed aircraft door before cabin was ready. The flight attendant in front of aircraft and entrance door is the only one who can deal with the agent because the other flight attendant is in the cabin doing their duties. I had no knowledge that the door had even been closed prematurely. I was closing bins as my duties required.,,Contrary to policy and flight attendant direction; a gate agent closed the cabin door before the cabin was fully prepared.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and a ground personnel supervisor over closing the aircraft door prematurely. The supervisor aimed to close the door 11 minutes before departure, despite the flight attendant's communication that overhead bins were still open and passengers were boarding. The supervisor proceeded to close the door despite the flight attendant's instructions, violating FARs and causing an ongoing issue. The flight attendant highlighted the need for adherence to safety protocols, and the recurring nature of the problem suggests a potential need for improved communication or procedural changes to prevent future occurrences.",communication issues

I stood up and knocked on the door and told the passenger to take her seat we were landing. She said she had to pee and she could 'do what ever she wanted.' I knocked again on the door and asked her if she was smoking in there because I could smell smoke and the smoke alarm was going off so she needed to get out right now! She said that I could not tell her what to do! The cockpit called back to inform us they had a light that said smoke in the lav and we informed him that we had a passenger that refused to go back to her seat. The landing gear was coming down and at this point I told her she better stay in there (if she came out she couldn't get to her seat without endangering the passenger in XXC) The Captain made a PA for the passenger in the lav to return to her seat immediately! She came out; cussing up a storm; and had sprayed something in the lav that she claimed was feminine hygiene spray. I repeated 'were you smoking in there?' She started waving her arms and saying 'she could do whatever the [explitive] she wanted and no one could [explitive] tell her what to do' over and over.Another Flight Attendant got her to sit down with the assistance of the passenger in XXC. I talked to the cockpit and informed them that she was now seated and her seat number. The Captain asked me to check the lav to make sure nothing was on fire and I did. She had sprayed something in there to hide the smell of smoke and it was overpowering! No cigs were found in trash can so I took my seat. There was no reason for her to spray that spray and be so defiant if she wasn't guilty! I smell cigarettes and the smoke alarm was going off. I did not smell her spray until she opened the door! She was 2 steps away from the lav the entire flight and she chose to go to the bathroom after we were seated! Police met the flight and questioned her and never came in to check the lav. This woman interfered with the duties of the flight crew; caused alarms to go off in the cockpit during sterile cockpit; told us we couldn't tell her what the [explitive] to do; and almost caused us to land standing up. She should not be allowed to fly again if she can't follow instructions and is going to carry on the way she did! Unfortunately; I believe the police let her go. They asked us if she did finally sit down; which she did...but that was not the problem; the problem was that she was smoking in lav! That is against FAA regulations; if was not just her not complying with crew member instructions...Unbelievable!,,,,An unruly passenger entered a lavatory on approach; apparently lit a cigarette and eventually set off the smoke alarm. The reporter/Flight Attendant's attempts to extricate the passenger were unsuccessful until the Captain made an announcement demanding she return to her seat. She then left the lav; which reeked with what she claimed was a feminine hygiene product; and excoriated the reporter in vulgar terms. The passenger was detained by airport police.,"The incident occurred during the approach to landing when a passenger entered the lavatory, lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke alarm and message panel. The Flight Attendant requested the passenger return to her seat, but she refused. The Captain addressed the passenger via a public announcement, prompting her to exit the lavatory, where she cursed and claimed to have used feminine hygiene spray. The Flight Attendant discovered the spray but no cigarettes, suggesting the passenger's defiance indicated guilt. The smoke alarm disrupted cockpit communication during a critical phase. The passenger was detained by police but not arrested. The Flight Attendant believes FAA regulations should be enforced against her for smoking in the lavatory and non-compliance.",communication issues

I called the Aft Flight Attendant in the aft galley and asked her if her crew oxygen compartment was sealed as well (it was). I brought the issue to the attention of the Captain and told him about my concerns and that I did not believe the seals should be there. After a brief discussion; he said he would make a call and let me know. A few minutes later; the Captain told me that he spoke to Dispatch and they told him to tell me to look in my [Flight Attendant] Manual; that a list of approved locations for security seals would be in there. I told him I didn't think such a list was in the Flight Attendant Binder and asked him if Dispatch mentioned where in my binder it might be. He just repeated his prior statement of 'look in your Manual'.I did as instructed; but after several minutes of searching was unable to locate the list that the Captain had mentioned. It was clear that I was not going to get an answer from the Captain on this issue and that I was 'chasing my own tail' looking in the Manual (for something that's not in there) so I called the (city) Inflight Office and spoke with a Supervisor. I explained the situation; however he did not know the answer; but said that he would call Maintenance and call me back ASAP. I told the Captain that I was unable to locate the list in my Manual and I had called Inflight and told him what the Supervisor was doing. The Captain then proceeded to 'chew me out' saying that any call to Maintenance had to go through him first and that I should not have done it the way I did it. I explained to him that I had in fact brought the issue to his attention first and that he essentially blew me off by telling me to find the answer myself. He kept telling me in an accusatory tone that I should not have called Maintenance without speaking to him first; I repeatedly told him that I did not call them; I only called my Supervisor for an answer because I wasn't getting one from him. The conversation was going nowhere; he was just accusing me; and I felt the need to defend myself; so I just stated one last time '(city) Inflight is calling Maintenance' and left the flight deck. A short time later; the Inflight Supervisor called me back and told me that after speaking with Maintenance he determined that the crew oxygen compartments should NOT be sealed. With the Supervisor on the phone; I relayed that information to the Captain. The Captain then asked to speak with my Supervisor; so I handed him the phone. They spoke briefly; and then he hung up. The Captain then told me that the seals should not be there. I asked him; 'Is Maintenance going to come out and remove them; or should I remove them?' He told me to remove the seals; so I did and brought the seals back to him. He then told me that the 'list' he was referring to was not in my Flight Attendant Manual; and again chastised me for 'not consulting him before calling Maintenance'. At that point; I just wanted to be done with the situation; I was tired of his accusations; so I just said 'ok' and left. Several minutes after we closed the [main] entry door; the Captain called back and told me to re-open the forward entry door. Maintenance came onboard to write something in the logbook. As a result of this situation the flight was delayed by 16-minutes. Maintenance needs to pay very close attention to where they are putting those security seals; they must follow all procedures; and also use some common sense and good judgment when performing tasks. If anyone should have a clear understanding of why those compartments should not be sealed shut; it would be a mechanic. Also pilots in general; and this pilot specifically; need to trust and listen to the concerns of their flight attendants. Crewmember's safety related concerns should NEVER be blown off like mine were; no matter how busy you might be.,Reporter stated that when he came onboard a large transport aircraft; the forward and aft flight attendant jumpseat overhead oxygen masks compartments were taped over with company security seals. As far as he knows; the aircraft had flown all day with the O2 mask compartments sealed up. But taping over and restricting automatic deployment of flight attendant oxygen mask compartments at the forward and aft jumpseat locations would result in all three flight attendants not having oxygen available to them; especially during a sudden cabin depressurization. He did not believe there would be enough time for any of the flight attendants to get to a Personal Oxygen Bottle (POB).Not only was there a serious potential for all three flight attendants to become incapacitated; but assisting with any passenger emergency or implementing cabin procedures could also be impacted.,,,A Flight Attendant reports having conflict with a Captain over the cabin crew oxygen mask compartments at the forward and aft flight attendant jumpseat positions on their large transport aircraft having been taped over with security seals.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the captain regarding the presence of security seals on the cabin crew oxygen mask compartments above the forward and aft jumpseats. The flight attendant noticed the compartments were sealed and raised concerns with the captain, who initially instructed her to consult the Flight Attendant Manual for a list of approved locations for the seals. After failing to locate the list, the flight attendant contacted the inflight office supervisor, who then reached out to maintenance. The captain became upset, accusing the flight attendant of contacting maintenance without consulting him first. Despite the flight attendant's clarification that she had sought resolution through proper channels, the captain reprimanded her. Following further communication, maintenance confirmed that the compartments should not be sealed, and the flight attendant removed the seals. The captain reiterated his disapproval, and the flight experienced a 16-minute delay. The incident highlighted the need for maintenance to adhere to proper procedures and for the captain to consider flight attendants' safety concerns more carefully.",communication issues

Called Maintenance as the IFE Contractor had put an entry in the logbook as accomplished work card 23-32-00 (ops check system normal). RJAA Maintenance arrived at the gate and I asked him if he could remove the system placard. He called the IFE Technician to the plane who then told me that the system worked but needed further troubleshooting. Logbook items 12; 13; 14 & 16 all addressed parts of the IFE system. Local Maintenance did not clear the IFE placard. Per the MEL 23-10 and NEF 23-33b; I instructed the Purser not to use the IFE system for any of the required passenger safety briefings; or other pre-recorded announcements. After departure; I was made aware that the IFE system was used for the passenger safety demo. Apparently; the Purser decided to use the system after being instructed by me (Captain) not to use this equipment.  AFTER GATE ARRIVAL THE PURSER CAME TO COCKPIT; I DISCUSSED WITH HER THE VIOLATION OF POLICY AND POSSIBLE FAR'S REGARDING USE OF AN AIRCRAFT SYSTEM THAT WAS ON MEL PLACARD; AND THAT THE FINAL AUTHORITY FOR OPERATION OF COMPANY EQUIPMENT RESTS WITH THE CAPTAIN DESIGNATED ON THE FLIGHT RELEASE.  SHE TOLD ME THAT THE MECHANICS; AS THEY LEFT THE AIRCRAFT IN TOKYO; TOLD HER THE SYSTEM WAS FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND TO USE IT.  I POINTED OUT THAT THE CAPTAIN HAS THE LAST SAY REGARDING USE OF EQUIPMENT ON COMPANY AIRCRAFT AND THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE COORDINATED WHAT SHE BELIEVED PROPER USE WITH THE CAPTAIN AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY TOLD HER SPECIFICALLY NOT TO USE THE PRE-RECORDED PORTION OF THE IFE SYSTEM AS IT WAS PLACARDED INOP.,,Captain reviewed the logbook items and spoke to both the Narita Mechanic and two tech reps about the issue. [Captain] then declared that the IFE system would not be used by crew. In the course of the flight; it was discovered that the cabin crew made an attempt to utilize the IFE system which proved unsuccessful. Considering the consequences of an MD-11 accident and other experiences with IFE malfunctions and fires; adherence to Captain's directive needs to trump cabin crew intuition. Additionally; MEL/CDL/NEF guidance concerning placarding is vague and needs to be reduced to plain language with the mutual consent of the company and the FAA. This is the second time I've witnessed a problem involving crews and Maintenance personnel not understanding placarding procedures. This entire situation might've been averted if placarding guidance had clearly stated that an INOP sticker needed to be placed on the ON/OFF switch at the IFE control console.Remind cabin crew of Captain's authority. Simplify guidance for installing INOP stickers for MEL/CDU/NEF items; particularly those in the cabin.,,B777 Captain is informed after the fact that the Purser attempted to use the IFE system for passenger briefing after being advised that it was inoperative on MEL and not to be used.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and the flight attendant regarding the use of an inoperative In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) system on a B777 aircraft. The IFE system was placarded as inoperative (MEL 23-10) and the captain had instructed the purser not to use it for passenger safety briefings or other pre-recorded announcements. Despite this directive, the purser attempted to use the system during the safety briefing, believing it was functional based on communication with maintenance personnel. After the flight, the captain addressed the issue with the purser, emphasizing the captain's authority as the final decision-maker regarding the use of company equipment. The purser argued that maintenance had indicated the system was functional. The captain stressed the importance of adhering to MEL directives and the potential risks associated with using unapproved systems, referencing past incidents involving IFE malfunctions. The incident highlighted a gap in understanding of placarding procedures, with the captain proposing that guidance on MEL/CDL/NEF placarding should be simplified and standardized, particularly for systems in the cabin. Additionally, the captain recommended ensuring cabin crew awareness of the captain's authority and the importance of coordinating with the flight deck before using systems that are placarded inoperative. The B777 captain discovered that the purser had attempted to use the inoperative IFE system for passenger safety briefings despite being explicitly instructed not to do so. The purser believed the system was functional based on communication with maintenance. The captain emphasized the importance of adhering to MEL directives and clarified their authority as the final decision-maker. The incident underscored the need for clearer guidance on placarding procedures and cabin crew coordination with the flight deck.",communication issues

Discussed the light with the Captain and because of the likelihood of a long delay in ZZZ; we elected to come to ZZZ1 and report the light 'On'. In ZZZ1; Maintenance found enough debris that the aircraft was removed from service to flush the oil system and recheck for debris. [Contributors]:1) There is no guidance for the flight crew regarding the chip detector. It is not part of the normal preflight inspection but the light is obvious if 'On'. Without guidance there is confusion as to whether this is something we should check or even be concerned about if it is 'On'. 2) The most common time to find this light 'On'; is during the first flight of the day preflight which is usually at an outstation. Due to the difficulty of getting Maintenance to the Outstation and the likelihood of a lengthy delay; it is difficult to convince myself; much less the Captain; that we should report the problem at the Outstation. This is the second time in the last two months I have delayed reporting the light 'On' to avoid delay at the Outstation. This is the first time out of six previous that required more than a simple cleaning of the detector.

Maintenance at a downline Station found enough debris in chip detector to remove aircraft from service. Pilot noted that unclear guidance on chip detector light and on-time departure pressures were contributors.,"The incident involved a First Officer who reported that the Left-Hand (LH) Chip Detector Light was illuminated during the preflight inspection of their CRJ-200 aircraft. After discussing the issue with the Captain, they decided to divert to ZZZ1 due to concerns about potential delays at the outstation. Upon arrival, Maintenance discovered sufficient debris in the chip detector, leading to the aircraft being removed from service for oil system flushing and reinspection. Contributors to the incident included the lack of clear guidelines for flight crew regarding the chip detector light, which is not part of the standard preflight inspection. The First Officer noted that the light frequently illuminated during the first flight of the day at outstations, and the difficulty of obtaining timely Maintenance support at remote locations compounded the decision to delay reporting. This was the second occurrence in two months, with the first five instances requiring only a simple cleaning of the detector. To prevent future occurrences, the First Officer recommended the establishment of clear guidelines for flight crew actions when the chip detector light is illuminated, aiming to address confusion and reduce the risk of similar incidents.",communication issues

The clearance consisted of 'Taxi to Runway 4R' via Bravo and Juliette. After receiving the clearance; and prior to taxi; I confirmed with the First Officer and verified the taxi clearance with the airport diagram. We started moving straight ahead via Bravo and momentarily stopped on 4L to do our normal safety visual clearance (Left and Right) and then; continued taxi toward Juliette. After reaching Juliette; and turning right; we stopped before crossing Runway 11. When we stopped; we received a call from Ground Control with a possible Pilot deviation; and they also gave us a phone number to contact them. After the call; we received clearance to cross Runway 11 and continue Taxi to 4R. At the end of the runway; on the holding short area; I called the Tower. They informed me that we crossed 4L without clearance.We never had the intention to cross any active runway. However; with the clearance that we received (and verified with the airport diagram); we understood that we were clear to taxi all the way to 4R; including crossing the Runways (4L and 11). Apparently; my First Officer misunderstood the taxi clearance because; usually the normal taxi clearance instructions are 'Taxi Runway 4R via Bravo and hold short Runway 4L.' After that; we usually receive further clearance.  In my opinion; since Juliette Taxiway is at the end of Bravo; and prior to Juliette is Runway 4L; when we received the clearance instructions the way we got them; it became confusing and created an involuntary error. Again; we understood; we were cleared to taxi to Runway 4R; via Bravo and Juliette.,,,,An air carrier crew cleared to LFT Runway 4R taxied all the way to the Runway crossing Runway 4L but stopping prior to Runway 11 because they thought the taxi clearance included crossing intervening runways.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) at Lafayette Airport. The flight attendant reported receiving taxi clearance to Runway 4R via Bravo and Juliette. After confirming the clearance with the first officer and referencing the airport diagram, the crew began taxiing. They momentarily stopped on Runway 4L for safety checks and continued toward Juliette. Upon reaching Juliette and turning right, they stopped before crossing Runway 11 and received a call from Ground Control regarding a possible deviation. Ground Control provided a phone number and later cleared the crew to cross Runway 11 and proceed to Runway 4R. Upon reaching the holding short area, the Tower informed the crew that they had crossed Runway 4L without clearance. The flight attendant stated that the crew had intended to follow the taxi clearance as understood, which they believed included crossing intervening runways. The flight attendant attributed the misunderstanding to the taxi clearance instructions, which they claimed were ambiguous and different from the usual format (""Taxi Runway 4R via Bravo and hold short Runway 4L""). The first officer reportedly misapplied the instructions, leading to the unintended crossing of Runway 4L. The crew ultimately followed the corrected instructions and resolved the situation without further incident.",communication issues

During the 180 degree turn back we received a second chime and got the same verbiage from the flight attendants. 'XXXX; XXXX; we must land immediately.' Soon thereafter I took the control of the airplane and radios and asked the First Officer to get more information from the back. We eventually found out that is was an ill passenger who was having a heart attack and CPR was being administered. I then stated to ATC what type of emergency we had and entered a downwind for the landing runway.The phrase 'XXXX' is mentioned one time in our operations manual. It is a Flight Attendant to Flight Attendant reference only. Simple English; with details; need to be used when describing a situation in the cabin of the airplane. Due to the severity of the ill passenger (heart attack; no pulse; no breathing and CPR being done) the flight attendants were under a lot of stress. They performed very well and I would like to acknowledge they probably saved this mans life! GREAT JOB! However; I feel there needs to be much more awareness of the fact that we are not privy to or trained in some of their references; acronyms etc. My perception of what was maybe a fire or other [question of airworthiness] type of situation; even though for a very short time; is very concerning due to the [lack of specificity] from the flight attendants.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger had a heart attack shortly after takeoff; an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.

The flight crew, unfamiliar with this code, perceived it as a serious situation such as a fire, leading them to declare an emergency and return to the departure airport. Upon landing, it was discovered that the emergency involved a passenger experiencing a heart attack, with flight attendants administering CPR.

Nothing was ever said to me about Air Marshals on the flight. This flight had FAA Inspector on board; who works in the Certificate Management Office. The problem began when the agent started the boarding process without consulting with the flight attendants. Passengers arrived at the airplane; catching the flight attendants off guard. The FAA Inspector actually held the passengers on the jet bridge while the flight attendants scrambled to prepare the airplane. FAA Inspector apparently confronted the ticket agent and; according to the Inspector; the ticket agent copped an attitude. A few minutes later an armed FBI agent appeared at the cockpit door to show me his ID. I had no paper work on the individual and he said the ticket agent had my copy of the paper work. A few minutes later a DEA agent arrived at the airplane; and this time the ticket agent had sent my paper work with the DEA agent. I asked the DEA agent if he was aware of the Air Marshals and the FBI agent that were also on the flight; and he said he knew about the FBI agent; but not the Air Marshals. I immediately called for a supervisor to come to the plane. I explained the situation to the supervisor and he apologized for the mix up and said he would take care of the issue. A few minutes later another ticket agent came into the cockpit and I asked if the LEOs had met the Air Marshals. He said there were no Air Marshals on board. Then the original ticket agent came to the cockpit and I asked him if there were any Air Marshals on board. He said 'no'. One of the ticket agents went back to the gate counter and returned to the airplane a few minutes later and told me there were indeed two Air Marshals on board. Knowing that the two LEO's did not know of the Air Marshals; I instructed the ticket agent to inform all four armed individuals of each other. (Which he did).

He said that this would be a normal landing and I rephrased it as a question 'we should prepare the cabin for a normal landing?' and his answer was; 'Yes.' The call ended shortly after. The airplane began to descend shortly after an announcement to the passengers from the pilots. The landing gear was extended much earlier than usual before landing. Upon landing a number of fire personnel met the aircraft off the runway. Although emergency fire personnel were in the jet bridge; the passengers deplaned normally. Shortly after landing the pilots went below the aircraft to inspect something under the wing. [Since I was] not being given much information; I discussed the event with the fire and Maintenance personnel. The issue they described was much more severe in nature than I was told on the aircraft. According to Maintenance the light/message that came on indicated the possible loss of critical aircraft systems and could have been catastrophic if failure did occur on landing. This incident indicated serious problems on the aircraft that sounded; to me; like an emergency; i.e. 'Any event in which the safe operation of the flight is in doubt.' When the pilots returned from inspecting the aircraft I asked; 'What were you looking at?' The Captain replied; 'Nothing.' There was no official debriefing after the event by the Captain. The First Officer did try to inform us about what occurred; but the Captain seemed to be keeping him from speaking with us. After the event the pilots had a couple of extensive private conversations in the back of the aircraft when the only other people onboard were the other Flight Attendant and me. The failure here on the part of the Captain is addressed in our Flight Attendant Manual (FAM). 'The PIC will ensure the flight attendants are advised as to the extent of the emergency or irregular operation.' None of the SOP briefing items were discussed and they should have been as this was; at the very least; an abnormal situation. The time between the Captain's call to me and our landing would have been more than sufficient to prepare the cabin for an abnormal landing. As stated in our manual; 'In an emergency; flight attendants are responsible for ensuring the safety of the passengers and preserving the integrity of the cabin.' With the information provided and the attitude of the Captain appearing to discourage communication; I did not feel I could do so. There was a critical failure of the communication process between crew members of this event. There was a lack of CRM during this abnormal/emergency situation. Throughout the whole beginning of the trip the Captain acted like it was a large strain to communicate with us and that attitude extended into this emergency situation in the air. The cabin crew and passengers were given identical sets of information over the PA and even the experienced fliers onboard knew something was not right. I had quite a few people ask me directly; 'We could tell the pilot was lying; what really happened?' and my honest answer was that I was not given any other information.,,,,A Flight Attendant aboard an ERJ-170 reported the Captain failed to properly brief and prepare the aircraft for what the reporter later determined had been a possibly serious anomaly for which the flight diverted to a nearby airport where they were met by CFR and maintenance personnel.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant aboard an ERJ-170 who reported that the Captain failed to properly brief and prepare the cabin crew for an emergency situation. The flight was diverted to a nearby airport due to a message alert indicating a potential loss of critical aircraft systems, which could have been catastrophic. Despite the severity of the situation, the Captain provided insufficient information to the cabin crew, did not follow standard operating procedures (SOP) for emergencies, and appeared to discourage communication with the flight attendants. This led to a breakdown in communication and a lack of Crew Resource Management (CRM) during the abnormal situation. After landing, maintenance personnel revealed that the issue was more severe than initially communicated. The Captain's failure to debrief the cabin crew and the First Officer's apparent restraint from sharing information further exacerbated the situation. The Flight Attendant noted that the lack of transparency and poor communication strained the crew's ability to ensure passenger safety and maintain cabin integrity.",communication issues

He calls and Crew Scheduling tells him they want the other Flight Attendant. I am at the flight deck door ready to close [it] and the Captain tells me to call Crew Scheduling; and now Flight Attendant B is behind me saying to call Crew Scheduling. I say what for I am not on reserve. I also say; how can I do that we are ready to leave the main cabin door is closed. The Captain states it is OK we are now on maintenance. I changed positions with B and retrieve my phone and turn it on even though the entire cabin has their phones off. Crew Scheduling stated there had been a change to my scheduling. I tell them that I am not on reserve. They say they know that. I tell them I won't do it. We continue to talk and then I ask for the Supervisor of Crew Scheduling. The Supervisor tells me tells me there is no one else; I am within duty regulations at that I need to do this. I tell her we are on maintenance and to get a reserve out there as we are now waiting for Maintenance to arrive and take the flight. I request to speak to a Duty Officer. The Duty Officer is unable to speak with me as now we are leaving. I listen to the Duty Officer message after landing asking me please; to save the flight for these people. There is a huge lack of communication. Upon arrival there is an injured Flight Attendant in a wheelchair. Against my own better judgment I do the flight. We landed after midnight. During the flight I truly realize that I am not safe to do the flight. I am exhausted over the turbulence and sleep deprivation. Flight Attendant B who was in the previous turbulence that downed the aircraft states that her neck is stiff and that she probably should not have flown the flight either. I felt pushed by the Company to take one for the team knowing it was not a safe situation for me.,,,,A Q400 Flight Attendant felt forced to work an additional flight after her normal sequence because of another flight attendant's injury but realized later that she was fatigued to the point of not being safe.,"A Q400 flight attendant was pressured by the airline to work an additional flight after her normal sequence concluded due to another flight attendant's injury. Despite expressing exhaustion and fatigue, including concerns about safety during turbulence and sleep deprivation, the attendant felt compelled to fulfill the duty, citing a lack of communication and support from the company. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and support systems to ensure crew safety and prevent similar situations in the future.",communication issues

Normal departure out of TEB [and] at 1;000 FT AGL engaged the autopilot. Autopilot flew the SID properly [and] leveled off 1;500 FT on a 240 degree heading. Autopilot turned aircraft towards 280 degree heading; but failed to stop and continued another 20-30 degrees. I disconnected autopilot immediately to turn back to 280 degree heading. At the same time ATC instructed us to expedite climb to 6;000 FT. My First Officer answered the call and I began to climb. In the same transmission ATC also instructed us to turn right direct to BREZY. My First Officer responded to that and directed the FMS to take us to BREZY. As we made the turn and climb; ATC questioned us as to where we were going and [told us] that we should be on a 280 degree heading. I immediately turned back to 280 degrees. My First Officer responded; 'You gave us direct to BREZY.' ATC responded that he was sorry he missed the incorrect read back and not to worry; it was his mistake. He said he had asked us to expedite the climb and to 'expect a right turn direct BREZY.' A contributing factor to the miscommunication was the busyness of the frequency workload on the Controller; the aural warning of the autopilot disconnect causing additional noise in the headset for my First Officer; as well as the FMS and autopilot incorrectly flying the SID. A corrective action would be for ATC not to accept an incorrect read back in such a crucial phase of flight. I will [also] hand fly the SID form now on. Discouraging as it is; I will not trust the approved FMS and autopilot to actually fly the SID. Had this situation not occurred at this inopportune time; both my First Officer and I would have taken a moment to question the instructions given.,,,,PC12 Captain experiences an autopilot malfunction during the TEB 6 departure; resulting in a track deviation. A second deviation occurs when the crew is told to expect direct BREZY and reads back cleared direct BREZY.,"The incident involved an autopilot malfunction during the departure of a PC12 aircraft from TEB, leading to a track deviation. The autopilot failed to stop at the correct heading, prompting the captain to disconnect it. Subsequently, the crew received ATC instructions to expedite climb and turn right direct to BREZY. However, the crew incorrectly read back the instructions as ""cleared direct to BREZY,"" which ATC later acknowledged was their mistake due to workload and miscommunication. Contributing factors included the controller's busy frequency, the autopilot's aural warning causing headset noise, and the FMS and autopilot's incorrect handling of the SID. As a result, the captain decided to hand-fly the SID in the future, distrusting the FMS and autopilot. ATC was advised to avoid accepting incorrect readbacks during critical phases of flight.",communication issues

This clearance was acknowledged by both pilots. As we approached this hold short point we were finishing up the PA and the Flight Attendant called. She indicated that we needed a wheelchair at our destination. The conversation seemed to be slightly longer than normal and so when the First Officer returned to the radio the Captain inquired if there was something wrong. During relaying this information to the Captain; the flight crew missed the hold short of L3. Air Traffic Control inquired about this and immediately issued a clearance to continue on Mike to hold short of 9L at M2. The Flight Attendant call was a distraction as well as fatigue in this instance.,,,,An air carrier Flight Attendant called the cockpit during taxi for takeoff requesting a passenger wheel chair at the destination; but the distraction plus fatigue caused a taxi deviation.,"An air carrier flight attendant called the cockpit during taxi for takeoff, requesting a wheelchair at the destination. This call, combined with crew fatigue, distracted the flight crew. As a result, the crew missed an ATC instruction to hold short of L3, leading to a minor taxi deviation. Air Traffic Control promptly corrected the situation, preventing any serious incident. The deviation was minor and corrected without incident.

We were all in our jump seats and had been anticipating landing when I noticed that we appeared to be circling. We were still at considerable altitude; higher than normal for that phase of flight. Knowing we were in 'sterile cockpit' I just waited; thinking to myself there must be a lot of traffic this time of night because if there were any problems the Captain would let us know.Just then; the 'all-call' came over the PA. I answered and identified myself. The Captain answered and said; 'We have a problem with our flaps not deploying the usual way so we have to get them down another way that just takes some time. I guess you could call this a simple 'heads up' because I anticipate a completely normal landing and there is nothing to worry about.' I said; 'Okay; thank you;' and then confirmed my crew had heard our exchange.We landed without incident; although CFR was at the ready down the runway. Upon deplaning; some passengers were curious as to why it took so long to land. I stated it was just traffic. I did not feel there was any need to alarm these passengers in any way when all was okay. There was only one passenger who challenged me by stating that he saw the fire equipment and that the flaps were still completely down even at the gate; so it wasn't just traffic.After landing and debriefing with my crew I explained what I thought had occurred and confirmed with the two flight attendants at door 4 that they both had said 'yes' when I asked if they heard the information. Unfortunately; we did not identify which doors had heard the info. I think in an effort to proctor excellent communication with all crew members when a situation that involves all crew members needing to be informed; that a new procedure [be implemented] to acknowledge receipt of the information door by door. That way if the Purser does not hear confirmation from all exits; he/she knows to relay the information to anyone who did not pick up the interphone.Upon turning on my phone on the way to the parking lot I listened to a very concerned message from a Supervisor who knew of the situation and wanted to be certain that the crew was okay. I returned her call and assured her that there was nothing out of the ordinary on landing. The Captain did not advise us to brief the cabin; it was merely a 'heads up' for the Flight Attendants and we landed without incident.,,,,Incomplete dissemination of information regarding a flap extension problem; which delayed the landing of a B757-200; left some passengers concerned; and some Flight Attendants uninformed.,"The incident involved a flap deployment issue on a B757-200 flight, which led to a delayed landing. The captain informed the flight attendants of the problem via the public address system, describing it as a minor issue that would not affect the landing. The flight attendant relayed the information to her crew and ensured they were prepared for landing. However, the delay caused some passengers to notice fire equipment on the ground, leading to questions about the situation. One passenger raised concerns about the flaps not being down, suggesting the delay was not due to traffic. After landing, the flight attendant debriefed her crew and realized that not all crew members may have received the initial communication. To address this, she proposed implementing a new procedure requiring each crew member to acknowledge receipt of information door by door, ensuring everyone is informed in similar situations. The incident concluded safely with no further issues, and the captain and crew confirmed that the landing was uneventful.",communication issues

The flight time was 38 minutes. The Purser was helping in the back and asked if we heard the double chimes. All four of the coach flight attendants did not hear it. I told her to go ahead and make the arrival announcement but she said that she did not feel comfortable doing so with the seatbelt sign not on.Later the Captain made the seatbelt sign announcement and illuminated the seatbelt sign. I checked seatbelts and returned to the galley and my jumpseat. We were over the water then. Later still the Purser made the arrival announcement. We made our safety checks. I was locking door three lavatories and I looked outside to see the runway. I saw jumpseat at 3R was vacant but did not want to sit in someone else's jumpseat if they could make it back to it. I landed in the aisle standing up between doors three and four. There were at least 3 other flight attendants standing on arrival as well. As soon as the airplane slowed I made it back to my jumpseat and strapped in. The Purser and the Captain were well aware of what happened. The Purser said that she wished that she listened to her gut instinct and made the arrival announcement when she heard the double chime or called the cockpit to see if they did in fact ring the double chime since the rest of us did not hear it. We would like to still have the 'flight attendant prepare for landing' announcement which we are so used to. We do need to have the arrival announcement made earlier. It would be great if the double chimes and the seat belt sign would go off together and we could do the arrival and safety checks then. We need to be more aware of this issue to not have it repeated in the future.,,,,A breakdown in communication between the flight and cabin crews as well as amongst the flight attendants themselves resulted in several flight attendants still standing and performing safety duties at touchdown.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between the flight and cabin crews during the final stages of a short-haul flight. The Purser, who was assisting in the back, initially heard double chimes signaling the need for seatbelt preparation but did not feel comfortable making the announcement without confirmation from the cockpit. Despite the Captain later illuminating the seatbelt sign and making an announcement, several flight attendants, including the Purser, were still standing and performing safety duties upon touchdown. This occurred despite the Purser expressing regret for not acting earlier and suggesting that the ""flight attendant prepare for landing"" announcement be made earlier, ideally in sync with the double chimes and seatbelt sign activation. The incident highlighted the need for clearer communication protocols and improved awareness among the cabin crew to prevent similar occurrences in the future.",communication issues

I advised Commercial radio and a discrete HF frequency was arranged and the patch was made. An on board ER nurse attended the passenger; made evaluations; provided treatment; and talked directly to Medlink. Medlink advised that we could continue and to provide O2 as needed. The Flight Attendant advised that they were using the Therapeutic O2 bottle. The Flight Attendant later advised us when the therapeutic bottle reached 250 PSI and a decompression bottle was used. As we still had several hours of flying; we discussed O2 use; and operational restrictions regarding depletion of O2 bottles. The First Officer and I discussed that the safest course of action; regardless of O2 quantities; would be to remain at altitude. I advised the First Officer that I was exercising Captains Emergency Authority in the event any of those bottles went below the prescribed volumes in order to remain at altitude. I discussed an O2 use plan with the Flight Attendant. We discussed using one decompression bottle to 1;500 PSI; then switch to the other decompression bottle; and use it until depleted. Shortly afterwards; she advised me that the first decompression bottle was at 1;250 PSI. I told her to switch to decompression bottle two; use it to 1;500 PSI; then use decompression bottle one; and deplete it. My thought was to ensure the Flight Attendant's maintained full capabilities in their mobility bottles. Shortly after this discussion; the  Flight Attendant advised that they could use their mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. With this information we revised our plan to include the mobility bottles as long as they ensured the mobility bottles did not go below 1;000 PSI. ACARS messages were sent to Dispatch advising them of the O2 usage and the volume levels of the bottles. After the second decompression bottle was used to 1;500 PSI; two mobility bottles were depleted to 1;000 PSI and a third was being used as we began our descent. Upon landing we were met by medics and the passenger was transported to medical facilities. Once we were deplaned I discussed O2 bottle usage with the Flight Attendants to ensure I fully understood the amount used. I discovered that the therapeutic bottle was depleted to 250 PSI; the number one decompression bottle to 250 PSI; number two to 1;500 PSI; and two mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. Mechanics boarded the aircraft; were advised and we discussed the write ups of the bottles as well as the EMK. [We were in a] high workload environment in ETOPS airspace. Medlink event happened near a waypoint with need to arrange for Medlink; plot; and report waypoints; monitor Medlink transmissions via HF; and derive an O2 use plan with Flight Attendant's that would be sufficient for a number of hours. There appeared to be confusion between the naming conventions of each type of bottle and the amount we could use before encountering altitude restrictions. I thought that the Flight Attendant was trading the names of the therapeutic bottle and the decompression bottle. Once on the ground I discovered that both the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle were depleted to 250 PSI.,,,,An  Air Carrier flight crew depleted their cabin oxygen bottles below acceptable limits while treating a passenger who became ill near the ETP. There was confusion with naming conventions of the bottles and operational restrictions.,"The incident involved a flight crew and a flight attendant responding to a passenger illness requiring medical attention during a flight in ETOPS airspace. The flight attendant initially requested Medlink assistance, and the crew arranged for a discrete HF frequency to facilitate communication. An onboard emergency room nurse evaluated the passenger, and Medlink advised continuing the flight while providing oxygen as needed. The flight attendant used a therapeutic oxygen bottle, later switching to decompression bottles and mobility bottles as the flight progressed. Despite efforts to manage oxygen levels, confusion arose regarding the naming conventions and operational restrictions of the oxygen bottles. As a result, some bottles were depleted below prescribed limits. Upon landing, the crew reviewed the oxygen usage and discovered discrepancies in the bottle levels, including the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle being depleted to 250 PSI. Mechanics were boarded to address the oxygen bottle write-ups and ensure compliance with safety standards. Post-incident, the crew discussed the oxygen bottle usage to clarify naming conventions and prevent future operational issues.",communication issues

I immediately called the flight crew to inform them that all the power in the galley went out and the overhead lights flickered in the entire cabin. They informed me that they had a problem with a generator and were about to diagnose the problem. The same problem repeated a few more times as we lost galley power and lights in the cabin. Later the cockpit informed the Purser that it was safe to continue the trip. I was concerned that we were over land and that I did not feel comfortable flying across the Atlantic with one broken generator. Another Flight Attendant called the cockpit to ask them how safe it was to continue. The cockpit was evasive and never said whether it was safe or not. It led us to think that continuing to fly over the Atlantic and gambling with our lives on this issue was not being cautious enough; especially since we were still over land at the time of the generator problem.Later; another Flight Attendant informed me that the pilots told him that we have seven of these generators and that only one failed. Nevertheless; it did not put me at ease to think that we were going to fly over the ocean even after raising concerns about the dangerous goods on board. Was the airplane safe enough to continue its voyage? It is not for me to say as I have no control over the issue but it sure raised concern as to problems that can be resolved over land and not while over the ocean. Failed generators should not be taken lightly when planning to fly over the Atlantic.,,,,After one generator failed shortly after takeoff; the flight attendants aboard a B777-200 headed for an Atlantic crossing failed to have their concerns about the safety of continuing the flight properly addressed by the flight crew.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding the safety of continuing a transatlantic flight after a generator failure. Shortly after takeoff, the flight attendant reported multiple instances of generator power loss, including flickering cabin lights and a loss of galley power. The flight crew diagnosed the issue but provided unclear reassurances about the safety of continuing the flight, particularly since the problem occurred while still over land. The flight attendant expressed concerns about the risks of crossing the Atlantic with a failed generator and questioned whether the aircraft was sufficiently safe. Despite the pilots' assurance that only one of seven generators had failed, the flight attendant remained uneasy, highlighting the risks of unresolved issues over water. The incident raised concerns about the adequacy of communication and safety assessments during critical flight phases. No specific solution was proposed in the context, but the need for clearer communication and reassessment of safety concerns was implied.",communication issues

I proceeded to get up and disarm the slide and remove the red strap across the window. I then turned on the POS to transmit and unlocked the lavatories. I left the galley and stood by the aft lavatories and watched the deplaning process. A few passengers came back to use the restroom. Deplaning was a slow process.When there were only a few passengers left another Flight Attendant suggested we check to make sure the slides were disarmed. I was not expecting anything to be wrong. She then turned and said that my slide was still armed but my red strap was undone. I was in total disbelief! I could not believe that when I bent down to disarm the slide that I did not. I have never removed the red strap prior to disarming the door. I have always been extremely careful in following procedures. I cannot explain why the slide was not disarmed. I can see myself bending down and disarming the door. There were no emergencies or passengers asking for things or anything to disrupt my routine. However; when I proceeded back to disarm the door the second time; I did notice that the hooks that the slide sits in when disarmed were loose. The bar was more or less just sitting in the hooks rather than needing to be pressed down. So now I wonder if I put the bar in the hooks but did not make certain they were in there securely and they slipped out. My error is that I did not double and triple check the disarmed door to make sure the bar stayed in the hooks and would not fall out. Another factor may have been that I was tired and ready to get off the airplane. What I learned in this situation was to just step back and review all of the procedures each and every time I am disarming/arming a door. Maybe it has become such a habit that I need to make sure I am absolutely aware of what I am doing at all times.,,,,A B737-900 Flight Attendant failed to properly disarm her emergency exit.

After completing routine procedures, including disarming the slide and removing the red strap, the lead attendant monitored the deplaning process. However, an alert colleague noticed the slide was still armed, prompting the lead attendant to re-examine her actions. Upon revisiting, she discovered the slide's hooks were loose, causing the bar to slip out. Reflecting on the oversight, the lead attendant attributed the error to not thoroughly securing the bar and possible fatigue.

This was a completely full flight; with 2 jumpseat riders in the cabin and 1 in the cockpit.  Shortly after takeoff; the aircraft leveled off.  I noticed that it seemed too early to level off and thought we would continue the climb out momentarily.  Instead; the aircraft started to turn.  I was still in my jumpseat; as we were under 10;000 FT. Neither I nor the jumpseat rider next to me ever heard; felt; or smelled anything different with the aircraft.  After a few minutes; the Captain made a PA to the passengers that we blew a tire on takeoff and we would have to circle to burn off fuel so we could return and land.  After his PA to the passengers; the Captain called back to the Flight Attendants to tell us we blew a tire; we had 30 minutes before landing; do not go through the emergency procedure checklist; and he did not anticipate evacuating but if we did the signal would be our standard.  While the aircraft was circling; we flight attendants did frequent walk throughs to make sure everyone had all bags stowed; electronic devices off; seatbelts fastened; and tray tables and seatbacks up.  Otherwise; we stayed strapped into our jumpseats.  30 minutes came and went with no other communication from the cockpit at all.  I call the cockpit to ask when we were going to land.  I was told it would be about 15 more minutes.  When I sit on the #1 Flight Attendant jumpseat; I cannot see out the windows.  I started to get worried because the Captain was so uncommunicative; I was afraid we would touch down and crash without even knowing we were about to land!  I called the Captain and told him to let us know when we were about to touch down so we could be prepared.  Right before we touched down; he called us and told us we were about to land and it was going to be rough.  I am not sure the exact verbiage; but the #4 Flight Attendant asked if we had one or two tires on the nosegear and the Captain made a flippant; curt reply to this valid question.  The landing was smooth and we taxied to the gate.  When I opened the aircraft door; a woman from Flight Service and a mechanic were waiting for us.  I was the only crew member Flight Service spoke with.  She asked if we were OK.  During this time; two fire fighters with silver suits came up the jetbridge stairs; stood on the jetbridge for a few moments and left.  I kept asking if we blew a tire; as nobody explained to the flight attendants what had actually happened.  The Captain did not let us know on landing if the aircraft was OK or broken.  After many repeated questions upon arrival at the gate; I was told that nobody knew what was wrong with the plane because we had all our tires.  The cabin crew and passengers were informed that we would be changing aircraft and to go to the new gate.  This emergency was handled by the cockpit very poorly.  Company procedures were not followed.  The passengers were informed of the problem before the flight attendants were told; which is NOT procedure.  I had to initiate contact with the Captain.  He did not keep the flight attendants updated on the situation.  We had plenty of time to have gone through the emergency checklist; since we had to circle for so long.  If the Captain suspected it was going to be a rough landing; why did he say NOT to do the emergency checklist?  If the landing was going to be rough; I believe it is procedure for the Captain to say 'Brace'.  We never heard the 'Brace' command.  I was sitting on my jumpseat; waiting to land on the nose and go skidding across the runway with flames shooting out where the nosegear is supposed to be.  The flight attendants were not kept adequately and timely informed of the situation.,,,,MD80 flight attendant was notified by the cockpit crew they were going to return after blowing a nose tire.  The Flight Attendant feels this situation was not handled appropriately by the cockpit crew; creating a confused situation for the uninformed cabin crew.,"The incident involved a flight crew and cabin crew on an MD80 aircraft following a reported tire blowout shortly after takeoff. The flight attendant reported that the Captain informed passengers and the cabin crew about the incident but failed to maintain proper communication with the flight attendants throughout the event. The flight attendant expressed concerns about the lack of updates from the cockpit, which left the cabin crew and passengers in a state of uncertainty. The situation was further complicated by the Captain's refusal to follow standard emergency procedures, such as issuing a ""Brace"" command or allowing the cabin crew to execute the emergency checklist, despite having sufficient time to do so. The flight attendant also noted that the Captain did not provide adequate information upon landing, leaving the cabin crew uninformed about the aircraft's condition. The incident resulted in confusion and frustration among the cabin crew, who felt the cockpit crew mishandled the situation and did not adhere to company protocols. A proposed solution would involve improving communication between the cockpit and cabin crew during emergencies and ensuring adherence to established procedures to better manage such incidents.",communication issues

All takeoff bug speeds were verified in accordance with normal procedures. I was Captain and pilot flying. During takeoff roll; V1 auto-callout was announced by the aircraft 20 knots early. I eased back on the yoke and began rotation; when I realized I was below rotation speed. There was no pilot monitoring callout for rotation. I eased the nose of the aircraft back to the runway. I then rotated at the normal rotation speed and achieved approximately 10 degrees nose up at about 155-160 KTS. Everything else seemed normal. At 10;000 FT; after the sterile chime; a Flight Attendant asked me about the attempted rotation and set down. Her verbiage was approximately; 'What was that bump?' I explained what had happened and inquired if she heard any scraping. She said no. We pressurized normally and continued to our destination. At 3 hours into the flight (approximately); the flight attendants expressed concern that we had scraped the aircraft on takeoff; but were not sure. Upon receiving this new information; the copilot and I conducted the suspected tail-strike on takeoff portion of the QRH. We landed without declaring an emergency at our scheduled destination. After landing; and upon a post flight inspection; damage to the tail-skid was discovered. Dispatch and Chief Pilot were contacted.,,During preflight; I followed all normal procedures. The takeoff data V speeds did not automatically upload to the FMC. I manually inputted the correct V speed from the paperwork into the FMC. I verified they matched prior to pushback. There was no runway change from what I expected prior to pushback to what we received for our takeoff runway. During our takeoff roll; V1 was called early by the auto-voice. I think it was early by about 20 KTS. The Captain started a slow rotation. I knew it was too early; but was unsure of what procedure to advise him to stop rotation. I didn't want to say STOP or ROTATE for fear of confusion. He also recognized the problem shortly after I did and lowered the nose to the ground. Our takeoff then proceeded normally. After 10;000 FT; the Captain spoke with the Flight Attendant and she did not think there was a tail scraping during our takeoff. After about 3 hours more; the Flight Attendants decided we might have scraped some metal on takeoff. We did the QRH procedure for tail strike on takeoff and landed at our destination uneventfully. Because we suspected damage; we conducted a thorough exterior inspection and found some damage on the tail skid plate.,,A B737-800 Captain rotated 20 KTS below V1 when the autovoice V1 erroneously made the callout and then set down for a short period before rotating again. During the second rotation a tail strike occurred which flight attendants reported but the pilots did not immediately react to the report.,"The incident was triggered by an early V1 call from the auto-voice system during takeoff, prompting the Captain to rotate the aircraft prematurely. During takeoff, the Captain began rotating 20 knots below the required V1 speed due to the early call. Recognizing the issue, the Captain set the aircraft back down, then rotated again at the correct speed. Post-takeoff, a Flight Attendant inquired about a perceived bump, but the pilots initially ruled out any scraping. Three hours into the flight, the Flight Attendants expressed concern about potential damage, leading the pilots to consult the QRH for a tail strike. The aircraft landed safely, and a post-flight inspection revealed tail-skid damage. The aircraft sustained tail-skid damage but landed without emergency declaration. The incident highlighted the need for procedures to address early V1 calls and enhance crew communication during takeoffs. The investigation likely led to updated protocols for handling early V1 callouts and improving crew coordination to prevent similar incidents.",communication issues

It is very faint in flight.  I turned around and was prepared to keep the cockpit secure.  I saw that it was our First Flight Attendant.  He said that they had been trying to call us but the bells in the cockpit were not working.  We looked around and found that the handset at the back of the center console was slightly out of its cradle.  I was not aware that that silences all the call chimes in the cockpit.  We then had the flight attendants call us with the cockpit handset secured and off the hook and determined that it indeed does cut out the cockpit chimes when off the hook.  We flew on and landed as planned.  The flight was normal.  The man on the phone that asked for the report said there was some issue with my headset.  I don't know what that is about.  I was wearing the same headset that I have used for the last seven years; including all the check rides and flights with chief pilots and check airmen.  I have a noise canceling aviation headset.  It works great.  It protects my hearing and makes the HF radio clear and understandable.  It was plugged into the headset plugs in the airplane and I was monitoring 123.45 and 121.5.,The reporter states that the continuous chime announcing that the door unlock code had been entered was audible but not something that he had heard before and was therefore somewhat surprised when the cockpit door opened.,While in cruise; approximately 3 hours into flight; A Flight Attendant tried to check on our welfare; but we did not hear the inter phone chimes because the inter phone was not in its cradle properly or reset. Since there was no response from us; the Flight Attendant used the flight deck door code to enter the flight deck. I did not hear the door alarm. The cause of not hearing the flight deck inter phone chime was the improper cradling or reset of the hand set. Both myself and the First Officer were wearing head sets with both ears covered and I was listening to the HF radio and the common frequency for reports of turbulence; which I believe prevented us from hearing the door alarm.,,B757-200 flight crew is surprised to see the a Flight Attendant entering the cockpit to check on their welfare during a night flight over the Pacific.  The call bells were muted due to the handset not being in its' cradle and both pilots were wearing noise canceling headsets masking the door chimes.,"During a B757-200 flight over the Pacific, the flight crew was cruising at night when an incident occurred. The cause was identified as the cockpit handset being out of its cradle, which muted the call chimes. Additionally, the pilots were wearing noise-cancelling headsets, which prevented them from hearing the door alarm. The flight attendant attempted to contact the cockpit via interphone but received no response. As a result, the attendant used the door code to enter the cockpit. The pilots did not hear the door alarm, partly due to the headsets and their focus on monitoring the HF radio and common frequency. The incident was resolved when the crew secured the cockpit handset, restoring normal operations. The flight landed as planned without further issues. The proposed solution was to ensure the handset is properly secured to prevent similar occurrences.",communication issues

After I determined what the problem was I went to the jet bridge to call Maintenance Control. At the same time there was a Flight Attendant using the other phone on the jet bridge. As I was talking the Flight Attendant paused her conversation to ask me if it was OK to board the aircraft. I replied; 'No; it is not OK to board; please hold boarding'. She then advised the gate agent 'the mechanic said no; it is not OK to board'.After I finished my conversation with Maintenance Control; I went back to the cockpit to inform the Captain. I also informed the flight crew and the flight attendants that I had to go down in the E&E compartment to do a 'BITE' test on the IRU; and for them to not let any one near this area. At that point I proceed to go to the E&E compartment through the floor entrance.Shortly after I entered the E&E compartment I heard a noise. I looked to my right and discovered that someone had fallen into the E&E compartment. I asked the passenger if he was OK and he confirmed that he was. At that point I called out for help. After what seemed to be a minute or two the passenger stood up. I asked him again if he was OK and he said 'yes; I am OK'. At that point I watched him as he climbed out of the E&E compartment.,,The Captain attempted to help the individual who became belligerent and non-compliant to instructions from both him and the Purser.,,A Mechanic who needed to access the E&E compartment of a B767-300ER asked that boarding be delayed until he finished his maintenance procedure.

Despite this request, boarding commenced. During the process, a passenger fell through the floor access to the E&E compartment, resulting in minor injuries and temporary disorientation. The maintenance crew member had instructed everyone to stay away from the area, but the boarding proceeded regardless. After the fall, the passenger was able to stand and exit the compartment unassisted, with no serious harm reported.",communication issues

I could see the Ramp Agent pushing the stairs to the aft door; so I made the announcement that we would be deplaning out both the forward and aft exits. Although the door chime had not been given; the Ramp Agent opened the aft door and gave me a thumbs up to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots never told us to hold passengers and I could see that the 'A' Flight Attendant had opened the main cabin door; so I let passengers start to deplane. I did not realize an engine was still running due to problems with the APU. I was having trouble getting my ears to pop and could not hear very well. The ramp agents never told me to keep passengers on board. Even after the passengers started getting off; the ramp agents continued to unload bags. I didn't fully realize what had happened until we were in the taxi on our way to the hotel and Flight Attendant 'A' brought it up. We all should have communicated better and the aft door should not have been opened by the ramp until the engines were shut down and it was safe for passengers to deplane.We need to stress the importance of the ramp [personnel] being aware of what is going on around them. The ramp [personnel] are the eyes and ears for flight attendants as we can't always see or hear what is happening outside the aircraft. Also making sure the cabin crew is more observant; not always counting on the ramp [personnel] to give them accurate info.,,Opened main cabin door and found #2 engine still running in cool down mode. Did not deplane passengers until #2 engine was shut down. Observed passengers deplaning from back door of aircraft before #2 was shut down.Discovered GPU unit had not been properly hooked up to aircraft. Flight crew had shut down #1 [engine] and was waiting for ground crew to properly connect GPU; so they left #2 [engine] running in cool down mode much longer than normal. Flight crew shut down #2 [engine] upon learning main cabin door was open.,,Unaware that the right engine was still running; awaiting ground power; the Gate Agent and Flight Attendant at the aft main door of a Q400 opened the door and deplaned passengers.,"An incident occurred at a Q400 aircraft when passengers began deplaning through the aft door without the right engine being shut down, due to insufficient communication and awareness among the flight crew, ground personnel, and cabin crew. Upon arrival, the seatbelt signs were off, but the door chime was not received. The Ramp Agent opened the aft door, prompting the Flight Attendant to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots had shut down engine #1 but left engine #2 running, awaiting ground power unit connection. The flight attendant, unaware of the running engine, permitted deplaning. Another flight attendant noticed the engine still running and shut it down after passengers had started leaving. Passengers deplaned while engine #2 was running, posing a safety risk. Post-incident, all parties agreed on the need for enhanced communication and awareness. Improve communication and coordination among flight, ground, and cabin crew. Ground personnel should act as the eyes and ears for the flight crew. Cabin crew should enhance their observational skills and not solely rely on ground crew information. This incident highlights the importance of clear communication and situational awareness to prevent similar occurrences.",communication issues

The 'A' Flight Attendant and I told the Captain that we are on our first tray of drinks. We weren't able to take drink orders and pass out peanuts on the ground because as soon as the last passenger boarded the Operations Agent closed the front door. The Captain told us in five minutes it was reported we will fly into turbulence. We (flight attendants) asked the Captain do we need to stop beverage service. The Captain told us to continue to serve the passenger and he will call us back to let us know if it was safe to continue beverage service. Five minutes later the Captain called us and told us to continue service.After the 'A' Flight Attendant finished her last tray; she made a final descent announcement. The 'C' Flight Attendant and I hadn't finished our service. But when 'A' Flight Attendant made the final descent announcement; we stopped serving and went to the aft galley to clean up so we could be seated.The Captain called us and told the 'A' Flight Attendant that he heard her announcement and that we can continue to serve beverages. So the 'C' Flight Attendant and I re-poured our drinks. We (me and 'C' Flight Attendant) didn't realize how close to the ground we were when the Captain called and told us to finish our service. We were past the final descent stage of the flight; but yet the Captain told us to finish beverage service.The Captain never chimed for final descent in the final descent stage of the flight; but yet he chimed us to tell us to finish our beverage service. About two minutes after the captain called us to tell us to finish beverage service; we hit code four turbulence.We had a jumpseater on the jump seat; so the 'C' Flight Attendant got to the other side of the jump seat and I sat on the floor. Meanwhile the trays of beverages started to fall on me. Because we were in the approach stage of the flight with code four turbulence; it caused the trays of beverages to fall on me. The 'C' Flight Attendant made an attempt to make it to the front jump seat.As the plane was going forward; toward the ground; the can of beverages started falling out of the cabinets hitting me. I tried to close the cabinet doors so that the cans of beverages would not hit the jumpseater. Needless to say; I got drench by the drinks that were on the trays; I got hit multiple times by cans of beverages; and the aft galley floor was flooded with beverages.I'm not sure why the Captain told us to finish beverage service while we were in final descent stage of the flight. Maybe he was trying to impress (name) because he was on our flight. But whatever the reason was for the Captain to make such a reckless decision doing a crucial stage of the flight it caused a safety breach because while trying to close the cabinet doors we landed. If it is a 55 minute flight with expected turbulence; then the flight attendants need to remain seated and not do beverages service.,,,,Miscommunication between the Captain and the flight attendants regarding expected turbulence and passenger beverage services resulted in wet floors; wet clothing and exposure to possible injury on the part of those in the cabin.,"The incident occurred during a flight when miscommunication between the captain and the flight attendants regarding expected turbulence and beverage service led to a safety breach. Approximately ten minutes after the 10,000-foot chime, the captain instructed the flight attendants to continue serving beverages despite impending turbulence. The flight attendants were unaware of their proximity to the ground when the captain told them to finish their service, which occurred during the final descent stage. Shortly after, the aircraft encountered Code Four turbulence, causing beverage trays to fall and flood the aft galley. Flight attendants were struck by falling cans and the jumpseater was exposed to potential injury. The captain’s decision to allow beverage service during a critical phase of the flight resulted in a messy and unsafe situation. The flight attendant suggested that flight attendants should remain seated during the final descent if turbulence is expected to avoid such incidents.",communication issues

He then switched us to SOCAL final. We checked in with SOCAL final and were immediately cleared for the visual approach to 24R. We read back the clearance; turned 10 degrees right; and began a descent to the normal 2500 foot alt for the LAX visual. Shortly the controller asked our heading and we responded 150. He said turn left 130. He then asked our altitude. We stated descending through 4500. He asked what our assigned altitude was. We responded that we had been cleared for the visual approach. His response was 'no; you were not cleared for the visual approach; you were told to expect it. Maintain 4000 and turn left to 100.' we responded leveling 4000; heading 100; and we understood we had been cleared for the visual approach and that was the clearance we had read back to him. He then vectored us to final and again cleared us for the visual approach 24R.  Although there was not much traffic; I distinctly heard two different controller voices on SOCAL final. So maybe there was some miscommunication in TRACON. And maybe the controller meant to say expect; but actually said cleared; I've been guilty of that. But I guess the bottom line is we heard the clearance and read it back and received no correction. There was no traffic conflict throughout this incident.  I think the controller(s) just made a mistake.,,,,A Q400 flight crew suffered a breakdown in communications with approach control regarding whether they had been 'cleared for' or were 'to expect' a visual approach to LAX.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between the Approach Controller and the Q400 flight crew regarding a visual approach clearance to LAX. Initially, the crew was cleared for the visual approach, which they read back and began executing. However, the controller later corrected the crew's altitude and heading, stating they were not cleared for the visual approach but had been told to expect it. The crew, hearing no further correction, adhered to their initial understanding. The confusion may have stemmed from miscommunication in TRACON, as two controller voices were heard on SOCAL final. Despite this, the flight proceeded without traffic conflicts, indicating the issue was a procedural mistake without serious consequences.",communication issues

I asked him: Did the Purser call you and tell you that we were in the aisle doing our cabin safety checks because I was still in the aisle when you took off'. He said to me 'The Purser said give me two seconds. We were on the runway and if we would have pulled off then we would have had to wait 30 minutes'. I again told him 'Well I was still in the aisle when you guys took off. Thank you I just needed to check what had happened.',,,,An A320 crew took off with a flight attendant in the aisle performing the cabin safety check.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the flight crew of an A320 aircraft.

Despite the safety video not being completed and the cabin safety checks not being fully executed, the cockpit proceeded with takeoff. The flight attendant was still in the aisle when the aircraft began rolling down the runway and had to rush to her jumpseat to secure herself before takeoff. After reaching 18,000 feet, she informed the purser, who had communicated with the cockpit.

Flight attendants were not aware that the Captain was armed (due to lack of briefing by the Captain and lack of CLR). The FAMs did not know the Captain was armed (due to lack of CLR and proper briefing with Captain) and in turn the Captain was unaware of the presence of FAMs on the flight. In addition I as Purser was completely distracted from my boarding and Pre-Departure duties. I was not able to provide any safety and security vigilance that is expected of me during the boarding process. This was all due to the fact that our Captain became upset over me serving him his coffee with cream on the side instead of inside the coffee. As the result of this a confrontation ensued between myself and the Captain that lasted throughout the boarding process. The action taken by the Captain and the inflight supervisor was to remove me from the Purser position. My flying partner took over being Purser to appease the Captain. However that did not change the fact that the working crew (both flight attendants and cockpit) was unaware of the armed FAMs onboard and as well as the FAMs were unaware that the Captain was armed.,,,,An air carrier Flight Attendant reported flight attendants and pilots were both unaware that FAMs were on board; and the flight attendants and FAMs were unaware the Captain was an FFDO.  Problem reportedly stemmed from lack of communication resulting from friction between the purser and the Captain before departure.,"The incident occurred due to a lack of communication and briefing between the flight crew, specifically the purser, and the captain. The purser was unaware of the presence of armed Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) on board and the fact that the captain was an FFDO (Federal Flight Deck Officer). Similarly, the FAMs were also unaware of the captain's status. The issue originated from a disagreement between the purser and the captain regarding the serving of coffee, which distracted the purser from their duties and led to a confrontation during the boarding process. As a result, the captain and in-flight supervisor removed the purser from their position, and the purser's partner took over.

I was in the galley next to door two and there had been a jetbridge at door one.  When the door closed I knew that there was an agent on board still so I thought that there was a jetbridge at door one.  I didn't even realize that we had begun to push back until I heard a commotion and saw the Customer Service Agent in the aisle saying that someone needed to call the cockpit and tell them to go back to the gate and I looked out the window to see that we had begun to be pushed back.  We returned to the gate the Agent got off and when the jetbridge pulled away that time I armed my door and made the PA to arm doors to the rest of the crew.,,I was working Flight Attendant #6 in economy walking around closing bins; my exit row had been briefed as it was getting close to departure. I went to verify with my flying partner #5 is she had a chance to brief her exit row so that I could relay the message to the purser so that way he knew the exits at 4L&R were briefed. She had not done her exits and I started to go back to brief her exit (and I completed the briefing for her) and I thought I saw something moving outside. I was unsure if the plane was moving or if it was ground crew. I then noticed the aircraft was moving and asked did anyone hear arm doors? My flying partner at 3R said no she armed 3L&R. I went back to arm 4L&R as we were pushing back. I then ask about the agent that I saw in conomy that she was still on the plane. The captain came over the PA said we were going back to the gate to let the Gate Agent off the aircraft after they radioed to operations they were onboard. I then heard disarm doors. Then a minute or so later I hear arm doors and we continue with the flight. I ask my flying partners what happened that was in business they said the door was just shut without them being told it was ok. I asked one of the flying partners about how was cabin ready given when the doors were not armed. They did not know.,,In the quest for an on-time departure; B747 flight attendants report door closure and pushback commencement with a Customer Service Agent still on board.,"An incident occurred involving a B747 flight where a miscommunication led to a gate agent remaining onboard during the plane's pushback. The flight attendants were distracted, with one not arming the door or making an announcement, believing the jetbridge was still in place. The other attendant, focused on exit row procedures, noticed movement and realized the plane was moving without proper communication. The flight crew responded by returning to the gate to allow the agent to disembark, then arming the doors and resuming the flight.

The biohazard guys came on and found that a young boy had a temperature of 38.7; 38 being normal. They decided to quarantine him; his row; the rows in front and back of him; and something like 6 flight attendants; who had served him. One of them told a language speaker that a doctor was coming and would check him on board.  After about 20 minutes; the station manager finally showed up and said that to protect their departure on the 13th; the Chinese authorities would accept just one Flight Attendant. She didn't want to speak to me; and tried to ignore me; but I got involved in the conversation and asked where the doctor was; since this boy was only a fraction of a degree above normal; which may be normal for him. She didn't have a clue; and suddenly didn't seem to understand English anymore.  The purser and I asked her how they were going to determine which Flight Attendant would be quarantined. She said we should choose. We both said we would not do that; that we had no right to order someone to go into quarantine. She said then she would choose. When I asked her what she would do when that person refused; she again didn't understand English. I guess she's not used to people not obeying her.  Finally; the Purser said he would stay. I applaud him for doing that; but what makes this even more bizarre is that he never came into contact with the boy. I asked that station manager why not just send a customer service agent to go with the quarantined people; since they are local and speak the language. She didn't seem to understand my question...again.  Now here's the safety issue:  One of our crew members; who was completely healthy; was forced to go to a non-western hotel; where sick people were being held in quarantine; and given no bottled water (only purification tablets to use with tap water).

Biohazard personnel, led by a station manager, enforced these measures. The manager initially stated that only one flight attendant could depart, causing a conflict with the flight crew. The crew refused to select someone for quarantine, leading the manager to decide. The purser volunteered to stay, despite not being in contact with the boy. The Captain questioned why a customer service agent couldn't accompany the quarantined individuals, but the manager didn't respond. A safety concern arose as a healthy crew member was sent to a hotel with sick individuals, provided only with purification tablets and tap water. The purser's decision to stay and the Captain's suggestion for customer service involvement highlighted the need for improved quarantine protocols.",communication issues

Approaching FIR received ATC message time-stamped XA:35Z instructing we contact ATC frequency 124.XX MHZ.  Crew acknowledged ATC instructions via CPDLC at time XA:35Z; and attempted voice contact per ATC instructions.  ATC MESSAGE EICAS memo message and SENDING CDU prompt remained displayed for what would be a period of 6 minutes.  After time-out period; CDU displayed ATC MESSAGE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED.  During this time interval crew unsuccessfully attempted contact ATC 124.XX MHZ. ATC sent a second datalink message after the auto-generated ATC MESSAGE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED FMC alert message. This read: 'Attempt voice contact ATC'.  There was no PRINT or SEND prompt to this second datalink communication; and this message was not recorded in the CPDLC log.  However; either this second ATC datalink message; or-- more probably-- the timing out of the first message; allowed programming logic to re-enable CDU send prompt; which the PF immediately selected.  This second response (to the first ATC message) is time-stamped XA:41Z.  Meanwhile the pilot not flying was successful with voice relay through aircraft on frequency to ATC; and voice communications were soon established with ATC on an alternate frequency.  The airplane ACARS system processes all Company and ATC datalink messages to and from the airplane.  At time XA:39Z we received; on ACARS; the first of three cabin write-up acknowledgments called in presumably by the Chief Purser.  Crew's observation is this co-incidental occupation of FMC datalink processor/buffering delayed ATC datalink communication.  As a crewmember on international flights; I have long been frustrated by some Chief Purser's habits of sending non-essential cabin items both without coordinating this activity with the flight crew on duty; and/or initiating sending no essential cabin items so early in the flight.  FOM states 'Purser will consult with Captain prior to using ACARS'.  Some do not.  Some are briefed; as happened on this occasion; by a Captain during preflight briefing; that using ACARS is appropriate and approved by the Captain.  This leaves timing of ACARS usage to the sole discretion of the Chief purser; and its use may very well be at a time in flight that the Captain never imagined. Additionally; Pursers are not trained to envision how cabin write-ups affect the dispatch ability of an aircraft in event of diversion.  I am not suggesting these write-ups not be recorded for the above reason; I am suggesting; however; that legality of dispatch makes it ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT that the Captain be advised IMMEDIATELY prior to using the cabin ACARS.  At any rate; if indeed the use of the cabin ACARS interfered with ATC communications; as it appears it did; a wholly unacceptable-- an unnecessary-- communication interruption can occur.  The use of the cabin ACARS must be limited to non-controller pilot datalink communications/ADS operations.  I believe this report is particularly important given a recent fleet communication regarding timeliness of aircrew responses to CPDLC instructions from ATC.,,I was the Captain on this flight. I was in the bunk asleep during this matter. I had briefed the Chief Purser that she could use the cabin ACARS for cabin write ups. The aircraft was approaching FIR and was given a CPDLC message to contact ATC on 124.XX. The relief pilots were unable to acknowledge this and the message timed out. In the mean time they had relayed communications through another aircraft and eventually got in contact on 124.XX. We believe the message could not get through to CPDLC because at the same time the Chief Purser was sending in cabin write-ups on the cabin ACARS. I need to make sure to have the Purser check with me for the appropriate time to do the cabin ACARS as this caused a delay in our being able to communicate with ATC.,,A pilot reported that the Flight Attendants use of the cabin ACARS during international operations interfered with CPDLC/ADS communications with ATC.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew, Air Traffic Control (ATC), and a flight attendant during international operations. ATC transmitted a message instructing the crew to contact a specific frequency, but the crew faced difficulties acknowledging this due to interference from cabin ACARS usage. The flight attendant used the cabin ACARS to send cabin write-ups, coinciding with the timing out of the ATC message. This interference led to a delay in establishing communication with ATC. The proposed solution is to restrict cabin ACARS usage to non-controller communications and require the purser to consult the captain before using it, ensuring coordination and preventing future disruptions.",communication issues

The #2 engine's vibration gauge started to slowly increase into the abnormal range. We ran the QRH; and were only able to maintain the normal range at approximately 70% power setting. Because that thrust setting was too low to maintain cruise flight at FL 320; we determined it was necessary to divert to ZZZ. The flight continued with no other problems and a normal landing was accomplished. We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance to discuss the problem. After telling Dispatch where we were and that we needed an airport for diversion ZZZ was selected as the new destination airport and ATC was advised. An Emergency was declared. During the discussions; Maintenance Control advised us to follow the QRH and shut down the #2 engine. We asked multiple questions; but the only answer given was to follow the QRH. I asked the Maintenance Control person if he was even looking at the QRH for this problem and he admitted he wasn't. I asked him to reference the QRH with me. They still persisted to follow the QRH. We asked to speak with a Chief Pilot and the Program Manager; but our Dispatcher told us none were available and that a phone patch wouldn't work. During this conversation with Maintenance; we learned that the #2 engine had experienced this same problem the week before; and that the wrong engine had been fixed.  The rationale for our decision to forgo engine shutdown was the first caution note; printed in bold; in the QRH for Engine Fan Vibration which states; 'It is not recommended that an engine be shut down unless there is another indication of a severe engine abnormality; i.e; high oil temperature; high oil pressure or abnormal vibration is felt through the airframe.' All other engine gauges and parameters were normal and comparable to the left engine.  We did not feel any vibration through the air frame.  We also discussed that in the descent; the thrust would be back and would most likely remain in the normal range.  The descent was initiated for the diversion and we were able to control the vibration all the way to landing at ZZZ thus not needing an engine shut-down. Even though both the Captain and I had talked with the flight attendants about the diversion and possible engine problem; they never mentioned that the engine sounded louder than normal.  It wasn't until we were on the ground; that the aft Flight Attendant said that there was a louder than normal sound coming from the engine.  Recommendation Regarding Contract Maintenance. We decided not to fly the aircraft out of ZZZ due to multiple findings; including:  1) the fact that we couldn't verify the aircraft was legal to fly after corrective work had been performed on the wrong engine; 2) the very poor inspection done by contract maintenance. Even other ground crew personnel told us that they should not be trusted. It is our belief that the Contract Maintenance person never inspected the #2 engine. (We had questioned him how he looked at the blades and if he opened up the cowling.  He said he didn't open the cowling and that he had used the belt loader because a ladder wouldn't be tall enough to reach the engine.  We mentioned the belt loader was not on that side of the aircraft and he laughed and then stated 'You couldn't see anything from examining the blades anyway.'  (Yet he wrote in the corrective action of the log book that he inspected the blades).  The only time we were able to communicate with this person was when he finally came up to the cockpit for the run-up. After the run-up; he concluded that the engine was fine; and that we were good to go. Back at the gate; he took the maintenance book to sign off the engine; but had to come back and find out which engine we experienced trouble with. (This contradicts the fact he wrote that he inspected the blades. Had he inspected the blades; he would've known which engine had the vibe).  A decision to not use these contract maintenance personnel should be highly considered. Always get a Chief Pilot when requested.  We are encouraged from day one of CRM to utilize all our resources and we requested these resources but were denied access to them.  Maintenance Control often appears 'disengaged' to the problems the crew is encountering and the only answer they give to any questions for help or problem solving is 'Follow the QRH' even when presented with contradictory or unclear QRH procedures to follow.  Isn't maintenance there to help be a useful resource and problem solve?  Don't use this contract maintenance provider in the future.,,,,High engine vibration indications initiated an ongoing exchange with the commuter airline's dispatch and maintenance control organizations that the reporter deemed ineffective. Flight diverted and canceled,"The incident involved a flight crew encountering engine vibration issues, leading to a diversion and cancellation. After takeoff, the #2 engine's vibration gauge indicated abnormal levels, prompting the crew to follow the QRH. However, the suggested power settings were inadequate for cruising, necessitating a diversion to ZZZ. Communication with Maintenance Control was deemed ineffective, as they failed to provide meaningful assistance beyond directing the crew to adhere to the QRH. The crew elected not to shut down the engine, as the vibration was not severe enough, and successfully landed at ZZZ. Post-landing, the crew learned that a flight attendant had noticed a louder engine noise, which the crew had not detected. The crew identified multiple issues with the contract maintenance, including a prior incorrect engine repair and a lack of thorough inspection. The maintenance team's unprofessional conduct and inability to competently inspect the engine led the crew to cancel the flight from ZZZ. The crew recommended against using the contract maintenance provider and criticized Maintenance Control for its disengagement and lack of problem-solving support. The flight was ultimately diverted and canceled due to these maintenance and communication shortcomings.",communication issues

Spoke to the Purser about this because there had been no information for passenger on oxygen on our briefing sheet. Later a passenger service representative boarded; letting us know that; indeed; we would have a passenger on oxygen. Fortunately; the agent had seen the passenger in the boarding area and saw that the passenger would not be using a nasal cannula but a trachea cannula instead. Everything on the aircraft had been incorrectly set up for a nasal cannula.  The agent redid the hoses and explained how to change the tanks.  The passenger was with his family and a paramedic in the boarding area but the paramedic was not allowed to board per a TSA officer even though the Captain had allowed it.  So; five minutes before departure the passenger is hastily boarded; along with his wife and 2 daughters who are traveling with him. I am given no additional/further medical information and am trying to communicate with people who speak limited English. One of the daughters questions me if the flight goes all the way to Vietnam. I tell her the flight number does but that everyone needs to deplane in VHHH. She becomes worried and says her father needs to stay on the oxygen and that they had been told that they wouldn't have to deplane. She makes a quick phone call and I speak to the Doctor. She is concerned about the VHHH stop because they had NOT been told about this. I assured them that they would have oxygen in VHHH and that everything was already taken care of because the computer booking would have alerted someone that this wasn't a nonstop flight. The doors were already closed at this time so I told the daughter that we would follow through and confirm with VHHH later on during the flight. I spoke with the Purser about this and we both felt it was important to follow up with VHHH because everything else related to our passenger had been very unorganized and mismanaged. Luckily; we had a Flight Attendant that spoke Vietnamese.  I asked her to speak to the family after takeoff and reassure them that the oxygen would have already been prearranged in VHHH.  Later; when the Vietnamese literate Flight Attendant was on her break; our passenger needed to use the bathroom.  I tried to communicate with the family to see how long he could be without oxygen and I couldn't really get a straight answer because of the language barrier. I erred on the side of caution and we strapped a portable oxygen bottle around the daughter who was assisting her father to the bathroom. The Purser had communicated to the cockpit the need for verification that we would have oxygen for the passenger in VHHH. Eventually; the cockpit received a message that the passenger had been advised in their PNR that there would be no oxygen in VHHH!!!!! And if they need it; it would be $250 USD. The Vietnamese speaker spoke to the family and they became a bit upset because here we are getting close to landing and we are making last minute arrangements for oxygen. Upon landing someone comes down the aisle with an aisle wheel chair and no oxygen. I had to forcefully let them know our passenger could not be moved without oxygen. The Purser; myself and a few of the economy flight attendants stayed on board for 40 minutes with the passenger and his family while company customer service representatives explained to the family that the price of the oxygen would be around $500 USD!!!!! This was due to the cost of a Doctor or Nurse needing to be there and there was a minimum charge for a set number of hours. The family became very distressed. The father was on his deathbed and this was his last flight so he could die in Vietnam and they had been given wrong information. It was devastating for us to see how poorly this family had been treated by our Company. More importantly; it was dangerous that someone didn't follow throughproperly. This family was basically shoved on the airplane without proper medical information ever being gathered and placed in his computer record and communicated to the crew.  Subsequently; the paramedic should have been allowed to board.  By to let the paramedic board; important medical information was not able to be conveyed to the crew due to the language barrier.,,,,A Purser relates her concerns about the services provided a passenger traveling with special medical needs.,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",communication issues

At one point Purser walked away from Captain during a conversation involving safety issues. During layover; Captain made decision to replace Purser with another Flight Attendant. Captain ordered initial Purser to work in coach (or at least not as Purser) but the Purser refused to follow Captain's orders.  Captain and First Officers agreed we could not work with this Flight Attendant and requested that a Flight Operations Manager remove him from flight. Ultimately; the remaining flight attendants wanted to walk if Purser was removed from aircraft. All agreed that they felt the Captain was unsafe if Purser was removed.  Pilot talked to the Flight Operations Manager on a conference call and decided to allow Purser to fly as passenger. Purser agreed to ride as passenger. Flight Attendants never recanted on their reference to the unsafe feature regarding the Captain. Second Purser took over. Northbound flight was uneventful. This was simply a communal lack of respect of Captain's authority culminating in a mutiny. At no time was safety compromised.

The issue escalated when the Purser, a senior cabin crew member, refused to comply with the Captain's orders, leading to a decision by the Captain and First Officers to request the removal of the Purser from the flight. This decision was met with resistance from other flight attendants, who expressed concerns about the Captain's safety if the Purser was removed. After a conference call with the Flight Operations Manager, it was agreed that the Purser would fly as a passenger on the remainder of the journey rather than continue in his role. The remaining flight attendants maintained their stance that they could not work safely under the Captain's authority if the Purser was removed.

The gate Agent gave us a loadsheet showing 51 Passengers.  The fuel audit checked and all the numbers added correctly.  The head Flight Attendant gave us a napkin which also had 51 Passengers.  The takeoff and climb were all normal.  During our climb one of the Flight Attendants rang us and said the passenger count was 81.  I asked her to verify the count two more times.  She still said the count was 81 not 51. The First Officer adjusted the zero fuel weight by adding 5;800 lbs to the FMC to account for 30 Passenger error.  Upon arrival I called Operations and spoke to a Supervisor.  He asked what revision number was on my loadsheet and I replied Revision zero.  He informed me the loadsheet was revised three times and it was closed out at 81 Passengers.  So the error occurred when the Agent gave us the original loadsheet which was incorrect and the Flight Attendant did not actually perform a passenger count but instead went off the loadsheet. I spoke with the Flight Attendants and informed them how important it is to actually perform the count to crosscheck the Agent's number.,,The 'perfect storm' of two compound errors led to this event. A correct count by the Flight Attendants would have allowed us to catch the error on the loading schedule. Flight Attendants need to understand the importance of an accurate Passenger count; that it is not just a 'nice-to-know' number on a napkin. Given the information provided to us; I do not think there was any way for the Captain or I to catch this error. I will continue to crosscheck the loading schedule; FMC; and fuel; etc.; in order to ensure correct data to the best of my ability.,,A B737-700 Flight Crew took off with 81 passengers vice the 51 reported by the load planners; passed on to the Flight Attendants by the Gate Agent and thence to the Flight Crew.  A subsequent revised weight and balance document was not delivered.  The additional passengers increased the takeoff gross weight nearly 6000 pounds over that used for takeoff performance computations.,"The incident involved a B737-700 flight where an incorrect passenger count led to an overweight takeoff. The ground personnel provided a loadsheet stating 51 passengers, but the actual count was 81. The flight attendants did not verify the count and relied on the loadsheet. During the climb, the discrepancy was noticed, prompting the crew to adjust the zero fuel weight. However, the loadsheet had been revised three times without proper communication. The overweight takeoff posed a safety risk, and the crew later adjusted the weight. The flight supervisor emphasized the importance of accurate passenger counts to crosscheck loadsheet data, highlighting the need for better communication and verification processes.",communication issues
