Passenger; Person A; who just happens to also be a non-rev; asked if there are any outlets. I directed to them. Their block was broken so I allowed them to use my charger. As we are inflight I am doing my service and walking and asking my first class passengers if they need anything. Around XA:30 I notice my charger was out of the outlet. Right then shocked me of what I just saw. They were charging their e-cigarette in the outlet. My jaw dropped as to what I just witnessed. They asked if that was okay to charge. And I said absolutely not! They comply and puts it away. My question though if these are rules we have to follow on a daily basis and we hear announcements all the time about this; how did they not think this was okay to do? Furthermore; who to say they haven't done this on any other flights non-revving.,,,,CRJ-900 Flight Attendant reported a non-rev passenger was charging an e-cigarette during the flight. The Flight Attendant directed the passenger to discontinue and the passenger complied.,"The incident occurred on a CRJ-900 flight, involving a forward flight attendant (Party1) and a non-revenue (non-rev) passenger (Party2). During the flight, the passenger requested an outlet and was directed to use one. Later, the flight attendant noticed the passenger charging an e-cigarette in the outlet, which is against airline policies. The flight attendant instructed the passenger to stop, and the passenger complied. The flight attendant expressed surprise that the passenger did not recognize the restriction, given the airline's regular announcements about such rules. No further action was reported beyond the passenger discontinuing the activity.",electronic cigarettes

I knocked on the aft lavatory; as there was a passenger using it.  'Are you ok?' I asked.  ' Yes. But what's that sound?' She replied as a big plume of smoke/vapor came toward me when she opened the door.[I pointed out that] smoking on an aircraft is a federal offense. So you really don't want to do that. I checked the waste receptacle and the shelves above it. As well as the toilet bowl; sink; and the little cupboard that holds the toilet paper and Kleenex. All clear. It didn't smell like tobacco.I asked the passenger if it was an e-cigarette; she said yes. I let the CA know what happened so he could handle it on his end. The passenger seemed totally taken aback that smoking wasn't allowed on planes and kept repeating that she didn't know it wasn't allowed. Also wearing the personal; disposable face mask made it hard to smell the smoke/vapor plumage that came out of the bathroom. That's why I asked her if it was an e-cigarette. Since I didn't see any smoking device/paraphernalia.As helpful as the personal face masks are for filtering out bacteria and viruses; it's difficult to make out scents fully. But since it was an exhalation of vapor from an e-cigarette it's not like I want to take off the mask to be able to identify the smell due to COVID concerns. That's why a thorough search for any burning or foreign material was done along with asking what she was using.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that the smoke detector alarm was triggered by a passenger smoking an e-cigarette in a lavatory. Flight Attendant stated that wearing a personal face mask made it hard to smell the smoke/vapor plumage to determine whether the smell was due to an e-cigarette or other burning material.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a smoke detector alarm was triggered in the aft galley. A flight attendant noticed the alarm and knocked on the aft lavatory door to check on the passenger inside. Upon opening the door, a plume of smoke or vapor emerged. The flight attendant questioned the passenger about the source of the smoke, explaining that smoking on an aircraft is a federal offense. The passenger claimed she was using an e-cigarette and was unaware that it was prohibited. The flight attendant conducted a thorough search of the lavatory, including the waste receptacle, shelves, toilet bowl, sink, and cupboard, but found no evidence of smoking paraphernalia or burning material. The passenger expressed surprise at the禁烟 policy, attributing her inability to detect the smell to her face mask, which she was wearing for COVID-19 protection.

Shortly after; we both felt our throats burning. C Flight Attendant said she also saw smoke inside the lavatory. passenger also seemed paranoid. We called the Captain and notified him of the events.Police met the aircraft and questioned the passenger. Initially passenger lied to the police saying he didn't do anything. Police Officers and TSA came onto the plane looking for evidence and could not find anything. When we deplaned the aircraft we stayed in the gate area while on the phone with Operations. In the gate area; we noticed the passenger shaking the police officers hand and walking away. As he was walking away; he dropped the vape pen on the ground and picked it up. We notified the police and they detained him. The police tested the vape pen and it tested positive for THC (marijuana). The passenger then confessed to smoking in the back lavatory and in the cabin among other passenger. At the time of writing this; my throat is still burning and I have a headache. I do feel a little off and not sure if it is the stress of the event or effects of the THC.,,Passenger came onboard; confused about seating. We explained to him we have an opening seating policy. When I came around to take his order; he; confusingly reading the menu; asked for items we didn't have on the menu. He then orders a Jack and Coke. I checked his ID to make sure he was of age and said no problem. As I was taking the next rows order; he interrupts me asking where to buy the snacks. I explained to him we'd be around shortly with pretzels as our snack option. As I went back to taking orders; he interrupts me again asking if he could use the lavatory. I explained to him the seatbelt sign was on and I was not able to give him permission as long as the seatbelt sign was illuminated. At this point; I finished taking orders and waited behind the B Flight Attendant as she finished taking her last row of orders. Passenger apparently got up right after I informed him the seatbelt sign was on because I felt a hard tap on my shoulder of him explaining he had to use the bathroom. I told him politely that we both needed to wait until she was done taking her last order. At this point; I informed the B of unusually behavior from him. As I was pouring drinks and the B was putting pretzels in the snack basket; the passenger came bolting out of the lavatory; leaving the door wide open. As I went to close the door; the B and I both realized he smelled strongly of marijuana. I walked into the lavatory and smelled an even greater odor of marijuana. There is no doubt in my mind at this point; that the passenger was smoking weed in the bathroom. We went up to talk to the A; called the Captain and all decided that we needed police assistance upon landing. We also decided to monitor the passenger. Passenger appeared paranoid and edgy as he watched us call the Captain and watched each of us every time we walked by. Upon landing; police met him and questioned him. He admitted to using a vape pen but said it was not marijuana. He said he could not find said vape pen. Ultimately he had to be let go for no evidence. As passenger was walking away; he [waved] good bye to police and the vape pen fell out of his pants. He was taken into custody and I wrote a police report. The vape pen was tested positive for marijuana. Passenger also admitted to smoking in the cabin during his interrogation.,,Flight attendants reported misconduct by a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight.,"The incident involved a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight, leading to a conflict with the flight attendants.

The passenger was detained, and the flight attendants reported the incident to the authorities.

Additionally the passenger reported he saw smoke emanating from the overhead panel in the lavatory. Uncharacteristic of him simply smoking in the lavatory; but possibly something much more serious and potentially life-threatening; an actual aircraft fire. The smoke alarm was activated and projecting an extremely loud and piercing tone throughout the cabin. This caused distress among passengers as well as the FA's. Communicating with the FA's over the interphone was very difficult due to the combined chaotic nature of the alarm and the chaos surrounding its activation. The FA's were having difficulty extinguishing the alarm. I did not know if this was due to continued smoke; or some delay in extinguishing the alarm. Our collective belief was the situation could be much more serious. The FA's asked me for assistance in evaluating the situation. I knew my assistance in the aft of the aircraft would be a departure from our standard protocol. However; based on the information we received at the time; I concluded my assistance might very well mitigate a further degradation in the cabin and secure a safe condition as quickly as possible. The First Officer had demonstrated confidence and technical competence; thus I had no reason to doubt her ability to navigate and control the aircraft; as well as communicate with outside agencies while I assisted the FA's with what appeared and sounded to be a rapidly deteriorating situation. In the interest of time and consequently safety; I elected to personally inspect and evaluate the severity of the incident. I did this in order to determine the most expeditious course of action regarding continuing to [our destination] or turning back.As we were mere minutes from the critical point on our flight plan there was only one FA present in the forward part of the aircraft during the time I exited the flight deck. I shut the flight deck door before the forward FA could enter the flight deck. After working with the FA's to silence the alarm and after inspecting the lavatory and it's overhead panel; I determined there was no immediate threat of an actual aircraft fire; as there was no evidence of heat; burning; or residual smoke. I instructed the FA's to lock the lavatory; and reassess every few minutes. After I returned to the front of the aircraft; I established communication with the First Officer via interphone; and advised her I was ready to return to the flight deck; (after approximately 4-5 minutes). The smoke did not continue; so I opted to continue to [our destination]; as long as the condition didn't reappear. For reasons unknown to me; the First Officer left her seat to open the door rather than pushing the unlock button. About twenty minutes later; the FA's found an electronic cigarette in the toilet that was discarded in what appears to be an attempt to conceal its presence and cause for the smoke. After the passenger (who reported the smoke emanating from the overhead portion of the lavatory) was asked about the device; he did admit it was the cause for the smoke and activation of the smoke detector. I felt in the interest of safety; it was best to leave the flight deck and assess the situation personally; and that would be the most expeditious way to evaluate an overall course of action.At no time during the above events did I intentionally disregard standard procedure; rather I utilized my authority as the Captain to bring the situation to safe conclusion while being mindful of [Company policies].,,,,B737 Captain reported leaving the flight deck to evaluate smoke in the aft lav caused by a passenger's electronic cigarette.,"The incident involved a B737 flight crew responding to smoke in the aft lavatory, which was traced to a passenger's electronic cigarette. Upon notification, the smoke alarm activated, causing cabin chaos. The captain, departing from standard protocol, left the flight deck to personally assess the situation, concluding no immediate fire hazard existed. After extinguishing the alarm and inspecting the lavatory, the captain instructed the flight attendants to lock the lavatory and monitor the situation. Despite the First Officer's departure from standard procedure by opening the flight deck door, the captain returned and decided to continue the flight to the destination. Later, the flight attendants found the electronic cigarette, confirming its role in the incident. The captain's actions prioritized safety, aligning with company policies.",electronic cigarettes

I directed the flight deck crew to don oxygen masks and set the regulators to 100 percent and established crew communication. I then [advised] ATC and asked for direct [destination]. Shortly thereafter; the Flight Attendants notified us that the device and its spare batteries (which were also in a state of thermal runaway) were contained in the ion battery emergency containment bag and there was no smoke.The device was apparently an e-cigarette. As the device was contained and there was no smoke; I elected to discontinue the QRH. However; the flight deck crew remained on oxygen for the duration of the approach and landing. Approach and landing were uneventful. My biggest concern is that after attempting to notify the Flight Attendants that we were on oxygen; I never called them back. They were making announcements on my first attempt and I simply dropped calling them back off my to-do list. They were surprised when we landed and were surrounded by Fire Rescue.Distraction management continues to be an issue for all flight crews. As a Check Airman; I should have done a better job of communicating. Better use of all my resources would have kept this from happening. I found myself doing the lion's share of the work in the cockpit when I had a very competent First Officer to help me. Simply dividing a few more of the tasks would have freed up my mind and allowed me to think more clearly.,,,,B737 Captain reported the flight crew donned oxygen masks and asked for direct destination after a Flight Attendant reported smoke in the cabin related to thermal runaway of an e-cigarette battery.,"The incident occurred during the arrival into [destination] when smoke was reported in the cabin due to an e-cigarette battery experiencing thermal runaway. The flight crew donned oxygen masks, communicated with the flight deck team, and requested a direct approach to [destination]. The flight attendants successfully contained the device and its spare batteries in an ion battery emergency containment bag, resolving the smoke issue. Despite the situation being controlled, the flight crew remained on oxygen throughout the approach and landing. Upon landing, the flight crew was surrounded by Fire Rescue, surprising the flight attendants who had been making announcements. The incident highlighted a communication lapse, with the captain failing to follow up with the flight attendants after initially notifying them of the oxygen use. The captain acknowledged the need for better resource management and delegation, recognizing that shared responsibilities could have mitigated the distractions and improved communication.",electronic cigarettes
