2102491,Flight Attendant,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved an off-duty Flight Attendant (Party1) who attempted to assist during a safety procedure on a flight. The aircraft experienced an issue with the landing gear, prompting the captain to conduct a preparation for land evacuation demonstration. During this time, Party1, who was in uniform and seated in the cabin, volunteered to assist by taking on the role of FA #8 at the jump seat in the aft galley. However, the Purser (Party2) denied this offer, instructing Party1 to return to their seat in the cabin, stating that only working Flight Attendants should be involved in the safety procedure. After landing, the off-duty Flight Attendants (deadhead crew) were reassigned to work the next departing flight, which caused significant fatigue due to being awake for approximately 27 hours. This decision was particularly challenging because the deadhead crew had less time available compared to the on-duty crew, who were subsequently released from their duties. The inconsistency in treatment and the denial of assistance led to frustration among the deadhead crew, who felt their efforts and well-being were overlooked despite being part of the same incident.

The captain assessed the situation, determined it was under control, and communicated with dispatch to keep them informed. The flight proceeded, but the passenger became disruptive again mid-flight, refusing to wear the mask and claiming to be ""drinking"" to avoid it. The FAs allowed this for about 30 minutes, but the passenger did not drink. When the passenger continued to be non-compliant, the FAs repeatedly asked her to wear the mask, prompting the captain to request a customer service representative and security. The passenger eventually screamed and flipped off the FAs, leading the captain to message dispatch again and request security. Despite the passenger's disruptive behavior, no emergency was declared. The flight continued to its destination, and upon landing, security and a customer service representative were present. The passenger was removed from the aircraft by the customer service representative. The FAs did not suspect the passenger was intoxicated but believed she was disturbed.

The flight attendant was informed by another crew member about the passenger, who had pre-boarded and requested that her seat be cleaned with Clorox after deplaning. Upon speaking with the passenger, the flight attendant learned that the individual had a contagious illness, which could be transmitted through contact but was not airborne. Despite the turbulence and being on final descent, the flight attendant contacted the cockpit, informing them of the situation. The cockpit, occupied by the captain, was unable to communicate at that time but was advised to have a supervisor meet the plane at the gate. The passenger was not in distress and did not require immediate medical attention, so the flight attendant did not call for emergency services. Upon landing, chaos erupted at the gate. Operations staff opened the door, allowing the flight attendant to deplane, but then locked the jet bridge, preventing other passengers from exiting. The captain attempted to enter the jet bridge, and the flight attendant was forced to open the door for him. The flight attendant was instructed to make an announcement asking passengers to remain on the plane, while supervisors gathered to collect information and inform the parents of an unaccompanied minor (UM) about potential exposure. The flight attendant worked to prevent the UM and other passengers in the affected row from deplaning, as requested by supervisors. Once cleared, passengers, including the UM, were allowed to exit, with the flight attendant collecting the ill passenger's information. After everyone had deplaned, the flight attendant assisted the ill passenger off the aircraft, cleaned the affected row with onboard disinfectant, and continued her duties, including coordinating with the inflight supervisor, the captain, and the outbound crew. The incident highlighted a breakdown in communication post-landing, as the captain did not contact the cabin crew to clarify the situation, leading to confusion and the subsequent lockdown. The flight attendant expressed frustration with the lack of communication and the resulting delays, suggesting that a coordinated approach could have been achieved if the captain had communicated with the cabin crew after landing.

Maintenance responded by stating that the pilot could provide a code for alternative access, but during a briefing with the Captain, it was clarified that no such alternative access was available under emergency conditions. Uncomfortable with the safety risk, the Flight Attendant contacted the crew desk to report their concerns. As a result, the Flight Attendant was charged with a ""Did Not Fly"" action, leading to a delay in the aircraft. The Flight Attendant expressed hope that the safety issue would be addressed administratively to prevent similar situations in the future. In summary, the incident was caused by the inoperative keypad entry system, which raised safety concerns.

850257,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",crew-related issues
