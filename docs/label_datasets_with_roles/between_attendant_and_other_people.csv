1797439,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"A conflict occurred between a flight attendant (Party 1) and ground personnel (Party 2) during the disembarkation process of a flight at ZZZ airport. The incident arose due to a ""quick-turn"" operation, where the cleaning crew boarded the aircraft before all passengers had disembarked. This led to confusion as passengers, cleaning staff, and crew members were moving through the cabin simultaneously. The flight attendant was unaware of the situation escalating, as she was focused on her usual duties, including calling rows to deplane and ensuring passenger safety. During the process, she noticed the cleaning crew slipping onboard in casual attire, which blended them in with passengers and crew. Pilots were also leaving the aircraft, adding to the chaos. The flight attendant assumed all passengers had disembarked after seeing the last passenger, who resembled a cleaner, and stepped off the plane. However, a male passenger had remained onboard, intermixed with the cleaning crew and crew members. He was eventually found after his boarding pass was located under his seat. Contributing factors included the quick turnaround procedure, the lack of distinction in clothing between cleaning staff and other individuals onboard, and the presence of multiple ground staff and crew members in the jet-bridge and cabin. The flight attendant noted that double-checking passengers and crew for proper identification could help prevent such confusion in the future. She also expressed concerns about passengers removing or lowering their masks, which could further complicate the deplaning process. As a result of the incident, the flight attendant planned to alert corporate security to the situation and the potential for similar confusion during future disembarkations.",between attendant and other people

Passengers, traveling from ZZZ to ZZZ1, boarded an aircraft with the bags through the aft door. The flight attendant indicated the bags were too large for the overhead bins. The passengers claimed they were permitted to carry them onboard. Efforts to accommodate them were made, but the gate agent insisted the bags be checked due to safety regulations. As a result, the passengers were deplaned with their bags. The flight attendant noted the passengers had been on a previous flight but didn't observe them boarding with the bags earlier. No solution was proposed during the incident.",between attendant and other people
1848975,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident occurred at ZZZ International Airport when a flight attendant instructed the cabin crew to prepare the doors for arrival. While the flight attendant was at the door, they noticed the gate agent and attempted to open the flap. However, the main handle unexpectedly lifted, causing the flight attendant to jerk back. The flight attendant did not signal the gate agent with a thumbs-up or disarm the R1 door. The gate agent continued to pull the door, causing the slide to deploy. The flight attendant promptly informed the first officer (FO) and the captain about the incident. The B flight attendant attempted to console the affected flight attendant and advised them to take pictures and file an incident report. The deployment of the slide resulted in an investigation and documentation of the event.",between attendant and other people
1751692,Flight Attendant,Other,"During a flight, a **Flight Attendant (FA)** reported an incident involving a passenger, referred to as Passenger X, who exhibited unusual behavior. Passenger X used the restroom a total of **nine times** within a span of **1.5 to 2 hours**, which raised concerns among the crew and other passengers. Upon entering the restroom, Passenger X was heard coughing heavily, to the point of gagging, which worried two other passengers. When asked about his condition, he initially claimed it was due to allergies but later stated he was not feeling well because he had not eaten breakfast. The FA provided snack bags to all passengers and kept a close eye on Passenger X throughout the flight. Additionally, Passenger X was repeatedly reminded to wear his mask properly. The FA noted that he was reading or digging through his bags, which may have contributed to the need for mask reminders. The FA informed the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) about the situation, and the PIC requested that the FA check if there was a way to take Passenger X's temperature. Since the crew did not have a thermometer, the PIC suggested contacting a customer service agent to meet the flight. After landing, the PIC instructed the FA to ask Passenger X to remain seated until all other passengers had deplaned, so that someone could speak with him privately. Passenger X complied but was visibly unhappy and removed his mask in frustration. After noticing the FA's surprise, he quickly put the mask back on. Passenger X was the last to deplane and was met by a customer service agent at the gate. The FA later reported that Passenger X had used the forward restroom immediately after boarding the plane, adding to the total of nine restroom visits. His behavior created disturbances and safety concerns during the flight.",between attendant and other people
1754883,Flight Attendant,Other,"During a flight, a passenger (Passenger X) assigned to seat XX3 refused to comply with the face mask policy despite being granted a special exemption to remove the mask for brief intervals. The incident began when the flight attendant noticed Passenger X without a mask during boarding. The Gate Agent, who had not briefed the flight crew on any exemptions, initially denied knowing about one. Passenger X presented a boarding pass with an ink-written exemption and a letter stating his disability. Despite the Gate Agent's initial approval, the flight attendant insisted on consulting the Captain, who confirmed that an exemption was needed specifically for the flight. The Gate Agent then retrieved a record confirming the exemption, allowing Passenger X to remove the mask for short periods. However, during the 2.5-hour flight, Passenger X repeatedly ignored the mask policy, often only covering his chin instead of his nose and mouth. Compounding the issue, Passenger X's disruptive two-year-old child coughed and sneezed throughout the flight, and Passenger X cited anxiety as a reason for non-compliance. Despite the exemption, Passenger X showed total disregard for the mask rules, requiring multiple reminders from the flight crew. An exemption was granted for Passenger X to remove the mask for specified intervals. However, Passenger X failed to adhere to the exemption, leading to repeated reminders and non-compliance during the flight.",between attendant and other people
1756195,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a CRJ-200 aircraft experiencing difficulty in cooling its cabin before departure. The captain reported that the aircraft had been parked on the ground for over 10 hours in high temperatures, with the cabin temperature reaching 38°C (101°F). The captain made multiple requests to ground personnel to connect external cooling systems, but these were delayed. Despite starting the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and opening overhead gaspers to circulate air, the cabin remained warm. Approximately 30 minutes after the captain initially requested external air, a ramp agent connected the external cooling system. At the scheduled boarding time, the cabin temperature had decreased to 36°C (96.8°F), and the flight attendant felt comfortable boarding. The flight departed on time, but the flight attendant later expressed discomfort due to the high cabin temperature, which she believed impaired her ability to focus on her duties. The incident highlighted the challenges of cooling aircraft parked for extended periods in high temperatures and the need for improved communication and response protocols between flight crews and ground personnel to address such issues promptly. The captain suggested that a system should be in place to ensure external cooling is connected well in advance of departure, particularly for aircraft like the CRJ-200, which are more susceptible to heat-related comfort issues.",between attendant and other people
1760111,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident occurred at ZZZ, where a conflict arose between a flight attendant and ground personnel (cleaners). The flight attendant reported that cleaners entered the aircraft prematurely, before passengers had fully deplaned, disrupting the deplaning process and compromising social distancing measures. The flight attendant instructed the cleaners to wait until passengers had disembarked, but they refused, citing adherence to their protocol. During the exchange, a cleaner removed his mask, prompting further concern. The flight attendant emphasized that the cleaners' actions were unnecessary given the ample ground time (one and a half hours) available. The flight attendant suggested that cleaners should wait for passengers to deplane and maintain their masks when interacting with crew.",between attendant and other people
1760736,Flight Attendant,Other,"During a pre-takeoff safety check, the flight attendant (Party1) noticed a child seat positioned directly behind the exit row. While conducting her duties, she was occupied with greeting passengers and ensuring that those seated in the exit row were willing to assume the responsibilities of that seat. A passenger in the exit row exhibited hearing difficulties, as she was unable to respond to the flight attendant's instructions. The passenger explained that her ears were blocked due to a prior landing, leading to congestion but not indicating that she was sick. The flight attendant attempted to reseat the passenger in accordance with safety protocols, but a gentleman seated nearby objected, claiming the passenger was sick and should not be on the plane. The passenger denied being sick, though her congestion raised concerns about potential COVID-19 symptoms. The flight attendant consulted with the captain and operations, who advised her that if the passenger was not explicitly sick or exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, she could remain on the plane. The flight attendant proceeded with reseating the passenger and securing the forward cabin. The incident was resolved after the flight attendant successfully completed the seat change and informed the captain that the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure. The flight attendant did not hear a public address (PA) confirming the aft cabin was secure but ultimately ensured the situation was managed.",between attendant and other people
1657011,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a miscommunication during the final boarding procedures of an A319-100 flight, where the entry door was closed by ground personnel without the consent of the Number 1 Flight Attendant. The pilot, unable to visually confirm who was requesting clearance due to a busy cockpit, assumed it was the Flight Attendant and granted permission. However, it was later discovered that the ground agent had closed the door, violating company policy, which mandates that the Flight Attendant must authorize such actions. During the post-flight debrief, it was determined that the ground personnel were at fault for not coordinating with the Flight Attendant. The crew acknowledged the challenge pilots face in confirming identities in a crowded cockpit. To prevent future occurrences, it was agreed that ground personnel should be trained to follow proper procedures and wait for the Flight Attendant's authorization before closing the door. Additionally, pilots were encouraged to make every effort to confirm the identity of the person requesting clearance, highlighting the importance of clear communication protocols. This incident underscores the need for enhanced training and communication to ensure adherence to company policies, emphasizing the crucial role of the Flight Attendant in such procedures.",between attendant and other people
1578218,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and ground personnel during aircraft operations. The flight attendant reported being sent messages about a reassignment to an empty airplane and subsequent flights. While preparing for departure, the flight attendant communicated with a ground agent who lacked necessary equipment (headset and wing-walkers) and experience in towing the aircraft from the location. After resolving this initial issue with the help of maintenance, the flight attendant proceeded to ZZZ, landing just after midnight. Upon landing and taxiing to the gate, the flight attendant encountered a near-accident when an airport bus failed to yield, nearly driving in front of the aircraft. The flight attendant had to apply brakes abruptly to avoid collision. Despite communication with ground personnel and the tower, the bus driver did not comply, creating a safety hazard. The aircraft was eventually positioned at the gate, but the ground agent left the jetway unattended, requiring a 15-minute wait for assistance to avoid triggering security alarms. The flight attendant recommended that ground personnel, particularly bus drivers, be informed to yield to aircraft to prevent similar incidents.",between attendant and other people
1602741,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party 1) and ground personnel (Party 2) regarding two passengers boarding a B737-800 aircraft with dogs that were not properly documented or restrained. During boarding, the flight attendant observed a passenger in seat 8C with a pet in a carry-on kennel and another passenger in seat 25A with a small dog under her coat. The first dog remained in the kennel for the entire flight without causing disruptions, but the passenger had to swap seats due to the kennel being blocked by an IFE power box under seat 8C. The second dog, later identified as an emotional support animal (ESA), was not documented as such on the passenger's manifest or special services list. Although the passenger was checked in, there was no reference to the ESA or service animal (SVAN) on the flight attendant's tablet or the special services list. The flight attendant notified the gate agent about the undocumented ESA and observed a customer service representative boarding the aircraft to inquire about the animal. After the flight, it was discovered that the passenger's PNR had been updated to reflect the dog as a SVAN, but the animal was not properly restrained, as required by safety protocols, and lacked any visible identification or control gear. The flight attendant expressed concern over the lack of proper documentation and restraint, which posed a safety risk to passengers and crew. The report was filed to address the safety risk associated with the un restrained animal and the failure to properly document the ESA. The flight attendant recommended improving communication and compliance with documentation and restraint requirements to prevent similar incidents in the future.",between attendant and other people
1505311,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and ground personnel (Party2) during aircraft operations. The flight attendant opened the 1L door of a 737 aircraft in the armed position after receiving a thumbs-up signal from the station agent. This caused the slide pack to dislodge and partially deploy. The flight attendant immediately grabbed the door to prevent further deployment, instructed the agent to step back, and informed the captain. The captain assumed control, ensuring passenger safety, communicating the situation to passengers, and coordinating with maintenance. The slide pack was eventually removed, and passengers were safely deplaned. The incident was attributed to the flight attendant's failure to follow proper disarm procedures, including the monitor and challenge protocol, due to physical and mental fatigue, discomfort, and distractions from prior incidents during the day. The flight attendant acknowledged the lapse in focus and expressed intent to adhere strictly to procedures in the future. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further complications.",between attendant and other people
1425749,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident involved a visually impaired passenger with a service dog on a sold-out flight. The flight attendant requested the passenger to move to a window seat to prevent obstruction of aisle access, as per company policies. The passenger refused, citing his rights, leading to a prolonged delay as the crew and supervisors attempted to resolve the issue. The situation escalated when the police were threatened with being called, though they didn't arrive. Eventually, other passengers persuaded the man to move, allowing the flight to proceed. The passenger remained agitated but compliant. Post-landing, he caused a scene, prompting leadership to direct him to contact customer service. The flight attendant suggested that the ACAA could aid in educating passengers to prevent such conflicts, emphasizing the need for consistent enforcement of safety regulations.",between attendant and other people
1431017,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident arose from a miscount of passengers during the boarding process, resulting in an unaccounted extra passenger on board. The flight experienced a 50-minute gate hold after boarding was complete. Despite periodic passenger announcements, the pushback was delayed due to unprepared staff and missing pushback crew. At pushback, the flight attendant provided an illegible passenger count, leading the captain to assume the count was correct. Takeoff was approved, and the cabin was notified. Shortly after taking the runway, the flight attendant reported a passenger concerned about being on the wrong aircraft. The captain instructed everyone to remain seated and planned to address the issue in flight. Upon reaching 10,000 feet, the load sheet showed 46 passengers, while the flight attendant's count was 47. The discrepancy revealed an extra passenger, a connecting passenger who had not exited at the previous stop, found in the lavatory during the count. The crew coordinated with dispatch to have a customer service agent meet the passenger at the destination. The flight had to divert to resolve the issue, causing delays and operational challenges. The extra passenger was offloaded, and the aircraft was prepared for the next leg. The captain suggested revising the passenger counting procedure, possibly conducting counts earlier or more thoroughly to prevent such errors, noting that other airlines may handle this process differently. This incident highlights the importance of accurate passenger counting and the potential benefits of revising current procedures to minimize errors.",between attendant and other people
1453483,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a discrepancy in the passenger manifest for an A320 flight. During the boarding process, the ground personnel noticed that the manifest reported 90 passengers, but the actual number of passengers on the aircraft was 127, a difference of over 30 people. The ground personnel raised concerns with the flight attendant, emphasizing the need to resolve the issue before departure. A head count was conducted at the suggestion of another flight attendant, confirming the discrepancy. The ground personnel then informed the gate agent about the mismatch and suggested implementing a standardized head count procedure for all flights at the airport to prevent similar issues in the future. The resolution process took approximately one hour, and the flight eventually departed after the discrepancy was addressed.",between attendant and other people
1324189,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident occurred between a flight attendant (Party1) and ground personnel (Party2) during the boarding process of a flight with 127 passengers. The flight attendant was assisting a non-English speaking woman with an infant and needed to find two adjacent seats for the family. Despite making multiple announcements requesting volunteers to move, the flight attendant faced difficulties in securing the cabin. During this time, the ground personnel (OPS agent) repeatedly closed the forward entry door before the cabin was fully secured, disregarding the flight attendant's instructions to wait until all passengers were seated and bags stowed. The OPS agent dismissed the flight attendant's concerns and even shooed her away, causing the door to nearly hit her. The flight attendant reported the incident to the captain, who then summoned a Ground Operations Supervisor. The OPS agent claimed the door closed due to wind, but the flight attendant and another crew member disputed this, stating the door was manually closed. The situation was ultimately resolved with the supervisor's intervention.",between attendant and other people
1347344,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved an unintended breach of cockpit security on a B767 flight. During the flight, a crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit due to a misunderstanding. The relief First Officer (FO) requested the Flight Attendant to inform the child to look out for a view of Greenland. The Flight Attendant misinterpreted this as an invitation for the child to enter the cockpit. Consequently, the child entered the cockpit, followed by the Flight Attendant. Upon realizing the oversight, the FO secured the cockpit and ensured the child and Flight Attendant were promptly escorted out. The situation was resolved without further complications. The Captain later addressed the Flight Attendant, emphasizing the importance of adhering to security protocols and clarifying instructions to prevent such incidents in the future. The Flight Attendant was reminded to refuse or clarify ambiguous requests regarding cockpit access to ensure passenger and crew safety.",between attendant and other people
1349723,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a flight attendant initiating a ground medical call that was poorly executed due to inadequate training. The attendant failed to communicate effectively, providing unnecessary details and incorrectly referring to a medical responder as a doctor.

The result was a ineffective communication that wasted time and could have been critical in an emergency. The solution proposed is enhanced training for flight attendants in medical communication and procedures.",between attendant and other people
1388303,Flight Attendant,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred during a flight when a passenger in seat 12B, diagnosed with lung cancer, used a personal oxygen bottle not listed on the manifest. The flight attendant, initially unaware, was informed by the passenger's girlfriend that TSA had permitted the bottle. Upon realizing the bottle's presence, the flight attendant retrieved an onboard portable oxygen bottle, instructed the passenger to turn off his personal device, and notified the cockpit. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of verifying oxygen device usage and being vigilant during boarding to prevent similar occurrences. The result was the passenger switching to the provided onboard bottle.",between attendant and other people
1265117,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Purser) and ground personnel (Customer Service agent) regarding the disclosure of information about a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) and a Federal Air Marshal (FAM) on board a flight. The Purser, while boarding First Class passengers, encountered the LEO and later a FAM, both of whom required specific seating arrangements. The Purser sought to verify their credentials and seating locations but was informed by the Customer Service agent that such information could compromise security and was only available on the final paperwork. The Purser expressed frustration over the lack of advance communication, as this information is typically provided upon check-in. The Customer Service agent maintained that revealing the details would breach security protocols. No solution was explicitly proposed in the context, but the Purser emphasized the importance of timely information for crew safety and management.",between attendant and other people
1288887,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"An incident occurred on an EMB175 flight involving a flight attendant and ground personnel. The flight attendant completed the passenger count and handed it to the pilots. A gate agent approached them with two boarding passes: one for an upgrade request (YYD) and another for a passenger (XXD) with an interrupted travel itinerary, noting that XXD might have been intoxicated. The flight attendant upgraded YYD and monitored XXD, who appeared fine during the flight. Upon landing, passenger XXC informed the flight attendant that XXD had urinated in the seat during landing. The captain was alerted, and hazmat was called to clean the area. The flight attendants avoided the affected seats and notified the incoming crew. The flight attendant expressed concern about the gate agent's handling of the situation, stating that the crew was only informed just before the cabin door closed, leaving them unprepared. The primary issue was the lack of timely communication from the ground staff. The flight attendant suggested that ground personnel should inform the crew about such situations as soon as possible to ensure preparedness.",between attendant and other people
1309194,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident began when a flight attendant (Party1) noticed a passenger (Party2) with a small backpack on his lap during the final cabin walk-through. The attendant asked the passenger to stow the backpack in the overhead bin, as it was considered carry-on luggage. The passenger became defensive, refusing to comply and stating that no one had ever asked him to do so. The situation escalated when the passenger opened the backpack and began removing items, despite the attendant's instructions to secure the items but not the backpack itself. The passenger continued to disregard the attendant's directives. Later, during taxiing, the passenger was observed using a phone, which drew the attention of another passenger who questioned whether it was permitted. The attendant tapped the passenger on the shoe to address the issue, asking if he was in airplane mode. The passenger loudly confirmed but became confrontational, telling the attendant to stop touching him. The passenger seated behind him then intervened, asking the disruptive passenger to follow instructions. The father of the disruptive passenger intervened, claiming the son was using an app that was not on the internet. The attendant decided to switch cabin sections to avoid further conflict, delegating the area to another flight attendant (Party1's colleague). This action aimed to de-escalate the situation and prevent further disruption. The flight attendant believed she handled the situation appropriately and did not feel she had made any errors. The disruptive passenger remained non-compliant and unresponsive to instructions. The incident was resolved without further escalation, as the attendant successfully transferred responsibility for the area to a colleague. The flight attendant's decision to switch cabin sections and transfer responsibility to another crew member was the proposed solution to avoid further conflict.",between attendant and other people
1320591,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a flight where a strong chemical odor, described as resembling spoiled eggs and vomit, was detected shortly after takeoff. This odor led to physiological symptoms such as headaches and vision issues among the flight attendants and passengers. The flight was subsequently turned around and returned to the departure airport. Upon landing, the crew experienced delays in receiving medical attention, as the initial medical provider was unable to conduct necessary blood tests promptly. The ground personnel indicated that the odor may have originated from the left engine, which had been cleaned the night before but not run long enough to eliminate fumes, as per protocol. The flight attendant suggested improved protocols for carbon monoxide testing and against maintenance shortcuts, while the ground personnel emphasized the need for specific procedures and criticized the delayed medical response. The medical tests conducted hours later were inconclusive due to the delay.",between attendant and other people
1193711,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant on a B737-700 flight identified a passenger using a flameless military ration heater (FRH). The flight attendant confiscated the item, secured it by placing it in double bags, and stored it in the wheelchair compartment for the remainder of the flight. Upon landing, the flight attendant informed the Captain about the confiscation and the need to notify Ground Security but forgot to hand over the FRH due to being occupied with assisting an unaccompanied minor and managing crew changes. The FRH was not delivered to Ground Personnel after the flight, resulting in the item not being properly handed over. To prevent such occurrences, it is recommended that flight attendants implement a more rigorous handover procedure, such as setting reminders or ensuring a structured process for transferring items to Ground Personnel, especially when faced with multiple duties post-landing.",between attendant and other people
1199064,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred during the pre-departure phase of a flight, involving the Flight Crew and ground personnel. The Flight Crew encountered issues with the ACARS system, which was deferred, and the inoperative printer. Despite initial normal functionality during setup, they received conflicting messages about a maintenance release and aircraft readiness. Before addressing this, they had to handle concerns from the flight attendants regarding an armed passenger, a dog onboard, and a verbal conflict with a gate agent over overhead bin space. After resolving these issues, the crew pushed back and started engines, only to realize they lacked a maintenance release. Maintenance attempted to send the release digitally but failed, opting instead to deliver a hard copy via the cockpit window. The flight crew proceeded safely with the hard copy. The incident was caused by communication system failures and conflicts, leading to the delayed acquisition of necessary documentation, but the flight continued without further issues.",between attendant and other people
1242903,Ground Personnel,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred after a flight crew arrived at the gate in DEN when a caterer opened an armed door without authorization, with the red tape still across the viewport, causing the slide pack to deploy onto the deck of a catering truck.

Upon reaching Juliette and turning right, they stopped before crossing Runway 11 and received a call from Ground Control regarding a possible deviation. Ground Control provided a phone number and later cleared the crew to cross Runway 11 and proceed to Runway 4R. Upon reaching the holding short area, the Tower informed the crew that they had crossed Runway 4L without clearance. The flight attendant stated that the crew had intended to follow the taxi clearance as understood, which they believed included crossing intervening runways. The flight attendant attributed the misunderstanding to the taxi clearance instructions, which they claimed were ambiguous and different from the usual format (""Taxi Runway 4R via Bravo and hold short Runway 4L""). The first officer reportedly misapplied the instructions, leading to the unintended crossing of Runway 4L. The crew ultimately followed the corrected instructions and resolved the situation without further incident.",between attendant and other people
1042669,Ground Personnel,Party1 Flight Crew,"An incident occurred when multiple armed federal agents boarded a flight without prior notification to the crew, resulting in confusion and a delayed departure. The agents included an FAA Inspector, FBI agent, DEA agent, and two Air Marshals. The boarding process began without consulting the flight attendants, who were unprepared, causing a delay as passengers were held on the jet bridge. Communication issues led to the flight attendant being unaware of all law enforcement personnel initially. After an FBI agent and DEA agent arrived, the flight attendant sought a supervisor, who apologized and resolved the confusion by informing all agents of each other's presence. The flight departed 13 minutes late, with the FAA Inspector initiating an investigation.",between attendant and other people
967088,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant misunderstood an order to arm the doors, leading to an emergency exit slide being deployed at the gate by a caterer. The Flight Attendant believed they had heard the Lead Flight Attendant instruct to ""prepare doors"" and proceeded to check the cabin. Upon reaching the forward galley, they discovered the front entry door and cockpit doors were open. A caterer approached and explained that they had intentionally opened the forward entry door, mistaking the orange safety strap for a signal to deploy the slide due to sunglass glare. The slide was fully deployed and facing upward, creating an obstruction. The Flight Attendant, along with the caterer and gate agent, secured the slide, moved the aircraft to another gate, and coordinated with ground staff to bring a replacement aircraft. Passengers were deplaned, and the flight resumed less than 50 minutes after the initial delay. No injuries were reported, and the situation was handled efficiently. The Flight Attendant acknowledged the importance of double-checking procedures and expressed gratitude for the positive outcome. The caterer was unharmed but was advised against such actions in the future.",between attendant and other people
967487,ATC,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved an autopilot malfunction during the departure of a PC12 aircraft from TEB, leading to a track deviation. The autopilot failed to stop at the correct heading, prompting the captain to disconnect it. Subsequently, the crew received ATC instructions to expedite climb and turn right direct to BREZY. However, the crew incorrectly read back the instructions as ""cleared direct to BREZY,"" which ATC later acknowledged was their mistake due to workload and miscommunication. Contributing factors included the controller's busy frequency, the autopilot's aural warning causing headset noise, and the FMS and autopilot's incorrect handling of the SID. As a result, the captain decided to hand-fly the SID in the future, distrusting the FMS and autopilot. ATC was advised to avoid accepting incorrect readbacks during critical phases of flight.",between attendant and other people
915316,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"The incident began when a flight attendant discovered a silver item resembling a Palm Pilot in a seatback pocket. It was handed to another attendant, who proceeded to the cockpit. The captain decided to reopen the door to transfer the item to security. Upon opening the door, the flight attendant handed the item to the security agent, who immediately examined and opened it, surprising the attendants. A gate agent, unimpressed, dismissed the item as a simple Palm Pilot and made a risk assessment, claiming it didn't look like a bomb. This comment distressed the attendants, as nearby passengers could hear the exchange. They expressed their concerns to the gate agent, urging caution and adherence to security protocols. The attendant informed the captain, who spoke with the gate agent. Meanwhile, another attendant kept the FAMs informed. Later, the flight attendants discussed their concerns with the FAM team leader, highlighting the gate agent's lack of concern and the mishandling of the situation, which conflicted with their training.

948689,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"An incident occurred at a Q400 aircraft when passengers began deplaning through the aft door without the right engine being shut down, due to insufficient communication and awareness among the flight crew, ground personnel, and cabin crew. Upon arrival, the seatbelt signs were off, but the door chime was not received. The Ramp Agent opened the aft door, prompting the Flight Attendant to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots had shut down engine #1 but left engine #2 running, awaiting ground power unit connection. The flight attendant, unaware of the running engine, permitted deplaning. Another flight attendant noticed the engine still running and shut it down after passengers had started leaving. Passengers deplaned while engine #2 was running, posing a safety risk. Post-incident, all parties agreed on the need for enhanced communication and awareness. Improve communication and coordination among flight, ground, and cabin crew. Ground personnel should act as the eyes and ears for the flight crew. Cabin crew should enhance their observational skills and not solely rely on ground crew information. This incident highlights the importance of clear communication and situational awareness to prevent similar occurrences.",between attendant and other people
951620,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident was triggered by the ground personnel closing the aircraft door prematurely, without the flight attendant's authorization. This occurred while passengers were still boarding and overhead bins were open, leading to subsequent safety protocol violations. The flight attendant attempted to address the situation but faced further issues during pushback. The cockpit door remained open, and the captain had two observers on board without informing the flight crew. The attendant had to make an urgent announcement but did not receive a proper response, affecting the safety briefing and takeoff preparations. Upon arrival, it was discovered that the cockpit doors were not armed during pushback, indicating a clear safety hazard. The incident highlighted multiple failures in adhering to Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) and company Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The flight attendant had to debrief a new hire about the mishandled procedures, emphasizing the importance of compliance with safety protocols. To prevent recurrence, it was suggested that ground personnel should not close the door without explicit approval from the flight attendant. Additionally, the aircraft should not move on the ground until the cockpit door is securely closed and the entry door is properly armed. The captain should verify with the lead flight attendant before initiating any door closures, ensuring all safety measures are in place.",between attendant and other people
838902,Flight Crew,Party1 Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred at ZSPD when a young boy with a temperature of 38.7°C was quarantined, along with his row and six flight attendants who had served him. Biohazard personnel, led by a station manager, enforced these measures. The manager initially stated that only one flight attendant could depart, causing a conflict with the flight crew. The crew refused to select someone for quarantine, leading the manager to decide. The purser volunteered to stay, despite not being in contact with the boy. The Captain questioned why a customer service agent couldn't accompany the quarantined individuals, but the manager didn't respond. A safety concern arose as a healthy crew member was sent to a hotel with sick individuals, provided only with purification tablets and tap water. The purser's decision to stay and the Captain's suggestion for customer service involvement highlighted the need for improved quarantine protocols.",between attendant and other people
839745,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident occurred after a B757 flight arrived at the gate. The flight attendant disarmed door 2R and proceeded to door 2L, where he attempted to open the door without disarming it. Upon realizing his mistake, he tried to disarm the door, but a ground agent outside the door began resisting the flight attendant's efforts to close and disarm the door. As a result, the slide pack fell onto the cabin floor but did not inflate. The captain was unaware of the situation initially, as no one notified him, and he only became aware when he went to door 2L. Company personnel were summoned to manage the situation, and passengers were instructed to stand clear while maintenance removed the slide pack to a safe location and assisted with deplaning. The incident was resolved without further issues.",between attendant and other people
841451,Flight Attendant,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred on an oversold flight where a passenger of size caused seating issues. The flight attendant attempted to address the problem by switching seats and informing customer service agents, but they did not proactively resolve the situation, leading to the armrest remaining up throughout the flight. This resulted in safety concerns and a congested aisle. The attendant felt unsupported and guilted by the customer service team, despite the company's policy to prevent such situations.",between attendant and other people
850257,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",between attendant and other people
