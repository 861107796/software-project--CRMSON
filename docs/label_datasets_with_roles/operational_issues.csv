2102491,Flight Attendant,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved an off-duty Flight Attendant (Party1) who attempted to assist during a safety procedure on a flight. The aircraft experienced an issue with the landing gear, prompting the captain to conduct a preparation for land evacuation demonstration. During this time, Party1, who was in uniform and seated in the cabin, volunteered to assist by taking on the role of FA #8 at the jump seat in the aft galley. However, the Purser (Party2) denied this offer, instructing Party1 to return to their seat in the cabin, stating that only working Flight Attendants should be involved in the safety procedure. After landing, the off-duty Flight Attendants (deadhead crew) were reassigned to work the next departing flight, which caused significant fatigue due to being awake for approximately 27 hours. This decision was particularly challenging because the deadhead crew had less time available compared to the on-duty crew, who were subsequently released from their duties. The inconsistency in treatment and the denial of assistance led to frustration among the deadhead crew, who felt their efforts and well-being were overlooked despite being part of the same incident. A proposed solution is to ensure fair treatment and consideration for all crew members, including those deadheading, in such situations.",operational issues

Y dealt with the passenger while X closed the doors and made an announcement, with both stating the cabin was secure. However, X assumed Y would finish her duties, and Y believed X had secured the cabin. The confusion arose when the captain opened the flight deck door, expecting the cabin to be secure but was unaware of the status. Both realized their mutual assumption led to the oversight. They re-secured the cabin and resumed the briefing, causing a delay. The incident was caused by both parties' distractions and mutual assumptions, highlighting the need for clearer communication protocols to prevent such misunderstandings. Implementing a check system or specific confirmation procedure could enhance future operations.",operational issues
1797439,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"A conflict occurred between a flight attendant (Party 1) and ground personnel (Party 2) during the disembarkation process of a flight at ZZZ airport. The incident arose due to a ""quick-turn"" operation, where the cleaning crew boarded the aircraft before all passengers had disembarked. This led to confusion as passengers, cleaning staff, and crew members were moving through the cabin simultaneously. The flight attendant was unaware of the situation escalating, as she was focused on her usual duties, including calling rows to deplane and ensuring passenger safety. During the process, she noticed the cleaning crew slipping onboard in casual attire, which blended them in with passengers and crew. Pilots were also leaving the aircraft, adding to the chaos. The flight attendant assumed all passengers had disembarked after seeing the last passenger, who resembled a cleaner, and stepped off the plane. However, a male passenger had remained onboard, intermixed with the cleaning crew and crew members. He was eventually found after his boarding pass was located under his seat. Contributing factors included the quick turnaround procedure, the lack of distinction in clothing between cleaning staff and other individuals onboard, and the presence of multiple ground staff and crew members in the jet-bridge and cabin. The flight attendant noted that double-checking passengers and crew for proper identification could help prevent such confusion in the future.

As the flight attendant greeted passengers and distributed wipes, they noticed Passenger X boarding the aircraft with a mask that barely covered their nose or mouth, along with their family. The flight attendant politely requested that Passenger X and their family ensure their masks were properly worn. Initially, the family complied, but after the pilots announced the departure, Passenger X removed their mask entirely. Passengers nearby appeared uncomfortable, and Passenger X seemed to be deliberately testing the flight attendant's response. Despite dim lighting in the cabin, the flight attendant could see Passenger X and gestured for them to reapply their mask. Passenger X ignored this gesture. When the flight reached 10,000 feet, the flight attendant approached Passenger X and kindly reminded them to wear their mask properly. Passenger X complied briefly but removed their mask again as the flight attendant walked away. When informed of the face mask policy announcements, Passenger X did not comply and argued with the flight attendant, questioning why they were being targeted. The flight attendant then informed the pilots, who advised giving one final reminder. After three gentle reminders, Passenger X, their spouse, and their children finally complied with the mask policy. The incident was resolved without further issues, and the flight attendant ensured compliance with the face mask policy throughout the remainder of the flight.",operational issues

The flight attendant was informed by another crew member about the passenger, who had pre-boarded and requested that her seat be cleaned with Clorox after deplaning. Upon speaking with the passenger, the flight attendant learned that the individual had a contagious illness, which could be transmitted through contact but was not airborne. Despite the turbulence and being on final descent, the flight attendant contacted the cockpit, informing them of the situation. The cockpit, occupied by the captain, was unable to communicate at that time but was advised to have a supervisor meet the plane at the gate. The passenger was not in distress and did not require immediate medical attention, so the flight attendant did not call for emergency services. Upon landing, chaos erupted at the gate. Operations staff opened the door, allowing the flight attendant to deplane, but then locked the jet bridge, preventing other passengers from exiting. The captain attempted to enter the jet bridge, and the flight attendant was forced to open the door for him. The flight attendant was instructed to make an announcement asking passengers to remain on the plane, while supervisors gathered to collect information and inform the parents of an unaccompanied minor (UM) about potential exposure. The flight attendant worked to prevent the UM and other passengers in the affected row from deplaning, as requested by supervisors. Once cleared, passengers, including the UM, were allowed to exit, with the flight attendant collecting the ill passenger's information. After everyone had deplaned, the flight attendant assisted the ill passenger off the aircraft, cleaned the affected row with onboard disinfectant, and continued her duties, including coordinating with the inflight supervisor, the captain, and the outbound crew. The incident highlighted a breakdown in communication post-landing, as the captain did not contact the cabin crew to clarify the situation, leading to confusion and the subsequent lockdown. The flight attendant expressed frustration with the lack of communication and the resulting delays, suggesting that a coordinated approach could have been achieved if the captain had communicated with the cabin crew after landing.

1565089,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and a Flight Captain regarding the operation of a flight with an inoperative interphone system. The Flight Attendant reported that the interphone system, which is a critical communication link between the flight deck and cabin, was not functioning. According to the aircraft manual, the aircraft should not depart if the interphone system is inoperative. However, the Captain insisted that the flight could proceed by opening the flight deck door during takeoff and landing as an alternative protocol. The Flight Attendant expressed discomfort with this approach, as it contradicted the manual, but was reportedly pressured and guilted by the Captain into complying with the protocol for four consecutive flights. The incident highlights issues within the company, including overloading its fleet and crew capacity, aircraft disrepair, and a culture where those who raise concerns about safety are punished, while those who operate flights illegally are rewarded financially. The Flight Attendant had previously raised concerns with multiple senior management personnel, including the Director of Operations, who acknowledged the potential safety risk but did not take definitive action to prevent the flight. The Captain, known for maximizing his flying hours and earnings, was not held accountable for his protocol, despite the risks involved. In summary, the incident reflects systemic management and safety concerns within the organization, including disregard for safety protocols, crew well-being, and regulatory compliance. A potential solution proposed was to review the manual's requirements, assess the Captain's flight hours, and investigate the interphone system's compliance with the MEL (Minimum Equipment List).",operational issues

The crew elected not to shut down the engine, as the vibration was not severe enough, and successfully landed at ZZZ. Post-landing, the crew learned that a flight attendant had noticed a louder engine noise, which the crew had not detected. The crew identified multiple issues with the contract maintenance, including a prior incorrect engine repair and a lack of thorough inspection. The maintenance team's unprofessional conduct and inability to competently inspect the engine led the crew to cancel the flight from ZZZ. The crew recommended against using the contract maintenance provider and criticized Maintenance Control for its disengagement and lack of problem-solving support. The flight was ultimately diverted and canceled due to these maintenance and communication shortcomings.",operational issues
847367,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant who reported concerns regarding a safety issue related to cockpit access. The Flight Attendant noticed a maintenance defect on the keypad entry system to the cockpit, which was inoperative and rendered the cockpit door inaccessible from the cabin side. This raised safety concerns, as the Flight Attendant would be unable to access the cockpit in an emergency. The Flight Attendant informed the purser about their concerns, who then contacted maintenance. Maintenance responded by stating that the pilot could provide a code for alternative access, but during a briefing with the Captain, it was clarified that no such alternative access was available under emergency conditions. Uncomfortable with the safety risk, the Flight Attendant contacted the crew desk to report their concerns. As a result, the Flight Attendant was charged with a ""Did Not Fly"" action, leading to a delay in the aircraft. The Flight Attendant expressed hope that the safety issue would be addressed administratively to prevent similar situations in the future. In summary, the incident was caused by the inoperative keypad entry system, which raised safety concerns. The process involved the Flight Attendant reporting the issue, maintenance being contacted, and the Captain confirming the lack of emergency access. The result was a ""Did Not Fly"" action and aircraft delay, with the Flight Attendant advocating for future administrative corrections to address the safety concern.",operational issues
850248,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred during the pre-flight procedures of a DHC-8 aircraft. The Captain requested permission to start the number one engine after completing the weight and balance paperwork. However, the passenger door warning light was unreadable due to sunlight reflecting on the panel, and the Captain did not notice the door was open. The Flight Attendant noticed the door was open and knocked on the flight deck door to alert the crew. The Captain immediately shut down the engine. The Gate Agent, who had earlier removed and stowed the prop tie, returned to the aircraft and collected the paperwork, allowing the door to be properly closed. The engine was restarted, and the remainder of the flight proceeded without further issues. The incident was attributed to an environmental factor (sunlight) and the absence of ground personnel monitoring the door after collecting the paperwork.",operational issues
850257,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",operational issues
853596,Flight Attendant,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved two flight attendants on a B747-400 aircraft who both assumed their responsibilities for arming the emergency exit doors were covered by the other. During predeparture preparations, one flight attendant was focused on cleaning and securing the galley, while the other was assisting with passenger seating and safety checks. Neither ensured the doors were armed, leading to the aircraft taking off with both upper deck doors disarmed. Upon realizing the mistake, they armed the doors, informed the cockpit, and completed the flight safely. The flight attendant later reflected on the need for clearer communication and task allocation to prevent such oversights in the future.",operational issues
854519,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and cabin crew on a B767-300 aircraft, primarily centered on a breakdown in communication and respect for the Captain's authority. The issue escalated when the Purser, a senior cabin crew member, refused to comply with the Captain's orders, leading to a decision by the Captain and First Officers to request the removal of the Purser from the flight. This decision was met with resistance from other flight attendants, who expressed concerns about the Captain's safety if the Purser was removed. After a conference call with the Flight Operations Manager, it was agreed that the Purser would fly as a passenger on the remainder of the journey rather than continue in his role. The remaining flight attendants maintained their stance that they could not work safely under the Captain's authority if the Purser was removed. The flight resumed without further issues, with the second Purser taking over duties. No safety compromise occurred during the incident, but the Captain expressed concerns about the cabin crew's ability to work effectively in an emergency.",operational issues
856199,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding the inoperative cockpit/cabin interphone system on an MD80 aircraft. The flight attendant reported that the interphone system was non-functional during the flight, as she could only hear a clicking sound and could not communicate properly with the cockpit. Despite her concerns, the captain stated that the destination did not have maintenance and that the flight could proceed. The flight attendant later discovered in the manual that the aircraft should not be dispatched if all interphone systems were inoperative. She raised this issue with the captain upon deplaning, emphasizing the risk to both the crew and passengers. The flight was operated with the interphone system inoperative, and no issues arose on the return journey. The attendant expressed frustration over the decision to proceed despite the risk, highlighting the potential dangers of such a situation.",operational issues
861872,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and the flight attendant during the takeoff preparation process. The flight crew reported that the taxi out from the gate to Runway 30R was shorter than expected, and the flight attendant was believed to have had sufficient time to complete her pre-takeoff announcements. However, the flight crew did not inform the flight attendant that the taxi out was short. While taxing to the runway, the flight crew was cleared into position and hold before completing the before-takeoff checklist. The First Officer requested an additional 10 seconds, but the Tower instructed the aircraft to hold short. The aircraft was unable to stop before its nose crossed the hold short line by approximately 5 feet. The Tower then instructed the flight attendant to read back the hold short instructions, and the flight attendant indicated she was ready for takeoff, believing she had completed her announcements. The Tower subsequently cleared an inbound flight to go around due to the aircraft's position. After confirming the flight attendant was ready, the flight crew was cleared for takeoff, and the flight proceeded without further incident. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and coordination between the flight crew and the flight attendant to prevent similar occurrences.",operational issues
863815,Flight Attendant,Party1 Flight Crew,"The incident involved a B737-700 flight where an incorrect passenger count led to an overweight takeoff. The ground personnel provided a loadsheet stating 51 passengers, but the actual count was 81. The flight attendants did not verify the count and relied on the loadsheet. During the climb, the discrepancy was noticed, prompting the crew to adjust the zero fuel weight. However, the loadsheet had been revised three times without proper communication. The overweight takeoff posed a safety risk, and the crew later adjusted the weight. The flight supervisor emphasized the importance of accurate passenger counts to crosscheck loadsheet data, highlighting the need for better communication and verification processes.",operational issues
864862,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"A flight attendant on a CRJ900 aircraft became incapacitated due to food poisoning, which manifested with symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, and severe cramps. Despite initial attempts to continue her duties, her condition deteriorated, leading her to inform the captain she could not perform her responsibilities. The captain, referencing company procedures (FOM), coordinated with a passenger who was an EMT to monitor her condition and take appropriate actions. The flight landed safely, with the EMT assisting in securing the cabin and moving the flight attendant to a passenger seat. Upon deplaning, she was evaluated by EMTs and later at an airport clinic, diagnosed with food poisoning, and advised against flying. The incident highlighted the importance of early communication with crew scheduling and seeking timely medical assistance.",operational issues
