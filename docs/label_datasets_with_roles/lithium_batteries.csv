2172923,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred on a flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1, involving a passenger (Party2) and a flight attendant (Party1). The cause was the passenger's refusal to check her bag for an international trip, leading to a confrontation. The process began with the passenger insisting her bag fit in the overhead compartment, which the flight attendant redirected to the front attendant. When the passenger was denied, she became upset, yelled at the flight attendant, and filled out a complaint form during the flight. The result was the passenger opening multiple overhead bins and taking photos, prompting the flight attendant to secure the galley and notify the captain. The captain was informed about both this misconduct and a separate issue involving a passenger's bag with lithium batteries. The proposed solution involved notifying the captain to handle these issues through appropriate channels.",lithium batteries
2182306,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant and Ground Personnel, with the Flight Attendant being required to check their flight bag due to lithium batteries. The cause was attributed to poor training among the Ground Personnel, leading to the forced surrender of lithium-ion batteries and their placement in the cargo hold. Despite the Flight Attendant's attempt to explain that they were within carry-on limits and that the bag contained necessary manuals, the situation remained unresolved. The summary highlights the conflict arising from regulatory enforcement and the resulting actions taken by the Ground Personnel.",lithium batteries
1949120,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred during a flight when a flight attendant received a report from the captain of an unusual odor in the cabin. The flight attendant made an announcement requesting passengers to report any vaping activity or unusual behavior. During her investigation, she noticed Passenger A had a device under her coat that was emitting a sweet odor. Despite the flight attendant's request to hand over the device, Passenger A refused. The flight attendant confiscated the device and isolated it in the galley to identify the source of the odor. After the flight, Passenger A demanded the return of the device and verbally confronted the flight attendant. The flight attendant maintained professionalism and reported the incident to the captain. As a result, Passenger A was banned from the airline. The flight attendant concluded her actions as necessary for cabin safety.",lithium batteries
1819490,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"A conflict occurred between a flight attendant and ground personnel concerning a passenger's carry-on smart bags with non-removable batteries. Passengers, traveling from ZZZ to ZZZ1, boarded an aircraft with the bags through the aft door. The flight attendant indicated the bags were too large for the overhead bins. The passengers claimed they were permitted to carry them onboard. Efforts to accommodate them were made, but the gate agent insisted the bags be checked due to safety regulations. As a result, the passengers were deplaned with their bags. The flight attendant noted the passengers had been on a previous flight but didn't observe them boarding with the bags earlier. No solution was proposed during the incident.",lithium batteries
1770089,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"The incident involved a disagreement between a flight attendant (FA) and the flight crew regarding the admissibility of a passenger's hoverboard as carry-on or checked baggage. The passenger had a hoverboard in a box that was initially unnoticed during boarding but was observed during taxi-out. The FA reported this to the Captain, who permitted it if the lithium battery was under 50 grams, citing their manual. However, the FA referenced their manual, which prohibited PMDs (Personal Mobility Devices) as carry-on or checked baggage. The manual was found to have conflicting sections: one prohibiting PMDs and another allowing them with battery limitations, which were unclear regarding exact gram limits. The flight crew believed their manual permitted the hoverboard's battery. To resolve the issue, they proposed aligning FA and flight crew manuals to avoid confusion, adding boarding pass notifications for bulkhead passengers to brief at the gate, and enhancing the FA manual's specificity on PMD definitions under hazardous materials. The key cause was manual discrepancies, with proposed solutions to improve clarity and procedures.",lithium batteries
1718343,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"During a B737-900 flight, a Flight Attendant discovered a large hard-covered box in the overhead bin, which a passenger identified as a drum set containing a lithium battery. The attendant expressed concerns about the item's size, its inability to fit into a battery containment bag, and the presence of lithium batteries, particularly since the flight was scheduled to operate over water for five hours. The attendant sought clarification from the Customer Service Representative (CSR) and the Captain regarding the item's approval but did not receive satisfactory answers. The Captain acknowledged the presence of other lithium battery-powered devices on board, such as cell phones and laptops, but deemed the drum set acceptable. The attendant raised questions about the lack of thorough research into the item and proposed that such items should be checked more carefully before departure. The incident highlights concerns about lithium battery safety and the need for proper review procedures.",lithium batteries
1610542,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between a flight attendant (FA) and ground personnel regarding the transport of a battery-powered Segway by a passenger. The passenger had boarded the aircraft using the Segway, which the FA perceived as a hoverboard. The FA questioned the Operations Agent (Ops Agent) about the type of battery in the device, as it was unclear and potentially concerning for safety reasons. The Ops Agent stated that TSA had approved the device and that it had been tagged as checked baggage. However, the Ops Agent did not confirm the type of battery or communicate this information to the flight deck crew and cabin staff, leaving the crew uncertain about the safety of the device in the cargo hold. The flight attendant attempted to verify the device's classification in the manual but found no relevant information. The incident concluded with the device loaded in the cargo hold, and the crew remained unsure about its safety. The FA expressed concerns about a potential safety violation or a failure in communication. No specific solution was proposed in the context.",lithium batteries
