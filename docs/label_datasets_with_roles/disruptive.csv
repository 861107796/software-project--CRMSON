During the final approach, Mr. X unbuckled his seatbelt, stood in the aisle, and displayed erratic behavior, including attempting to grab an infant from a nearby passenger, which alarmed other passengers. The process of the incident involved the FA repeatedly attempting to assist Mr. X in complying with safety protocols. However, Mr. X became combative, grabbing a female passenger's wrist and yelling at the FA. As the aircraft approached the runway, the FA and another FA stationed in the back worked to protect Mr. X from potential injury during landing by positioning themselves strategically. Once the aircraft landed and taxied to the gate, the FAs ensured Mr. X remained in the cabin and prevented him from accessing the exit doors while they were armed. The FAs remained with Mr. X until the aircraft was secured at the gate. The result of the incident was the successful containment of Mr. X and the protection of other passengers and crew until the situation was resolved safely. No physical harm was reported, and the FAs effectively managed the situation.",disruptive
1152312,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred during the approach to landing when a passenger entered the lavatory, lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke alarm and message panel. The Flight Attendant requested the passenger return to her seat, but she refused. The Captain addressed the passenger via a public announcement, prompting her to exit the lavatory, where she cursed and claimed to have used feminine hygiene spray. The Flight Attendant discovered the spray but no cigarettes, suggesting the passenger's defiance indicated guilt. The smoke alarm disrupted cockpit communication during a critical phase. The passenger was detained by police but not arrested. The Flight Attendant believes FAA regulations should be enforced against her for smoking in the lavatory and non-compliance.",disruptive
989901,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred during the deplaning process of a flight. A passenger in her twenties attempted to exit the aircraft by turning right near the forward bulkhead, deviating from the standard leftward exit path used by other passengers. The flight attendant noticed this and repeatedly instructed the passenger to turn around and exit the correct way. Despite the attendant's intervention, the passenger continued to the provisioning truck, realized her mistake, reboarded the aircraft, and exited through the proper left-side door. The passenger did not engage in communication with the flight attendant or any crew members. The flight attendant reflected on the challenges faced during deplaning, particularly the limited space and the presence of multiple individuals (crew, provisioners, and agents) in the galley area. She suggested the possibility of implementing a temporary boundary to prevent such incidents, though she acknowledged the potential safety concerns associated with this idea.",disruptive
943675,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"The incident occurred during an ILS 4R approach into BOS when a Flight Attendant contacted the cockpit about a disruptive passenger. The call was unexpected as the crew was in the sterile cockpit phase. The passenger was refusing to turn off his phone, prompting the Flight Attendant to seek assistance. The crew decided to address the issue by making a PA announcement, continuing the approach, and landing safely. Post-landing, they requested security to handle the passenger. The crew later reflected that answering the call during sterile cockpit may have been unnecessary, leading to a decision to improve communication protocols to avoid similar distractions in the future.",disruptive
946632,Maintenance,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred when a maintenance crew member requested that boarding be delayed to complete a maintenance procedure in the E&E compartment of a B767-300ER aircraft. Despite this request, boarding commenced. During the process, a passenger fell through the floor access to the E&E compartment, resulting in minor injuries and temporary disorientation. The maintenance crew member had instructed everyone to stay away from the area, but the boarding proceeded regardless. After the fall, the passenger was able to stand and exit the compartment unassisted, with no serious harm reported.",disruptive
839745,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident occurred after a B757 flight arrived at the gate. The flight attendant disarmed door 2R and proceeded to door 2L, where he attempted to open the door without disarming it. Upon realizing his mistake, he tried to disarm the door, but a ground agent outside the door began resisting the flight attendant's efforts to close and disarm the door. As a result, the slide pack fell onto the cabin floor but did not inflate. The captain was unaware of the situation initially, as no one notified him, and he only became aware when he went to door 2L. Company personnel were summoned to manage the situation, and passengers were instructed to stand clear while maintenance removed the slide pack to a safe location and assisted with deplaning. The incident was resolved without further issues.",disruptive
