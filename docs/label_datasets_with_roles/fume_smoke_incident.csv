1918721,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved an A321 flight crew (Party 1) and a flight attendant (Party 2). During the flight, the crew noticed an abnormally high aft cargo bay temperature (194 degrees), which was above standard operating parameters. The crew consulted manuals and contacted maintenance but found no immediate solution. Concerned about the situation, particularly over water with limited diversion options, the crew decided to divert to ZZZ2. They made a PAN PAN call to inform ATC and contacted dispatch. During descent and landing at ZZZ2, the crew encountered challenges with overweight landing conditions and ATC communication, but the landing was uneventful. Post-landing, maintenance informed the crew that a fume report had been filed by the flight attendants, though the crew had no prior knowledge of fumes or related issues during the flight. Maintenance deferred the APU to prevent further fume events. The crew expressed concerns about the lack of communication from the flight attendants regarding the suspected fume event and questioned the adequacy of maintenance's response. They recommended improved communication protocols between the cockpit and cabin crew, better access to quick reference materials for such situations, and a more thorough investigation of potential issues instead of deferred fixes.",fume/smoke incident
1789902,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"An A319 flight encountered a fume/smoke event during its arrival taxi to the gate. The incident began when the fourth flight attendant (FA4) detected an odor and reported smoke, suspecting it might be electrical. The flight crew, led by the captain, halted the aircraft and assessed the situation. The captain noticed a brief whiff of something, while the first officer detected nothing. They contacted ground control and requested the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) team. The flight crew considered their checklist for smoke/fumes but sought more information. Upon contacting the cabin, FA1 reported no smoke or odor, while FA2 noted a dissipating odor and a light haze in the reading lights. The captain, after consulting with the first officer, decided to proceed to the gate for ARFF evaluation. The aircraft landed smoothly, and passengers deplaned normally. The event highlighted the challenges of communication among cabin crew in a darkened cabin. The suggested improvement was enhanced communication to ensure a more informed and coordinated response, allowing for a clearer assessment and more efficient information transfer to the flight deck. The incident underscores the importance of effective communication among cabin crew to enhance incident handling and preparedness.",fume/smoke incident
1750764,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"During the climbout from ZZZ after takeoff at 2,500 feet MSL, the flight crew noticed a significant decrease in airflow through the flight deck vents. The Captain adjusted the temperature selectors to full cold due to the extremely hot and humid conditions at ZZZ. Both the Captain and the First Officer (FO) believed the air conditioning systems had iced up based on prior experience. The FO then increased the temperature settings to attempt to melt any ice, and airflow returned to normal shortly afterward. At the same time, the flight deck received an interphone call from Flight Attendant 1 (FA1), who reported that hot air was flowing into the cabin and that it smelled like ""dirty socks."" The FO assured FA1 that the temperature would be adjusted and instructed her to call back if the issue persisted. The airflow and temperature in both the flight deck and cabin subsequently returned to normal, and the flight continued to its destination, ZZZ1, without further incident. Following the flight, the Captain discovered evidence of a bird strike on the right engine during the post-flight walk-around, including feathers embedded in the bypass fan blades and core compressor blades. During the ride to the hotel, other flight attendants (FA2, FA3, and FA4) reported that they had called FA1 during the initial climbout and detected smells resembling ""burnt chicken,"" ""cooked chicken,"" or a ""burnt bird strike"" odor. However, FA1 only described the smell as ""dirty socks"" when contacting the flight deck. The Captain emphasized that had he been aware of the more specific descriptions provided by the other flight attendants, his decision to continue to ZZZ1 might have been different, as the smells could have indicated a more serious issue such as engine damage or failure. The Captain highlighted the importance of clear and accurate communication among all crew members. He suggested that flight attendants should relay specific and precise observations to the flight deck to ensure that potential issues are fully understood and addressed. This could prevent more serious consequences, such as engine failure or other safety risks.",fume/smoke incident
1754089,Flight Attendant,Other,"A flight attendant encountered a passenger who repeatedly failed to comply with mask-wearing regulations and other cabin behavior guidelines. The passenger, identified as X, was reminded multiple times before takeoff to stow her belongings and wear her mask. During the flight, Passenger X disregarded these instructions, lying across seats and removing her mask. She also engaged in painting her toenails, despite being asked to stop due to fumes bothering others. When addressed, Passenger X became confrontational, raising her voice and refusing to comply. The flight attendant and crew, including the Chief Attendant, took steps to mitigate the situation, offering alternative seating to affected passengers. Passenger X eventually complied with mask requirements for the remainder of the flight but quickly left the aircraft upon landing. The flight attendant emphasized that such behavior should not be tolerated, prioritizing the comfort and safety of all passengers and crew.",fume/smoke incident
1668050,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident began with a briefing where the Captain expressed concerns about past First Officers challenging his authority, which the First Officer found unusual. Disagreements arose regarding procedures, such as requesting a new TPS in flight, leading to growing tension. During the return leg, smoke from the oven, caused by burning dinner rolls, prompted the Captain to divert to ZZZ2. Despite the First Officer's consideration of continuing, the Captain, under stress, opted for an overweight inspection and refused to proceed further. This resulted in a delay, with passengers disembarking and the aircraft being parked for the night.",fume/smoke incident
1608882,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident involved a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight, leading to a conflict with the flight attendants. The flight attendants noticed a strong smell of marijuana when the passenger exited the aft lavatory and observed smoke inside the lavatory. The passenger appeared paranoid and initially lied to the police about his actions. The flight attendants called the captain, and upon landing, police were summoned. During questioning, the passenger denied using marijuana but later admitted to smoking in the cabin and lavatory after a vape pen, which tested positive for THC, was found in his possession. The passenger was detained, and the flight attendants reported the incident to the authorities. The flight attendant experienced throat irritation and a headache, possibly due to the effects of THC exposure. The police confirmed the vape pen contained THC, leading to the passenger's confession and detention.",fume/smoke incident
1516706,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a B737 flight crew responding to smoke in the aft lavatory, which was traced to a passenger's electronic cigarette. Upon notification, the smoke alarm activated, causing cabin chaos. The captain, departing from standard protocol, left the flight deck to personally assess the situation, concluding no immediate fire hazard existed. After extinguishing the alarm and inspecting the lavatory, the captain instructed the flight attendants to lock the lavatory and monitor the situation. Despite the First Officer's departure from standard procedure by opening the flight deck door, the captain returned and decided to continue the flight to the destination. Later, the flight attendants found the electronic cigarette, confirming its role in the incident. The captain's actions prioritized safety, aligning with company policies.",fume/smoke incident
1412286,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred during the cruise phase of a B737-800 flight about 45 minutes prior to landing at ZZZ. The First Officer (FO) required a physiological break and temporarily left the cockpit to use the forward lavatory. A flight attendant (FA) entered the cockpit in accordance with standard procedures, closing the door behind them. During the FO's absence, a Hispanic passenger approached the forward galley. The FA instructed the passenger to either use one of the rear lavatories or return to her seat, as she was not permitted to remain in the galley. The passenger, who did not understand English, was initially uncooperative. However, the three FAs, who spoke fluent Spanish, repeatedly explained the situation. Despite this, the passenger refused to comply, verbally abused, and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA was called to assist. The 'A' FA informed the Captain via interphone, who heard loud voices and ongoing dialogue between the FAs and the passenger in Spanish. The FO, having exited the lavatory, joined the situation in the galley. After several minutes, the passenger's husband intervened and persuaded her to return to her seat. With the passenger seated and the FAs, including the male deadheading FA, positioned to block access to the forward galley and cockpit door, the cockpit door was opened. The FA exited the cockpit, and the FO returned. The cockpit was then secured in accordance with Threat Level 1 protocols. Upon arrival at ZZZ, law enforcement was summoned to remove the passenger from the aircraft. The Captain, after consulting with the FO and visually confirming the galley's security, determined it was safer for the FO to remain in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. The incident highlighted the need for recurrent security training, particularly addressing scenarios where the cockpit is locked down with one pilot in the cabin. The discussion raised questions about the safest seating arrangement for an FA in such situations—whether in the jumpseat or a pilot seat.",fume/smoke incident
1441841,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred during the arrival into [destination] when smoke was reported in the cabin due to an e-cigarette battery experiencing thermal runaway. The flight crew donned oxygen masks, communicated with the flight deck team, and requested a direct approach to [destination]. The flight attendants successfully contained the device and its spare batteries in an ion battery emergency containment bag, resolving the smoke issue. Despite the situation being controlled, the flight crew remained on oxygen throughout the approach and landing. Upon landing, the flight crew was surrounded by Fire Rescue, surprising the flight attendants who had been making announcements. The incident highlighted a communication lapse, with the captain failing to follow up with the flight attendants after initially notifying them of the oxygen use. The captain acknowledged the need for better resource management and delegation, recognizing that shared responsibilities could have mitigated the distractions and improved communication.",fume/smoke incident
1270787,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred after a flight arrived at Airport ZZZ and completed its parking checklist. Upon opening the L1 door, the flight crew and forward flight attendants detected a faint fuel smell, which they initially attributed to external factors such as a neighboring aircraft being fueled, the APU running, and gusty northwest winds. The flight attendants requested the cockpit to make a passenger address (PA) to reassure passengers, which was done. However, there was a misunderstanding regarding the status of the aircraft doors and exits. Passengers, believing there was an emergency, opened the over wing exits and began exiting onto the wings without authorization. Despite efforts by the flight attendants to stop the uncommanded evacuation, several passengers exited before being directed back into the aircraft. The fuel smell intensified, leading the flight crew to shut off the APU and air conditioning systems, which reduced the odor and condensation. A ground staff member informed the cockpit of a fuel leak near the APU, prompting the crew to secure the aircraft, shut down the APU, and request ARFF (Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting) support as a precaution. Maintenance personnel inspected the APU and identified a fuel leak. The crew secured the aircraft, performed the necessary checks, and documented the issue in the maintenance logbook. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further incident. The cause of the fuel odor was later identified as a fuel leak from the APU, which was addressed by maintenance.",fume/smoke incident
1279697,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident involved a passenger who smoked an e-cigarette in the aft lavatory during the climb at 12,000 feet, triggering the ECAM warning and the smoke detector. The flight attendants promptly addressed the situation by informing the passenger, leading to the alarm being resolved. The crew notified dispatch, who arranged for a Ground Security Coordinator to meet them at the destination. The passenger was unaware that e-cigarettes are prohibited on board, highlighting the need to include this information in the passenger briefing.",fume/smoke incident
1320591,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a flight where a strong chemical odor, described as resembling spoiled eggs and vomit, was detected shortly after takeoff. This odor led to physiological symptoms such as headaches and vision issues among the flight attendants and passengers. The flight was subsequently turned around and returned to the departure airport. Upon landing, the crew experienced delays in receiving medical attention, as the initial medical provider was unable to conduct necessary blood tests promptly. The ground personnel indicated that the odor may have originated from the left engine, which had been cleaned the night before but not run long enough to eliminate fumes, as per protocol. The flight attendant suggested improved protocols for carbon monoxide testing and against maintenance shortcuts, while the ground personnel emphasized the need for specific procedures and criticized the delayed medical response. The medical tests conducted hours later were inconclusive due to the delay.",fume/smoke incident
1193958,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred on an A319 aircraft when a male passenger smoked a cigarette in the lavatory, despite the presence of a smoke detector. Flight Attendant B noticed the odor, confronted the passenger, and discovered a smoldering cigarette inside a beer can. She extinguished the cigarette by submerging the can in water and notified the other flight attendant and the captain. Flight Attendant A made a subsequent no-smoking announcement, and the passenger was required to provide his ID and return to his seat. The flight attendant reported the incident to the FAA, and the passenger was informed that the incident would be documented. The smoke detector did not activate, highlighting a potential issue with the system.",fume/smoke incident
1152312,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred during the approach to landing when a passenger entered the lavatory, lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke alarm and message panel. The Flight Attendant requested the passenger return to her seat, but she refused. The Captain addressed the passenger via a public announcement, prompting her to exit the lavatory, where she cursed and claimed to have used feminine hygiene spray. The Flight Attendant discovered the spray but no cigarettes, suggesting the passenger's defiance indicated guilt. The smoke alarm disrupted cockpit communication during a critical phase. The passenger was detained by police but not arrested. The Flight Attendant believes FAA regulations should be enforced against her for smoking in the lavatory and non-compliance.",fume/smoke incident
1163132,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a flight attendant who experienced illness after exposure to cleaning chemicals with strong fumes used by ground personnel. The flight attendant encountered the odor during preflight and when emptying trash, leading to dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, dry heaves, and vomiting. Despite measures like drinking water and resting, symptoms persisted, prompting notifications to the domicile, supervisor, and union. The union noted previous attempts to halt the practice, and the flight attendant remained off work two weeks later. A proposed solution was to cease using cleaner in the oven.",fume/smoke incident
1058785,Flight Attendant,Maintenance,"The incident involved a First Officer who reported that the Left-Hand (LH) Chip Detector Light was illuminated during the preflight inspection of their CRJ-200 aircraft. After discussing the issue with the Captain, they decided to divert to ZZZ1 due to concerns about potential delays at the outstation. Upon arrival, Maintenance discovered sufficient debris in the chip detector, leading to the aircraft being removed from service for oil system flushing and reinspection. Contributors to the incident included the lack of clear guidelines for flight crew regarding the chip detector light, which is not part of the standard preflight inspection. The First Officer noted that the light frequently illuminated during the first flight of the day at outstations, and the difficulty of obtaining timely Maintenance support at remote locations compounded the decision to delay reporting. This was the second occurrence in two months, with the first five instances requiring only a simple cleaning of the detector. To prevent future occurrences, the First Officer recommended the establishment of clear guidelines for flight crew actions when the chip detector light is illuminated, aiming to address confusion and reduce the risk of similar incidents.",fume/smoke incident
1114668,Maintenance,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved an MD-82 aircraft that diverted to ZZZ2 due to the illumination of the Battery Charger light after takeoff. A Flight Attendant reported water coming from the overhead area, prompting an investigation. Circuit breakers L5, X25, Z24, and the Ground Service Bus were found inoperative, though other electrical systems functioned normally. The Line Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT) addressed the issue by replacing the Battery Charger per the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM), resetting the circuit breakers, and conducting operational checks, which were normal. The AMT did not document checking the overhead panels, floors, or E/E compartment for water in the logbook's Action Taken block, as no evidence of water intrusion was found. The AMT believed the water was likely due to condensation from rain and humidity the previous night. Despite this, the AMT emphasized that the logbook's Discrepancy block should not be assumed to require no action in the Action Taken block. The aircraft was cleared for service following the maintenance.",fume/smoke incident
921495,Maintenance,Maintenance,"The incident involved a B737-500 aircraft experiencing uncontrollable high temperatures in the cabin during cruise altitude. The issue arose due to a maintenance error when replacing the temperature controller. The replacement was not properly tested, resulting in the temperature controllers being cross-wired. This caused the left pack to run at full heat, leading to a duct overheat and a strong smell in the cabin. The crew donned oxygen masks and followed smoke/fumes checklists to resolve the situation, after which normal air quality was restored, and the flight continued to its destination. The proposed solution is to conduct a functional test of the system controller before signing off on such maintenance tasks to prevent similar incidents.",fume/smoke incident
928902,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"In a recent incident involving a B777 aircraft, a flight attendant detected a puff of smoke emanating from a reading light in the lower lobe crew rest area. Upon noticing this, the attendant discharged a halon fire extinguisher on the light fixture and promptly informed the cockpit. The captain acknowledged the situation and requested the attendant to turn off the light, though she was unable to do so. There were no alarms triggered in either the crew rest area or the cockpit, and subsequent investigation by the purser confirmed that the issue had been resolved. As a precaution, all flight attendants evacuated the lower lobe crew rest area. The captain then contacted maintenance, who recommended removing the faulty bulb. This was executed without complications. Maintenance logged a report regarding the incident, including the halon discharge. Both maintenance and dispatch concurred with the captain's decision to proceed to the planned destination. Throughout the remainder of the flight, flight attendants monitored the area, reporting no further issues. Upon arrival, contract mechanics inspected the area but found no abnormalities, attributing the small smoke emission to a likely faulty bulb.",fume/smoke incident
841929,Flight Crew,Other,"The incident occurred when an A319 aircraft experienced the automatic deployment of oxygen masks in the front cabin section due to toxic fumes and haze. The Lead Flight Attendant, showing excitement and respiratory distress, informed the crew. In response, the Flight Crew declared an emergency with Air Traffic Control (ATC) and diverted to the nearest suitable airport, completing the descent in approximately 6-7 minutes. Post-landing, the fumes dissipated, and the air cleared. The crew taxied to the gate, deplaned, and informed their company of their situation.",fume/smoke incident
