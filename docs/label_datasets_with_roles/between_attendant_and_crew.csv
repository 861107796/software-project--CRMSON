Operations staff opened the door, allowing the flight attendant to deplane, but then locked the jet bridge, preventing other passengers from exiting. The captain attempted to enter the jet bridge, and the flight attendant was forced to open the door for him. The flight attendant was instructed to make an announcement asking passengers to remain on the plane, while supervisors gathered to collect information and inform the parents of an unaccompanied minor (UM) about potential exposure. The flight attendant worked to prevent the UM and other passengers in the affected row from deplaning, as requested by supervisors. Once cleared, passengers, including the UM, were allowed to exit, with the flight attendant collecting the ill passenger's information. After everyone had deplaned, the flight attendant assisted the ill passenger off the aircraft, cleaned the affected row with onboard disinfectant, and continued her duties, including coordinating with the inflight supervisor, the captain, and the outbound crew. The incident highlighted a breakdown in communication post-landing, as the captain did not contact the cabin crew to clarify the situation, leading to confusion and the subsequent lockdown. The flight attendant expressed frustration with the lack of communication and the resulting delays, suggesting that a coordinated approach could have been achieved if the captain had communicated with the cabin crew after landing. The proposed solution was for the captain to contact the cabin crew post-landing to avoid the lockdown and develop a unified plan. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of clear communication and collaboration among all crew members, regardless of their role.",between attendant and crew
1668050,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident began with a briefing where the Captain expressed concerns about past First Officers challenging his authority, which the First Officer found unusual. Disagreements arose regarding procedures, such as requesting a new TPS in flight, leading to growing tension. During the return leg, smoke from the oven, caused by burning dinner rolls, prompted the Captain to divert to ZZZ2.

The flight attendant informed the Captain, who agreed to allow the passenger to use the lavatory, giving them approximately 2-3 minutes. After the passengers entered the lavatory, the Captain decided to expedite departure, despite the flight attendant's reminder that the passengers were still inside. The aircraft took off, and around 10,000 feet, the flight attendant escorted the gentleman and toddler back to their seats. The Captain later apologized, explaining that the flight was moved up in the departure order. The flight attendant ensured the passengers' safety during the process.",between attendant and crew
1687578,Dispatch,Flight Crew,"The incident arose from a combination of poor management decisions and miscommunication within the dispatch team, leading to a highly task-saturated workload and operational breakdown. The root cause included the reduction of international desks without adjusting the workload, assigning a domestic dispatcher to an international desk during peak hours, and insufficient staffing planning. These decisions overwhelmed the remaining dispatchers, who were forced to handle an influx of calls and re-routing of flights while managing their own workload. Additionally, a flight attendant's lack of proper radio telephone protocol compounded the issue during a medical emergency, requiring the intervention of a Chief in training to assist the overwhelmed domestic dispatcher. The result was a near-disruption of operations, with the flight being diverted due to the poor planning and lack of support. The dispatcher highlighted several systemic failures, including inadequate staffing models, lack of trained leadership, and insufficient training for flight attendants. Proposed solutions included restoring proper staffing levels, having dedicated international and domestic chiefs, and improving training for both dispatchers and flight attendants to prevent similar incidents.",between attendant and crew
1687718,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident was triggered by the Captain's failure to issue the standard ""prepare for departure"" command before takeoff. Upon hearing a chime, the flight crew, including the flight attendant, assumed it might be a routine call light. Without the Captain's command, they stood in the galley during takeoff. The carts were not secured, requiring the crew to hold them in place to prevent movement. This situation posed a safety risk, as the crew was not properly positioned for takeoff, potentially hindering their ability to respond to emergencies. To prevent recurrence, it was emphasized that the Captain must consistently issue the ""prepare for departure"" command to ensure clarity and safety for the cabin crew.",between attendant and crew
1687735,Flight Attendant,Dispatch,"The incident occurred due to confusion regarding crew assignments. A flight attendant was called to assist with pre-boarding a flight to ZZZ and was informed by the gate agent that they would board as the incoming crew was delayed.

1724682,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between a flight attendant and a catering representative regarding the placement of two carrier boxes filled with dry ice in front of the boarding door. The flight attendant was not initially informed about an inoperative chiller, which the catering representative cited as the reason for leaving the boxes on the ground. The boxes posed a tripping hazard to passengers boarding the aircraft, but the catering representative refused to remove them, insisting the flight attendant take them on board. The boxes were too heavy for the crew to lift safely, and an In-Flight Supervisor present in the area was unhelpful and displayed aggressive behavior when the flight attendant attempted to resolve the issue. During the conflict, the Captain informed the crew that chiller number 7 in the aft galley had an issue, but the crew had not been previously notified. To de-escalate the situation and avoid further delays, the flight attendant decided to take the two bins of dry ice herself, carrying them onto the aircraft. This allowed the boarding door to close and the flight to depart on time.",between attendant and crew

1615868,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"The incident involves concerns raised by a flight attendant regarding the excessive use of the seat belt sign by flight deck crews, particularly captains, on multiple flights. The flight attendant reported that captains frequently left the seat belt sign on for the entire duration of flights, which ranged between 6.5 to 9.5 hours. Some captains even made pre-flight announcements about this practice. The flight attendant attempted to address this issue with the captains using CRM strategies, but the captains cited concerns about liability in case of severe turbulence and claimed they were minimizing compliance checks for flight attendants during late-night flights as reasons for their actions. The flight attendant expressed deep concern over the negative safety culture this behavior was fostering, as it encouraged passengers to ignore the seat belt sign and created complacency among flight attendants. During one flight, the flight attendant observed at least 15 passengers in the aisle while the seat belt sign was on, approximately seven hours into the flight, following breakfast service. This situation violated Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 121.311 and portions of 121.571. The flight attendant noted that this behavior occurred more frequently on long-range flights.

The Flight Attendant reported two problems during boarding: a protruding aft cargo L/H blowout panel and a broken upper track guide screw on the forward lav door. Maintenance was summoned, and a Line Mechanic noted that the blowout panel was missing three of four fasteners. A Foreman arrived and assured the Flight Attendant that the issues had been resolved, claiming a new panel had been installed and signed off. However, the Flight Attendant later discovered that the old panel had only been taped in place without the missing fasteners. The Foreman's story changed, claiming the fasteners had been found and reinstalled, but this was contradicted by the Line Mechanic, who admitted no new fasteners had been installed. The Flight Attendant raised concerns, leading to a reinspection by Maintenance, which confirmed the panel was still missing fasteners. A new panel was ordered, and passengers were deplaned and reboarded multiple times due to delays. Despite the replacement, the forward lav door again failed during the flight, with the broken screw reinstalled. Maintenance ultimately installed a new door, but it did not fit properly, causing metal-on-metal contact and difficulty in operation. The Flight Attendant expressed strong concerns about the Foreman's dishonesty and unsafe practices, which could have led to a potential accident.
