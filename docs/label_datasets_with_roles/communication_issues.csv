A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",communication issues
854519,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and cabin crew on a B767-300 aircraft, primarily centered on a breakdown in communication and respect for the Captain's authority. The issue escalated when the Purser, a senior cabin crew member, refused to comply with the Captain's orders, leading to a decision by the Captain and First Officers to request the removal of the Purser from the flight. This decision was met with resistance from other flight attendants, who expressed concerns about the Captain's safety if the Purser was removed. After a conference call with the Flight Operations Manager, it was agreed that the Purser would fly as a passenger on the remainder of the journey rather than continue in his role. The remaining flight attendants maintained their stance that they could not work safely under the Captain's authority if the Purser was removed. The flight resumed without further issues, with the second Purser taking over duties. No safety compromise occurred during the incident, but the Captain expressed concerns about the cabin crew's ability to work effectively in an emergency.",communication issues
861872,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and the flight attendant during the takeoff preparation process. The flight crew reported that the taxi out from the gate to Runway 30R was shorter than expected, and the flight attendant was believed to have had sufficient time to complete her pre-takeoff announcements. However, the flight crew did not inform the flight attendant that the taxi out was short. While taxing to the runway, the flight crew was cleared into position and hold before completing the before-takeoff checklist. The First Officer requested an additional 10 seconds, but the Tower instructed the aircraft to hold short. The aircraft was unable to stop before its nose crossed the hold short line by approximately 5 feet. The Tower then instructed the flight attendant to read back the hold short instructions, and the flight attendant indicated she was ready for takeoff, believing she had completed her announcements. The Tower subsequently cleared an inbound flight to go around due to the aircraft's position. After confirming the flight attendant was ready, the flight crew was cleared for takeoff, and the flight proceeded without further incident. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and coordination between the flight crew and the flight attendant to prevent similar occurrences.",communication issues
863815,Flight Attendant,Party1 Flight Crew,"The incident involved a B737-700 flight where an incorrect passenger count led to an overweight takeoff. The ground personnel provided a loadsheet stating 51 passengers, but the actual count was 81. The flight attendants did not verify the count and relied on the loadsheet. During the climb, the discrepancy was noticed, prompting the crew to adjust the zero fuel weight. However, the loadsheet had been revised three times without proper communication. The overweight takeoff posed a safety risk, and the crew later adjusted the weight. The flight supervisor emphasized the importance of accurate passenger counts to crosscheck loadsheet data, highlighting the need for better communication and verification processes.",communication issues
