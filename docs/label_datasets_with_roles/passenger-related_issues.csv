1790572,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"An incident occurred during a flight involving a misunderstanding between the flight attendant (Y) and the flight crew. After the doors closed, Y approached her colleague (X) to inform her of a disruptive passenger who refused to wear a mask. Y dealt with the passenger while X closed the doors and made an announcement, with both stating the cabin was secure. However, X assumed Y would finish her duties, and Y believed X had secured the cabin. The confusion arose when the captain opened the flight deck door, expecting the cabin to be secure but was unaware of the status. Both realized their mutual assumption led to the oversight. They re-secured the cabin and resumed the briefing, causing a delay. The incident was caused by both parties' distractions and mutual assumptions, highlighting the need for clearer communication protocols to prevent such misunderstandings. Implementing a check system or specific confirmation procedure could enhance future operations.",passenger-related issues
1791338,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"The incident involved a misunderstanding between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding the cabin security process. The flight attendant was distracted by a disruptive passenger who refused to wear a mask, leading to an oversight in communication. After addressing the passenger, the flight attendant assumed the flight crew had been informed that the cabin was secure. Similarly, the flight crew believed the flight attendant had communicated the cabin's readiness. This mutual assumption resulted in the cabin not being properly secured before the safety briefing began. Approximately one minute into the briefing, the captain noticed the lack of communication and informed the flight attendant, prompting both parties to re-secure the cabin promptly. The incident was attributed to the distraction caused by the disruptive passenger and the crew's assumption that the other party had handled their respective duties.

Passenger X used the restroom a total of **nine times** within a span of **1.5 to 2 hours**, which raised concerns among the crew and other passengers. Upon entering the restroom, Passenger X was heard coughing heavily, to the point of gagging, which worried two other passengers. When asked about his condition, he initially claimed it was due to allergies but later stated he was not feeling well because he had not eaten breakfast. The FA provided snack bags to all passengers and kept a close eye on Passenger X throughout the flight. Additionally, Passenger X was repeatedly reminded to wear his mask properly. The FA noted that he was reading or digging through his bags, which may have contributed to the need for mask reminders. The FA informed the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) about the situation, and the PIC requested that the FA check if there was a way to take Passenger X's temperature. Since the crew did not have a thermometer, the PIC suggested contacting a customer service agent to meet the flight. After landing, the PIC instructed the FA to ask Passenger X to remain seated until all other passengers had deplaned, so that someone could speak with him privately. Passenger X complied but was visibly unhappy and removed his mask in frustration. After noticing the FA's surprise, he quickly put the mask back on.

The two passengers exited the aircraft before the other passengers could notify the flight attendant. The flight attendant terminated the flight and informed Operations to request cleaners to sanitize the affected area thoroughly. The blood was smeared in an X shape on the wall, likely from a small wound. The flight attendant noted that without the passengers' notification, the extent of the contamination would have gone unnoticed, as the saliva and secretions had dried by the time she could inspect the area. The flight attendant reflected on the need for updated passenger announcements to emphasize the seriousness of such misconduct and the potential consequences.

1760561,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and a passenger regarding the use of face masks on board an aircraft. The passenger, who had initially boarded the flight wearing a neck/face mask, removed it during the flight and switched to a white mask with a filter valve. This mask was connected to a powered air filter that the passenger wore around their neck. The flight attendant advised the passenger that they could not use the mask with a valve or the air filter, as these were not approved for use on the aircraft. The passenger disputed this, claiming they had been told by reservations that it was acceptable. The attendant attempted to resolve the issue by showing the passenger the airline's policy on face masks, which explicitly prohibited the use of masks with valves. The passenger took a photo of the policy but continued to use the unapproved mask. During the interaction, the passenger's companion complied by switching back to their original neck/face mask, but the passenger did not. As the flight neared its end, the passenger removed the unapproved mask and switched back to their original neck/face mask before deplaning.

1765287,Flight Attendant,Other,"During a flight, a flight attendant encountered two passenger requests that led to a challenging situation. First, a passenger sought a different seat due to discomfort sitting next to someone unknown. The flight attendant attempted to find an alternative but found none available. Second, another passenger's seat would not recline, as it was located in front of an exit row. The flight attendant explained this and suggested a later flight option, as no other seats were available. While managing these requests, the flight attendant neglected to brief the exit row passengers, a crucial safety procedure. Mid-flight, she realized this oversight and promptly briefed the exit row passengers, who agreed to their seats.

Another passenger in seat YY1 similarly failed to comply with mask requirements, despite repeated requests. The flight attendant contacted the captain, who in turn reached out to a supervisor to address the situation. A passenger attempting to sit in the incorrect seat (XX2) was redirected to his assigned seat, which he complied with. However, another passenger in seat YY2 became confrontational, invading the flight attendant's personal space and expressing dissatisfaction with her approach. The flight attendant informed the passengers that those not complying with mask policies would be removed, and she summoned the captain again. Paramedics arrived and removed the passenger in seat ZZ1 from the flight. The station manager later arrived and was informed that the passengers in seats YY1 and YY2 needed to be removed for mask non-compliance and interference with crew duties.

1781086,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant (Party 1) who failed to provide a required one-on-one safety briefing to a visually impaired passenger (PAX) onboard the flight. The PAX was listed in the passenger manifest as needing a wheelchair and being blind, but the Flight Attendant was unaware of this until reviewing the manifest toward the end of the flight. This oversight occurred despite the manifest indicating the PAX's visual impairment. The Flight Attendant did not receive any communication from the gate agent or ground personnel about the PAX's condition. During the flight, standard safety briefings were conducted, but no special briefing was provided to the visually impaired passenger. Upon realizing the mistake during descent, the Flight Attendant briefly spoke with the PAX, who appeared to manage without assistance. After landing, the PAX deplaned independently, using only a simple walking cane, and declined the wheelchair assistance offered. The Flight Attendant reported the incident to the Captain, who advised filing a report due to the missed safety briefing, which is a regulatory requirement. The Flight Attendant expressed concern about the potential safety risks and acknowledged the need for improved communication and proactive verification of special assistance passengers.
