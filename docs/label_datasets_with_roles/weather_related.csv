1611412,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a taxiway incursion at EWR airport, reported by the B767 Captain. The contributing factors included poor weather conditions (icing, rain, and mist), which reduced visibility, and split radio communications between the Captain (on ground frequency) and the First Officer (on ramp frequency). During nighttime winter operations, the Captain received confusing taxi instructions from the ramp and mistakenly turned right on Taxiway R, crossing Runway 11/29. After realizing the error, the Captain set brakes, confirmed communication frequencies with the crew, and contacted Ground for clarification. Ground cleared the aircraft to continue taxiing to the gate. The crew safely reached the gate without further incident and conducted a debriefing. Contributing factors highlighted the need for improved taxiway signage in the area and better communication protocols during winter operations.",weather related
1585342,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"An incident occurred during the descent of a flight, 100 miles north of the destination, where the flight crew encountered embedded thunderstorms with zero visibility. The flight crew deviated around a small thunderstorm cell, resulting in a sudden jolt of moderate turbulence. The cabin crew, including flight attendants B and C, were in the rear galley and were injured during the turbulence, sustaining back and shoulder strains, with FA C also receiving a minor hand injury. The incident was primarily due to the captain's failure to warn the cabin crew about the impending moderate turbulence, particularly considering the increased turbulence effects in the aft section of the aircraft. The flight crew descended through solid cirrus clouds, encountering light turbulence and using weather radar. Encountered a thunderstorm cell, leading to deviation and moderate turbulence. Cabin crew, assisting an ill passenger, were injured during the turbulence. Post-incident confusion at the gate hindered immediate communication with the cabin crew. The cabin crew sustained injuries, and the captain realized the need for improved communication regarding turbulence warnings and post-incident checks. Enhance communication with the cabin crew about upcoming turbulence and use the intercom to ensure their well-being after such events. The incident highlights the importance of timely warnings and effective communication to ensure the safety and well-being of the cabin crew during turbulent conditions.",weather related
1237435,Ground Personnel,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant crew, delayed by 1 hour and 19 minutes due to weather conditions, snow, and de-icing, arrived at the gate to find that boarding had already begun for their flight without them. The ground personnel had started the process of boarding the aircraft, with approximately 10-15 passengers on board, including an unaccompanied child and crew members stowing personal luggage, despite the flight attendants not having completed their pre-flight safety checks. The flight attendants were initially mistaken for another crew due to a miscommunication. After verifying their identities and confirming that no other crew was on board, the original flight attendant crew proceeded to board the aircraft. The situation was resolved when the original crew assumed their duties, but the incident highlighted the importance of proper crew communication and pre-flight preparation to ensure passenger safety.",weather related
1241070,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a CRJ-700 flight crew and a flight attendant. The flight crew was distracted by unusual nose gear sounds during taxi-out, which they later attributed to cold weather conditions at the airport. Due to this distraction, the crew failed to complete the Before Takeoff checklist, resulting in them forgetting to inform the flight attendants of the readiness for takeoff. After climbing through 10,000 feet, the flight attendants notified the crew of the missed procedure, as one attendant had to rush back to her seat. The crew apologized, reviewed the events, and identified the missed checklist as the cause. The proposed solution was to slow down and verify all procedures after any anomaly before takeoff.",weather related
1244950,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and the Flight Crew of an ERJ-175 aircraft. The Flight Attendant reported that the cabin was not properly secured for landing due to a lack of communication from the flight deck. The flight crew was preoccupied with weather concerns and attempting to decide whether to divert to an alternate airport. Despite the Flight Attendant's repeated warnings that the cabin was not ready, the flight crew proceeded with landing. The aircraft landed safely and taxied to the gate without further incident. The captain later apologized, acknowledging that the cabin safety had been overlooked due to their preoccupation with weather conditions. The Flight Attendant suggested that the flight crew should have prioritized ensuring cabin safety by going around and delaying the landing if necessary, even if it meant diverting to the alternate airport.",weather related
1331524,Flight Attendant,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a weather-related diversion of an MD-80 flight, causing a three-hour ground delay. During the delay, flight attendants managed medical situations, including a passenger experiencing nausea and a claustrophobic episode, while also addressing passenger unrest. Despite challenges with cabin service and communication, the crew eventually re-boarded the aircraft and proceeded to the original destination, ensuring a safe arrival. The flight attendants coordinated with ground staff for hotel arrangements, concluding a taxing day with fatigue.",weather related
967088,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant misunderstood an order to arm the doors, leading to an emergency exit slide being deployed at the gate by a caterer. The Flight Attendant believed they had heard the Lead Flight Attendant instruct to ""prepare doors"" and proceeded to check the cabin. Upon reaching the forward galley, they discovered the front entry door and cockpit doors were open. A caterer approached and explained that they had intentionally opened the forward entry door, mistaking the orange safety strap for a signal to deploy the slide due to sunglass glare. The slide was fully deployed and facing upward, creating an obstruction. The Flight Attendant, along with the caterer and gate agent, secured the slide, moved the aircraft to another gate, and coordinated with ground staff to bring a replacement aircraft. Passengers were deplaned, and the flight resumed less than 50 minutes after the initial delay. No injuries were reported, and the situation was handled efficiently. The Flight Attendant acknowledged the importance of double-checking procedures and expressed gratitude for the positive outcome. The caterer was unharmed but was advised against such actions in the future.",weather related
850248,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred during the pre-flight procedures of a DHC-8 aircraft. The Captain requested permission to start the number one engine after completing the weight and balance paperwork. However, the passenger door warning light was unreadable due to sunlight reflecting on the panel, and the Captain did not notice the door was open. The Flight Attendant noticed the door was open and knocked on the flight deck door to alert the crew. The Captain immediately shut down the engine. The Gate Agent, who had earlier removed and stowed the prop tie, returned to the aircraft and collected the paperwork, allowing the door to be properly closed. The engine was restarted, and the remainder of the flight proceeded without further issues. The incident was attributed to an environmental factor (sunlight) and the absence of ground personnel monitoring the door after collecting the paperwork.",weather related
