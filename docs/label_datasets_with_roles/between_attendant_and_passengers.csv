Passenger X presented a boarding pass with an ink-written exemption and a letter stating his disability. Despite the Gate Agent's initial approval, the flight attendant insisted on consulting the Captain, who confirmed that an exemption was needed specifically for the flight. The Gate Agent then retrieved a record confirming the exemption, allowing Passenger X to remove the mask for short periods. However, during the 2.5-hour flight, Passenger X repeatedly ignored the mask policy, often only covering his chin instead of his nose and mouth. Compounding the issue, Passenger X's disruptive two-year-old child coughed and sneezed throughout the flight, and Passenger X cited anxiety as a reason for non-compliance.

The manual was found to have conflicting sections: one prohibiting PMDs and another allowing them with battery limitations, which were unclear regarding exact gram limits. The flight crew believed their manual permitted the hoverboard's battery. To resolve the issue, they proposed aligning FA and flight crew manuals to avoid confusion, adding boarding pass notifications for bulkhead passengers to brief at the gate, and enhancing the FA manual's specificity on PMD definitions under hazardous materials. The key cause was manual discrepancies, with proposed solutions to improve clarity and procedures.",between attendant and passengers

1042669,Ground Personnel,Party1 Flight Crew,"An incident occurred when multiple armed federal agents boarded a flight without prior notification to the crew, resulting in confusion and a delayed departure. The agents included an FAA Inspector, FBI agent, DEA agent, and two Air Marshals. The boarding process began without consulting the flight attendants, who were unprepared, causing a delay as passengers were held on the jet bridge. Communication issues led to the flight attendant being unaware of all law enforcement personnel initially. After an FBI agent and DEA agent arrived, the flight attendant sought a supervisor, who apologized and resolved the confusion by informing all agents of each other's presence. The flight departed 13 minutes late, with the FAA Inspector initiating an investigation.",between attendant and passengers
967088,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant misunderstood an order to arm the doors, leading to an emergency exit slide being deployed at the gate by a caterer. The Flight Attendant believed they had heard the Lead Flight Attendant instruct to ""prepare doors"" and proceeded to check the cabin. Upon reaching the forward galley, they discovered the front entry door and cockpit doors were open. A caterer approached and explained that they had intentionally opened the forward entry door, mistaking the orange safety strap for a signal to deploy the slide due to sunglass glare. The slide was fully deployed and facing upward, creating an obstruction. The Flight Attendant, along with the caterer and gate agent, secured the slide, moved the aircraft to another gate, and coordinated with ground staff to bring a replacement aircraft. Passengers were deplaned, and the flight resumed less than 50 minutes after the initial delay. No injuries were reported, and the situation was handled efficiently. The Flight Attendant acknowledged the importance of double-checking procedures and expressed gratitude for the positive outcome. The caterer was unharmed but was advised against such actions in the future.",between attendant and passengers
969330,Flight Attendant,Party1 Flight Crew,"The incident involved a flap deployment issue on a B757-200 flight, which led to a delayed landing. The captain informed the flight attendants of the problem via the public address system, describing it as a minor issue that would not affect the landing. The flight attendant relayed the information to her crew and ensured they were prepared for landing. However, the delay caused some passengers to notice fire equipment on the ground, leading to questions about the situation. One passenger raised concerns about the flaps not being down, suggesting the delay was not due to traffic. After landing, the flight attendant debriefed her crew and realized that not all crew members may have received the initial communication. To address this, she proposed implementing a new procedure requiring each crew member to acknowledge receipt of information door by door, ensuring everyone is informed in similar situations. The incident concluded safely with no further issues, and the captain and crew confirmed that the landing was uneventful.",between attendant and passengers
989901,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred during the deplaning process of a flight. A passenger in her twenties attempted to exit the aircraft by turning right near the forward bulkhead, deviating from the standard leftward exit path used by other passengers. The flight attendant noticed this and repeatedly instructed the passenger to turn around and exit the correct way. Despite the attendant's intervention, the passenger continued to the provisioning truck, realized her mistake, reboarded the aircraft, and exited through the proper left-side door. The passenger did not engage in communication with the flight attendant or any crew members. The flight attendant reflected on the challenges faced during deplaning, particularly the limited space and the presence of multiple individuals (crew, provisioners, and agents) in the galley area. She suggested the possibility of implementing a temporary boundary to prevent such incidents, though she acknowledged the potential safety concerns associated with this idea.",between attendant and passengers
946632,Maintenance,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred when a maintenance crew member requested that boarding be delayed to complete a maintenance procedure in the E&E compartment of a B767-300ER aircraft. Despite this request, boarding commenced. During the process, a passenger fell through the floor access to the E&E compartment, resulting in minor injuries and temporary disorientation. The maintenance crew member had instructed everyone to stay away from the area, but the boarding proceeded regardless. After the fall, the passenger was able to stand and exit the compartment unassisted, with no serious harm reported.",between attendant and passengers
948689,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"An incident occurred at a Q400 aircraft when passengers began deplaning through the aft door without the right engine being shut down, due to insufficient communication and awareness among the flight crew, ground personnel, and cabin crew. Upon arrival, the seatbelt signs were off, but the door chime was not received. The Ramp Agent opened the aft door, prompting the Flight Attendant to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots had shut down engine #1 but left engine #2 running, awaiting ground power unit connection. The flight attendant, unaware of the running engine, permitted deplaning. Another flight attendant noticed the engine still running and shut it down after passengers had started leaving. Passengers deplaned while engine #2 was running, posing a safety risk. Post-incident, all parties agreed on the need for enhanced communication and awareness. Improve communication and coordination among flight, ground, and cabin crew. Ground personnel should act as the eyes and ears for the flight crew. Cabin crew should enhance their observational skills and not solely rely on ground crew information. This incident highlights the importance of clear communication and situational awareness to prevent similar occurrences.",between attendant and passengers
904412,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a CRJ aircraft diverting to a nearby airport due to a female passenger experiencing a medical emergency, including vomiting and abdominal pains. The flight crew received initial reports from the cabin about the passenger's condition, followed by a request for medical assistance. The cabin crew's communication was described as panicked, with incomplete information provided during initial contacts. The flight crew prepared for the diversion, informed air traffic control (ATC), and requested emergency services at the diversion airport. The aircraft landed at ZZZ, where paramedics transported the passenger to a hospital. Following the landing, the flight crew discovered that emergency oxygen equipment had been used and was not properly serviced. The Captain expressed concern over the cabin crew's handling of the situation and their communication regarding the use of emergency equipment. Maintenance was called to service the oxygen bottle and defer the First Aid Kit, which had been used during the incident. The flight crew also reviewed the inventory of the Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit (EEMK) and found discrepancies in its contents. The flight resumed to its final destination, with no further issues reported during the remainder of the journey. The incident highlighted concerns about the cabin crew's familiarity with administrative procedures related to emergency equipment usage and their communication during critical situations.",between attendant and passengers
904583,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant discovered during the flight that a passenger in the exit row, whom she had briefed on emergency procedures, was not fluent in English. Initially, the passenger appeared to understand the briefing as she answered correctly. However, the language barrier became evident later when the passenger struggled to communicate in response to the attendant's request for drink orders. This realization of the passenger's limited English proficiency led to a communication breakdown during the flight.",between attendant and passengers
836402,Ground Personnel,Flight Attendant,"An incident occurred during a flight involving a sick passenger with the flu. After receiving pushback clearance, the Ground Personnel were informed about the passenger's condition. The passenger was visibly unwell and reported having the flu, leading to the decision to remove them from the flight. This decision was coordinated with customer service and Dispatch. Upon landing, the Flight Attendant discovered that she had failed to re-arm door 2L due to distractions caused by the passenger removal process. This oversight posed a risk in the event of an evacuation. The incident highlighted the potential consequences of not adequately screening passengers for health risks, particularly concerning contagious illnesses like influenza. A quick passenger screening process was suggested to prevent similar incidents in the future.",between attendant and passengers
843532,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred during the deplaning process at the gate, involving a flight attendant and the flight crew.

She disarmed both doors 2L and 2R as per procedure and proceeded to open the first-class closet door. During this time, a passenger opened door 2L after an agent knocked. The cause of the incident was a communication gap regarding the use of door 2L. The process involved the flight attendant disarming the doors and opening the closet, followed by the passenger opening door 2L. The result was the incident, and a proposed solution is to enhance communication and coordination among crew members to prevent similar occurrences.",between attendant and passengers
850257,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",between attendant and passengers
864862,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"A flight attendant on a CRJ900 aircraft became incapacitated due to food poisoning, which manifested with symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, and severe cramps. Despite initial attempts to continue her duties, her condition deteriorated, leading her to inform the captain she could not perform her responsibilities. The captain, referencing company procedures (FOM), coordinated with a passenger who was an EMT to monitor her condition and take appropriate actions. The flight landed safely, with the EMT assisting in securing the cabin and moving the flight attendant to a passenger seat. Upon deplaning, she was evaluated by EMTs and later at an airport clinic, diagnosed with food poisoning, and advised against flying.
