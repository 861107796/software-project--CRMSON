1895886,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"The incident involved a pressurization malfunction during a flight, which led to the aircraft landing with emergency services present. The flight attendant observed fire trucks and was informed of the issue after passengers had disembarked. The captain later explained the pressurization problem but apologized for not informing the attendant, attributing the lapse to being too occupied. The flight attendant experienced poor communication from the flight crew, resulting in unanswered passenger inquiries about the emergency vehicles. The outcome highlighted a communication breakdown between the flight attendant and the pilot crew. The captain acknowledged the issue and apologized, indicating a recognition of the communication failure but not specifying a particular resolution.",emergency
1751692,Flight Attendant,Other,"During a flight, a **Flight Attendant (FA)** reported an incident involving a passenger, referred to as Passenger X, who exhibited unusual behavior. Passenger X used the restroom a total of **nine times** within a span of **1.5 to 2 hours**, which raised concerns among the crew and other passengers. Upon entering the restroom, Passenger X was heard coughing heavily, to the point of gagging, which worried two other passengers. When asked about his condition, he initially claimed it was due to allergies but later stated he was not feeling well because he had not eaten breakfast. The FA provided snack bags to all passengers and kept a close eye on Passenger X throughout the flight. Additionally, Passenger X was repeatedly reminded to wear his mask properly. The FA noted that he was reading or digging through his bags, which may have contributed to the need for mask reminders. The FA informed the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) about the situation, and the PIC requested that the FA check if there was a way to take Passenger X's temperature. Since the crew did not have a thermometer, the PIC suggested contacting a customer service agent to meet the flight. After landing, the PIC instructed the FA to ask Passenger X to remain seated until all other passengers had deplaned, so that someone could speak with him privately. Passenger X complied but was visibly unhappy and removed his mask in frustration. After noticing the FA's surprise, he quickly put the mask back on. Passenger X was the last to deplane and was met by a customer service agent at the gate. The FA later reported that Passenger X had used the forward restroom immediately after boarding the plane, adding to the total of nine restroom visits. His behavior created disturbances and safety concerns during the flight.",emergency
1774109,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant encountered multiple passengers who refused to comply with the face mask policy on board the aircraft. The first passenger, seated in XX1, was observed with her mask below her nose and did not adhere to requests to properly cover her nose and mouth. She questioned the oxygen policy, prompting the flight attendant to inquire if she required an oxygen canister, which she did not provide. Another passenger in seat YY1 similarly failed to comply with mask requirements, despite repeated requests. The flight attendant contacted the captain, who in turn reached out to a supervisor to address the situation. A passenger attempting to sit in the incorrect seat (XX2) was redirected to his assigned seat, which he complied with. However, another passenger in seat YY2 became confrontational, invading the flight attendant's personal space and expressing dissatisfaction with her approach. The flight attendant informed the passengers that those not complying with mask policies would be removed, and she summoned the captain again. Paramedics arrived and removed the passenger in seat ZZ1 from the flight. The station manager later arrived and was informed that the passengers in seats YY1 and YY2 needed to be removed for mask non-compliance and interference with crew duties. As a result, all identified passengers were removed from the flight, allowing the journey to continue safely. The solution involved ensuring compliance with mask policies and addressing interference with crew duties through passenger removal.",emergency
1782122,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and a group of passengers who refused to comply with the face mask policy during a nearly two-hour flight. The flight attendant reported that the group, part of an organization, repeatedly ignored mask requirements and laughed or mocked attempts to enforce the policy. Despite multiple attempts by the flight attendant and their colleague to address the issue with both individual passengers and adult leaders of the group, compliance was not achieved. The flight attendant requested that the offending passengers be denied further transportation upon landing, but this request was not granted by leadership in ZZZ. As a result, the group was allowed to continue on their next flight.",emergency
1607955,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved an ERJ-175 flight crew and a flight attendant during departure from ZZZ. After starting the first engine, a warning indicated a forward door was ajar. The flight crew communicated with the attendant to check and recycle the door. During this, the emergency slide deployed, an inadvertent deployment with no injuries. The cause was attributed to a miscommunication regarding the term ""recycle,"" leading to confusion. Contributing factors included a delayed flight and rushed procedures. To prevent recurrence, the flight manual's terminology will be revised for clarity, and procedures will be followed more meticulously.",emergency
1608882,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident involved a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight, leading to a conflict with the flight attendants. The flight attendants noticed a strong smell of marijuana when the passenger exited the aft lavatory and observed smoke inside the lavatory. The passenger appeared paranoid and initially lied to the police about his actions. The flight attendants called the captain, and upon landing, police were summoned. During questioning, the passenger denied using marijuana but later admitted to smoking in the cabin and lavatory after a vape pen, which tested positive for THC, was found in his possession. The passenger was detained, and the flight attendants reported the incident to the authorities. The flight attendant experienced throat irritation and a headache, possibly due to the effects of THC exposure. The police confirmed the vape pen contained THC, leading to the passenger's confession and detention.",emergency
1505311,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and ground personnel (Party2) during aircraft operations. The flight attendant opened the 1L door of a 737 aircraft in the armed position after receiving a thumbs-up signal from the station agent. This caused the slide pack to dislodge and partially deploy. The flight attendant immediately grabbed the door to prevent further deployment, instructed the agent to step back, and informed the captain. The captain assumed control, ensuring passenger safety, communicating the situation to passengers, and coordinating with maintenance. The slide pack was eventually removed, and passengers were safely deplaned. The incident was attributed to the flight attendant's failure to follow proper disarm procedures, including the monitor and challenge protocol, due to physical and mental fatigue, discomfort, and distractions from prior incidents during the day. The flight attendant acknowledged the lapse in focus and expressed intent to adhere strictly to procedures in the future. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further complications.",emergency
1516706,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a B737 flight crew responding to smoke in the aft lavatory, which was traced to a passenger's electronic cigarette. Upon notification, the smoke alarm activated, causing cabin chaos. The captain, departing from standard protocol, left the flight deck to personally assess the situation, concluding no immediate fire hazard existed. After extinguishing the alarm and inspecting the lavatory, the captain instructed the flight attendants to lock the lavatory and monitor the situation. Despite the First Officer's departure from standard procedure by opening the flight deck door, the captain returned and decided to continue the flight to the destination. Later, the flight attendants found the electronic cigarette, confirming its role in the incident. The captain's actions prioritized safety, aligning with company policies.",emergency
1412286,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred during the cruise phase of a B737-800 flight about 45 minutes prior to landing at ZZZ. The First Officer (FO) required a physiological break and temporarily left the cockpit to use the forward lavatory. A flight attendant (FA) entered the cockpit in accordance with standard procedures, closing the door behind them. During the FO's absence, a Hispanic passenger approached the forward galley. The FA instructed the passenger to either use one of the rear lavatories or return to her seat, as she was not permitted to remain in the galley. The passenger, who did not understand English, was initially uncooperative. However, the three FAs, who spoke fluent Spanish, repeatedly explained the situation. Despite this, the passenger refused to comply, verbally abused, and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA was called to assist. The 'A' FA informed the Captain via interphone, who heard loud voices and ongoing dialogue between the FAs and the passenger in Spanish. The FO, having exited the lavatory, joined the situation in the galley. After several minutes, the passenger's husband intervened and persuaded her to return to her seat. With the passenger seated and the FAs, including the male deadheading FA, positioned to block access to the forward galley and cockpit door, the cockpit door was opened. The FA exited the cockpit, and the FO returned. The cockpit was then secured in accordance with Threat Level 1 protocols. Upon arrival at ZZZ, law enforcement was summoned to remove the passenger from the aircraft. The Captain, after consulting with the FO and visually confirming the galley's security, determined it was safer for the FO to remain in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. The incident highlighted the need for recurrent security training, particularly addressing scenarios where the cockpit is locked down with one pilot in the cabin. The discussion raised questions about the safest seating arrangement for an FA in such situations—whether in the jumpseat or a pilot seat.",emergency
1441841,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred during the arrival into [destination] when smoke was reported in the cabin due to an e-cigarette battery experiencing thermal runaway. The flight crew donned oxygen masks, communicated with the flight deck team, and requested a direct approach to [destination]. The flight attendants successfully contained the device and its spare batteries in an ion battery emergency containment bag, resolving the smoke issue. Despite the situation being controlled, the flight crew remained on oxygen throughout the approach and landing. Upon landing, the flight crew was surrounded by Fire Rescue, surprising the flight attendants who had been making announcements. The incident highlighted a communication lapse, with the captain failing to follow up with the flight attendants after initially notifying them of the oxygen use. The captain acknowledged the need for better resource management and delegation, recognizing that shared responsibilities could have mitigated the distractions and improved communication.",emergency
1443217,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved an A321 flight where the flight attendant (Party2) reported not receiving the approach announcement from the flight crew (Party1). This led to the cabin not being fully secured for landing. During the landing, a passenger was found in the forward lavatory, which is against safety protocols. The flight attendant instructed the passenger to stay in the lavatory and brace for landing. After touchdown, the passenger attempted to return to his seat but was initially prevented due to the Captain's unresponsiveness. The flight attendant informed the Captain of the situation, after which the aircraft stopped briefly, allowing the passenger to return to his seat. The Captain later apologized, citing that Air Traffic Control had changed the runway three times, which delayed the timely approach announcement. The passenger was unharmed, and the flight attendant conveyed the Captain's apology to the crew.",emergency
1447118,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident began when an intoxicated passenger reported being shocked by exposed wires in the PSU of his armrest. Despite the flight attendant's offer of medical assistance, the passenger refused help and became agitated. He mentioned suing the airline and was observed consuming alcohol, appearing inebriated. The attendant moved him to another seat and taped the PSU. As the passenger's behavior escalated, including following the attendant and attempting to video her in the galley, he pushed her when she制止ed him. The attendant then alerted the purser, leading to a level one response, which concluded their interaction. The solution involved crew intervention to manage the situation.",emergency
1324189,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident occurred between a flight attendant (Party1) and ground personnel (Party2) during the boarding process of a flight with 127 passengers. The flight attendant was assisting a non-English speaking woman with an infant and needed to find two adjacent seats for the family. Despite making multiple announcements requesting volunteers to move, the flight attendant faced difficulties in securing the cabin. During this time, the ground personnel (OPS agent) repeatedly closed the forward entry door before the cabin was fully secured, disregarding the flight attendant's instructions to wait until all passengers were seated and bags stowed. The OPS agent dismissed the flight attendant's concerns and even shooed her away, causing the door to nearly hit her. The flight attendant reported the incident to the captain, who then summoned a Ground Operations Supervisor. The OPS agent claimed the door closed due to wind, but the flight attendant and another crew member disputed this, stating the door was manually closed. The situation was ultimately resolved with the supervisor's intervention.",emergency
1349852,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"During a flight approaching Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), a passenger became unruly and disruptive after consuming two alcoholic beverages. The passenger removed her seatbelt during the approach, walked around the cabin, and refused to comply with crew instructions, despite returning to her seat and fastening her seatbelt. The flight attendants initially contacted the flight deck, reporting the situation. When the passenger's behavior continued to escalate, the flight attendants activated the emergency call button, prompting the flight crew to stop the aircraft and coordinate with air traffic control (ATC) and ground operations. The flight crew, with the assistance of law enforcement, delayed deplaning until the passenger could be escorted off the aircraft. The passenger was eventually removed by security after becoming physically aggressive with the law enforcement officer. The incident was attributed to alcohol-related behavior and resulted in delays due to communication challenges, as the aircraft's ACARS system had failed, complicating coordination with ground staff. The flight crew emphasized the importance of clear and timely communication from the flight attendants regarding potential cabin issues. They suggested that earlier notification of the situation could have allowed for better management of workload and a smoother response. Additionally, the flight crew highlighted the need for flight attendants to provide a more detailed account of cabin events to help pilots assess the situation accurately and make informed decisions.",emergency
1388303,Flight Attendant,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred during a flight when a passenger in seat 12B, diagnosed with lung cancer, used a personal oxygen bottle not listed on the manifest. The flight attendant, initially unaware, was informed by the passenger's girlfriend that TSA had permitted the bottle. Upon realizing the bottle's presence, the flight attendant retrieved an onboard portable oxygen bottle, instructed the passenger to turn off his personal device, and notified the cockpit. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of verifying oxygen device usage and being vigilant during boarding to prevent similar occurrences. The result was the passenger switching to the provided onboard bottle.",emergency
1274044,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident originated from concerns raised by the flight attendant regarding a female passenger's medical condition, which included bandaged head injuries, facial swelling, and possible medication use. The passenger's husband insisted she could perform emergency exit duties, despite her unresponsive nature to relevant questions. The flight attendant sought to reseat the passenger from an exit row due to her medical state. The Customer Service Representative (CSR) initially resisted this request. After consultation with the purser and supervisor, the passengers were reseated. Post-takeoff, the female passenger experienced a medical emergency, leading to an in-flight call for medical assistance. An emergency room doctor and other medical personnel assessed her condition, diagnosed a possible seizure or clot, and recommended a diversion. The flight was diverted to Airport ZZZ, where the passenger was removed by EMTs and taken to the hospital. The flight resumed its journey after the incident was resolved.",emergency
1242903,Ground Personnel,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred after a flight crew arrived at the gate in DEN when a caterer opened an armed door without authorization, with the red tape still across the viewport, causing the slide pack to deploy onto the deck of a catering truck. The slide did not inflate, and the flight attendant instructed the caterer and nearby crew to move away to avoid potential risks. Mechanics were summoned, and they discovered that the slide had not been inspected since 1994, far exceeding the required inspection intervals. The incident highlighted the importance of proper inspection and maintenance of safety equipment.",emergency
1244422,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"The incident occurred on a regional jet during a flight when a Flight Attendant (FA) discovered that the prerecorded passenger safety briefing incorrectly stated that life vests were stored under the seats. The aircraft in question does not have life vests under the seats, as it has never been equipped with them. The FA reported this discrepancy to the flight deck after reaching 10,000 feet, informing the First Officer (FO) and subsequently the Captain (CA) about the issue. The FA also mentioned that she had previously reported this problem to management but had not received a resolution. During the communication, the FO misunderstood the FA's intent and believed she was indicating that the aircraft was missing life vests. This misunderstanding led the FO to inform the CA that an emergency landing was necessary. The CA, unaware of the confusion, prepared for a code yellow emergency landing, informing the passengers and directing the FA to contact management immediately. The FA vehemently denied having suggested that life vests were missing, emphasizing that she had pointed out the safety video's inaccuracy. The situation escalated when the CA called the FA again, revealing that the FO had misrepresented the situation. The CA admitted that the previous communication about the emergency landing was a joke, causing further confusion and distress for the FA. The FA felt targeted and upset, particularly when the CA laughed off the situation and corrected the timeline for landing, leaving the passengers and crew uninformed about the delay. The breakdown in Crew Resource Management (CRM) was further evident when the flight deck failed to provide a proper descent announcement, requiring the FA to inform the passengers herself. Upon landing, the CA made a demeaning comment about the FA's luggage, which was overheard by the other Flight Attendant. The incident resulted in a significant breakdown of CRM, impacting the professionalism and safety of the flight. The FA suggested addressing the faulty safety video as a solution to prevent similar issues in the future.",emergency
1152312,Flight Attendant,Other,"The incident occurred during the approach to landing when a passenger entered the lavatory, lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke alarm and message panel. The Flight Attendant requested the passenger return to her seat, but she refused. The Captain addressed the passenger via a public announcement, prompting her to exit the lavatory, where she cursed and claimed to have used feminine hygiene spray. The Flight Attendant discovered the spray but no cigarettes, suggesting the passenger's defiance indicated guilt. The smoke alarm disrupted cockpit communication during a critical phase. The passenger was detained by police but not arrested. The Flight Attendant believes FAA regulations should be enforced against her for smoking in the lavatory and non-compliance.",emergency
1059220,Flight Attendant,ATC,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) at Lafayette Airport. The flight attendant reported receiving taxi clearance to Runway 4R via Bravo and Juliette. After confirming the clearance with the first officer and referencing the airport diagram, the crew began taxiing. They momentarily stopped on Runway 4L for safety checks and continued toward Juliette. Upon reaching Juliette and turning right, they stopped before crossing Runway 11 and received a call from Ground Control regarding a possible deviation. Ground Control provided a phone number and later cleared the crew to cross Runway 11 and proceed to Runway 4R. Upon reaching the holding short area, the Tower informed the crew that they had crossed Runway 4L without clearance. The flight attendant stated that the crew had intended to follow the taxi clearance as understood, which they believed included crossing intervening runways. The flight attendant attributed the misunderstanding to the taxi clearance instructions, which they claimed were ambiguous and different from the usual format (""Taxi Runway 4R via Bravo and hold short Runway 4L""). The first officer reportedly misapplied the instructions, leading to the unintended crossing of Runway 4L. The crew ultimately followed the corrected instructions and resolved the situation without further incident.",emergency
1049196,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant aboard an ERJ-170 who reported that the Captain failed to properly brief and prepare the cabin crew for an emergency situation. The flight was diverted to a nearby airport due to a message alert indicating a potential loss of critical aircraft systems, which could have been catastrophic. Despite the severity of the situation, the Captain provided insufficient information to the cabin crew, did not follow standard operating procedures (SOP) for emergencies, and appeared to discourage communication with the flight attendants. This led to a breakdown in communication and a lack of Crew Resource Management (CRM) during the abnormal situation. After landing, maintenance personnel revealed that the issue was more severe than initially communicated. The Captain's failure to debrief the cabin crew and the First Officer's apparent restraint from sharing information further exacerbated the situation. The Flight Attendant noted that the lack of transparency and poor communication strained the crew's ability to ensure passenger safety and maintain cabin integrity.",emergency
960656,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved an A319 flight where the flight crew declared an emergency due to a flap/slat fault during approach. The captain successfully landed the aircraft but acknowledged providing an incomplete briefing to the flight attendants regarding the post-landing procedures and the status of exterior inspections by ground personnel. After landing, the captain instructed the flight attendants to return to their stations but did not immediately inform them to remain seated until the aircraft was safely taxied to the gate. The captain later realized that the cabin volume control had not been fully turned down, allowing him to overhear the flight attendants' confused conversations about the delay in receiving further instructions. This led the captain to recognize the need for a more detailed briefing in the future to ensure the flight attendants were better prepared for such situations.",emergency
967088,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant misunderstood an order to arm the doors, leading to an emergency exit slide being deployed at the gate by a caterer. The Flight Attendant believed they had heard the Lead Flight Attendant instruct to ""prepare doors"" and proceeded to check the cabin. Upon reaching the forward galley, they discovered the front entry door and cockpit doors were open. A caterer approached and explained that they had intentionally opened the forward entry door, mistaking the orange safety strap for a signal to deploy the slide due to sunglass glare. The slide was fully deployed and facing upward, creating an obstruction. The Flight Attendant, along with the caterer and gate agent, secured the slide, moved the aircraft to another gate, and coordinated with ground staff to bring a replacement aircraft. Passengers were deplaned, and the flight resumed less than 50 minutes after the initial delay. No injuries were reported, and the situation was handled efficiently. The Flight Attendant acknowledged the importance of double-checking procedures and expressed gratitude for the positive outcome. The caterer was unharmed but was advised against such actions in the future.",emergency
977727,Flight Attendant,Flight Crew,"The incident involved a safety strap on the B737's L2 door becoming trapped during closure. The flight attendant noticed the issue and informed the cockpit, but the pilots assessed it as low risk, deciding to proceed with takeoff. During the flight, a loud squealing noise developed, prompting an immediate return to the departure airport. Mechanics confirmed the door's integrity, and the flight resumed after refueling. The flight attendant suggested incorporating a more thorough strap check into pre-flight procedures. The pilot acknowledged bias from past experiences and operational constraints, learning the importance of resolving such issues before takeoff to prevent disruptions.",emergency
885338,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident occurred due to a landing gear anomaly during a flight, prompting an aborted landing and a 20-minute hold in the air. The flight crew successfully landed the aircraft without further issues. However, the cabin crew were not informed of the emergency until after landing, when they noticed emergency vehicles and discussed the situation with the captain.

This incident highlights the importance of timely communication during emergencies to ensure passenger safety and crew preparedness.",emergency
904412,Flight Crew,Flight Attendant,"The incident involved a CRJ aircraft diverting to a nearby airport due to a female passenger experiencing a medical emergency, including vomiting and abdominal pains. The flight crew received initial reports from the cabin about the passenger's condition, followed by a request for medical assistance. The cabin crew's communication was described as panicked, with incomplete information provided during initial contacts. The flight crew prepared for the diversion, informed air traffic control (ATC), and requested emergency services at the diversion airport. The aircraft landed at ZZZ, where paramedics transported the passenger to a hospital. Following the landing, the flight crew discovered that emergency oxygen equipment had been used and was not properly serviced. The Captain expressed concern over the cabin crew's handling of the situation and their communication regarding the use of emergency equipment. Maintenance was called to service the oxygen bottle and defer the First Aid Kit, which had been used during the incident. The flight crew also reviewed the inventory of the Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit (EEMK) and found discrepancies in its contents.

841929,Flight Crew,Other,"The incident occurred when an A319 aircraft experienced the automatic deployment of oxygen masks in the front cabin section due to toxic fumes and haze. The Lead Flight Attendant, showing excitement and respiratory distress, informed the crew. In response, the Flight Crew declared an emergency with Air Traffic Control (ATC) and diverted to the nearest suitable airport, completing the descent in approximately 6-7 minutes. Post-landing, the fumes dissipated, and the air cleared. The crew taxied to the gate, deplaned, and informed their company of their situation.",emergency
850257,Flight Attendant,Ground Personnel,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.",emergency
