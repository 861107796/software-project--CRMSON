# DO/BE/FEEL Motivational Model  

## **Who (Stakeholders)**  
- Flight Attendants: Use simulations to develop conflict management skills.  
- Maintenance Technicians: Practice procedural compliance and error reflection.  
- Commercial Captains: Safe Decision Making Under Training Stress  
- Cabin Crew Leads: Communication and coordination in leadership simulation scenarios.  
- Trainers / Instructors: Creating and managing simulation scripts.  
- System Developers: Maintain system functions and data integration.  
- Safety Analysts: Analyze interaction data to optimize training content.  

## **DO (Functional Goals)**  
_What should the system accomplish? Identify key features and functionality._  
- [ ] Functionality 1  Provide immersive, role-playing simulated dialogues
- [ ] Functionality 2  Support user behavior recording and feedback mechanism
- [ ] Functionality 3  Automatically recommend appropriate scenario cases based on user roles/intentions

## **BE (Quality Goals)**  
_How should the system behave? Identify key quality attributes._  
- Secure: Protect user data and interactive content to prevent leakage.
- Accessible: Versatile and easy to use.
- Scalable: Scalable to multiple roles, situations, and languages.

## **FEEL (Emotional Goals - OPTIONAL)**  
_How should stakeholders feel when interacting with the system?_  
- Confident: Feel the self-improvement and control in the simulation.
- Engaged: Systematic guidance and feedback in difficult situations.
- Supported: The interaction is simple and convenient, and can support continuous practice.

## **Motivational Model**  
_Based on the above lists, consider creating a simple Motivational Model diagram (e.g., using Miro, Draw.io) to represent the relationships between these elements._
