**1. The Project Journey**

**Destination (Goals)**

  * Develop a software that can simulate real aviation scenario dialogues based on user input to provide interactive training and auxiliary support for pilots, maintenance personnel, cabin crew, etc.
  * Through client feedback, we continuously optimize the accuracy and practicality of the LLM system to achieve a highly usable product.
  * Advancing our skills and experience in natural language processing, model training, and deployment.

**Route (Values)**

  * Agile development and rapid iteration: We encourage the working mode of "prototype first, then optimize" to advance quickly while maintaining quality.
  * Clear communication and consensus decision-making: We value the flow of information between team members and ensure that important decisions are discussed and agreed upon.
  * Continuous learning: We acknowledge that we are not experts in all areas, so we remain curious and open to new knowledge.

**Obstacles (Concerns)**

1. **Different Course and Assignment Schedules**  
   - Although our team members are all in the same area and maintain consistent communication, each person still faces unique course and assignment deadlines.  
   - Conflicting priorities may arise, possibly impacting the timely completion of project milestones.

2. **Potential Misalignment with User Needs**  
   - Despite proactive efforts to understand user requirements, there remains a risk of misinterpretation or misunderstanding.  
   - If regular check-ins and clarifications are not maintained, the final outcome may not fully align with user expectations.

**Communication**
| **Potential Issue**                        | **Response**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Different opinions among team members      | - During the weekly meeting, discuss each opinion in depth.  <br> - According to the discussion, vote for the final ideas. |
| Different schedules among team members     | - At the end of the meeting, discuss and adjust the time of the next meeting.  <br> - Keep other team members informed of your schedule. |

We will use GitHub Projects, zoom to share work(like documentation, code...) and communicate.

We expect all group members to show respect to others, listen to other teammates opinions, keep active for the group work, etc.

If there are repeated issues among group members, our course of action will be to speak to mentor, contact lecturers, etc.

**Responsibilities and Workload**

|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Group member(s) cannot meet a deadline       | - Each member must clearly estimate the workload before starting the task and update it in GitHub in a timely manner. <br>- If any difficulties are encountered, other team members must be informed promptly, and the team will discuss adjusting the progress or reallocating tasks together. |
| Group member(s) are overburdened by workload   | - Regular progress meetings will be held, and Scrum Master Xiang Zhou will monitor progress and adjust the division of labor as needed. <br>- Work will be allocated based on team members’ expertise and current workload to ensure that everyone has a similar number of tasks.                      |
