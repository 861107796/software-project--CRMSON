## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop **CRMSON**, a multi-agent AI chatbot designed to enhance team resilience in high-stakes environments such as aviation. By leveraging a proprietary dataset of team dynamics and aviation incidents, CRMSON provides evidence-based recommendations to improve communication, mitigate authority gradients, and address sociocultural challenges like sexism and racism.  

The system enables users to:  
- Generate tailored conversational strategies  
- Simulate interactions to prevent escalation  
- Reference relevant regulations to foster more effective teamwork  

Currently, we aim to build an **agent builder** capable of:  
- Generating AI agents based on aviation incident reports  
- Analyzing and comparing regulatory guidelines  
- Enhancing decision-making and conflict resolution  

## Technologies Used
- GitHub
- Python/JavaScript/etc.
- Other tools

## Scope
### In-Scope and Out-of-Scope
  - Only reports of aircraft carrying **passengers** are considered. Other mission types such as **training** and **cargo**, are not included in the training and testing process of this project.
  - Only reports of **communication breakdowns** between people are considered. Other reasons such as **maintenance** and **technical** issues are not included in the training and testing process of this project.
  - Only includes the core functionality for AI chatbots regarding **flight safety**, and other high-risk environment communications such as **submarines** and **nuclear power plants** are not included in this project.
  - Only includes the **typical** safety flight scenarios shown in the dataset, such as approach control and missed approach procedures, and **new scenarios** not present in the dataset will not be included.
  - Only uses the flying dictionary to **fine-tune** of existing open-source LLMs, **research and development** of advanced natural language processing algorithms is not included.
  - Only uses **open-source LLMs** and **proxy platforms**, **dedicated servers** and **paid LLMs** are not included.
  - Only considers generating the scenarios in **English**, the precise and  accurate translation of terms into **other languages** are not included.
  - Only produces the **individual** AI chatbots, the **integration** with Borderâ€™s internal systems, such as dispatch system and flight log system are not included.

### Functional requirements
  - Understand the scenarios prompted by the user, analyze and provide the top k relevant existing scenarios to the user.
  - Search for external resources and provide some reference rules.
  - Generate scenarios and chat with users for training purposes.
  - UI design suitable for user interaction.

### Non-Functional requirements
  - It does not have dependencies on the platform and LLM currently used. Can be adapted to a dedicated server and using paid LLM once we have resources.
  - Users' privacy should be protected.
  - Most of the time, the system should be available.
  - Once we have enough resources, can upgrade the system to generate more scenarios. It should have good scalability.
  - Reasonable response time, should not crash at high throughput.
