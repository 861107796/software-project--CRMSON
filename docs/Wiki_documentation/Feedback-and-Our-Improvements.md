| Feedback | How did we improve in Sprint2 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Minor grammatical errors. | We use tools like Google Translate, Grammarly, etc. to correct our sentences. |
| the Task board lacks proper task descriptions and traceability. | Clarify the criteria for task creation, such as description, story points, start date, and end date. For document-type tasks, keep a link to its wiki page. For feature-type tasks, keep references to specific user stories and their dependencies. For previously completed tasks, fill in supplementary information. |
| branch naming conventions are vague. | Clarify the naming standard of branches, avoid using the developer's name, and name them according to the purpose of the branch. For example, UI design, LLM fine-tuning. |
| The docs/ folder is missing the required documentation for submission. | Uploaded the wiki pages to the docs folder. | 
| clearly assign reviewers to tasks. | Our teamâ€™s Scrum Master will be responsible for reviewing our tasks before setting them as done. |
| What will be delivered in the Sprint Review. | A new page has been added to the wiki to show our sprint planning and retrospective, which will describe what we have done, what went well, and what needs improvement. |
| The video slightly exceeded the time limit. | Be more careful when making videos and include only the important content to reduce the video length. |
