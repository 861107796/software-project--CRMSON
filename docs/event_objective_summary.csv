The flight attendant cited unclear company policies on lithium-ion batteries and excessive enforcement of carry-on policies by ground personnel as contributing factors. The flight attendant suggested that such bags should not be gate-checked, underscoring the importance of improved guidelines and staff training to prevent future breaches.","lithium batteries, training, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

At no time was the entertainment system switched off prior to; during or following the demonstration. Once the demonstration was complete I went to the aft galley; where only 3 FAs (Flight Attendants) sit; and offered to be a 4th FA and sit at jump seat  and assume FA #8. I was in uniform and willing to assist. A short while later the Purser came to the back galley and informed me that she only wanted working"" FAs to be involved and asked that I return to my seat in the cabin. As the aircraft approached the runway there was no command from the Flight Deck to assume the demonstrated brace positions which made something of a mockery of performing an evacuation demonstration. After landing and deplaning the DHD (Deadhead) FAs were then converted to work the sector departing some 5 hours later at XA50 landing in ZZZZ airport at XK33; meaning extreme fatigue ensued due to being awake for approx. 27 hours prior to landing. The operating Pilots and FAs were released from duty following the incident yet the DHD crew onboard were not afforded the same courtesy even though they had less hours available to them and had experienced the same situation.""",,,,An off-duty Flight Attendant reported while dead heading the aircraft had an issue with the landing gear and offered to assist with safety procedures but was denied.,"The incident involved an off-duty Flight Attendant (Party1) who attempted to assist during a safety procedure on a flight. The aircraft experienced an issue with the landing gear, prompting the captain to conduct a preparation for land evacuation demonstration. During this time, Party1, who was in uniform and seated in the cabin, volunteered to assist by taking on the role of FA #8 at the jump seat in the aft galley. However, the Purser (Party2) denied this offer, instructing Party1 to return to their seat in the cabin, stating that only working Flight Attendants should be involved in the safety procedure. After landing, the off-duty Flight Attendants (deadhead crew) were reassigned to work the next departing flight, which caused significant fatigue due to being awake for approximately 27 hours. This decision was particularly challenging because the deadhead crew had less time available compared to the on-duty crew, who were subsequently released from their duties. The inconsistency in treatment and the denial of assistance led to frustration among the deadhead crew, who felt their efforts and well-being were overlooked despite being part of the same incident. A proposed solution is to ensure fair treatment and consideration for all crew members, including those deadheading, in such situations.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

Ultimately; I failed to notify either Operations in ZZZ or the Captain. Upon reflection during the flight and; as not to create an 'issue;' I realized that I had failed to handle the situation correctly. In an effort to not continue the risk; upon arrival in ZZZ1; I spoke with the Operations Agent and explained the situation and asked if it could be corrected. The Operations Agent indicated to me that the passenger's bags would be pulled prior to their connecting flight. I then spoke to the passenger(s) and asked them to speak with the Operations Agent.

After arriving; the reporter notified an Operations Agent to deal with the bag's contents.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who was informed by a passenger that their checked luggage contained an electric razor and a camera, potentially housing lithium batteries. The attendant initially failed to notify Operations or the Captain, possibly due to uncertainty about the items. Upon realizing the oversight, the attendant informed an Operations Agent upon arrival, leading to the passenger's bags being pulled before their connecting flight. The attendant reflected on the importance of safety and suggested enhancing procedures to reduce human error through better screening of checked baggage for lithium batteries.","between attendant and passengers, crew-related issues, equipment malfunction, training, operational issues"

Two passengers; the one I was talking to; and another let me know that they had laptops in their bags. I let the A-FA know what was going on so that he could help monitor what was going on; and the passengers went to the front of the plane to retrieve their laptops. I let the CA and Gate Agent know what was going on when I was able to make it to the front of the plane because the passengers had come back down the aisle and said the Ramp person; or someone; had told them the cargo hold was closed and they weren't going to get them. It's my understanding that all laptops and lithium batteries need to be taken out and are unable to go in that cargo area; so that is when I spoke with the Captain and Gate Agent. The Captain said we would wait. The passengers then came back again and said the CA said that it was ok to go due to the size and them being off. I checked with the CA one last time and he deemed it safe. I was not there for the conversation when they declared it safe; so I can only go with the CA telling me it is safe.If something was deemed safe by the CA then I go with that; but just everyone checking bags beforehand; Gate Agents and also ramp crew not saying no due to potentially just not wanting to get the bag. But if it's declared safe; it's declared safe.,,,,ERJ-170 Flight Attendant reported to the Captain and Gate Agent that two passenger bags with laptops that had lithium-ion batteries were mistakenly gate checked in cargo during boarding. The Captain then deemed it safe to not remove as the devices were off and approved gate departure.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) who identified two gate-checked bags containing laptops with lithium-ion batteries during boarding. The flight attendant informed the other flight attendant and the captain about the situation, as these items are prohibited in cargo holds due to safety regulations. Two passengers confirmed they had laptops in their bags, and they retrieved them after being instructed to do so. However, the passengers reported that ground personnel had initially prevented them from retrieving the laptops, stating the cargo hold was closed. The flight attendant communicated with the captain and gate agent, and the captain eventually deemed the situation safe, allowing the flight to depart.

I suggested she speak to the speak to the A-FA in the front and see if it was possible. Once she went back to the front and saw the ramp agent threw her bag down; she approached me again and began yelling at me demanding an explanation for the other flight attendants refusal. I explained that it's protocol for any tagged bag to be sent to cargo. She returned to her seat after our discussion. It wasn't until we were inflight and I was doing beverage service that I noticed she was filling out a complaint form to company. I saw her writing but I continued with my duties and asked if she wanted anything to drink or a snack. She looked at me; noted my name and requested water. After I finished service; I started to reorganize my galley for the next flight. However; I heard several overhead bins opening simultaneously which concerned me. I discovered that the passenger had opened them and was taking photos of all the empty bins. I needed to prioritize securing my galley so I focused on the safety in the back. Once I finished; I checked to see if the passenger was still standing in the aisle but she had returned to her seat. I called the A-FA to inform her about the passengers actions and we both agreed to notify the Captain. The A-FA also mentioned another issue involving a different passenger who had allegedly checked a bag containing lithium batteries and medication. I then updated the Captain about the upset passenger regarding her checked bag.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported a passenger misconduct and an unrelated issue of a passenger who allegedly checked a bag with lithium battery. The Captain was notified of both issues with no additional information provided.,"The incident occurred on a flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1, involving a passenger (Party2) and a flight attendant (Party1). The cause was the passenger's refusal to check her bag for an international trip, leading to a confrontation. The process began with the passenger insisting her bag fit in the overhead compartment, which the flight attendant redirected to the front attendant. When the passenger was denied, she became upset, yelled at the flight attendant, and filled out a complaint form during the flight. The result was the passenger opening multiple overhead bins and taking photos, prompting the flight attendant to secure the galley and notify the captain. The captain was informed about both this misconduct and a separate issue involving a passenger's bag with lithium batteries.

I was uncomfortable with that and reopened and closed the door. On; the next flight; ZZZ to ZZZ1; we rushed boarding; with a full flight and a jump seater. I had done my drink orders. Boarding was complete and the Captain said it was ok to close the MC (Main Cabin) door. After flight attendant B said cross check; I didn't feel like the MC door had closed completely. So; I asked; the Captain if the flight deck indicator said my door was locked and he replied no. I was thinking I needed to resecure the door. In feeling a time limit; I rushed to open the door it felt heavy and I felt the resistance so I only cracked it before I saw a little part of the grey slide appearing.  I stopped opening  the door and told the captain. The Captain was trying to communicate to the jet bridge driver and calling the necessary people and the jet bridge driver and supervisor did the same.  I noticed the  door was armed; when the airport managers came over and took pictures. The Captain made a PA. Passengers calmly deplaned by 2L door with their belongings and went to the boarding area at the next gate.

I made the PA that cross check was complete and cabin was ready for push back. I picked up demo equipment and started to walk towards the front of cabin when I received a call from A FA; they told me that they blew the L1 slide. Then the captain and airport officials coordinated deplaning from the L2 door.

During the same time; Captain got on the Phone with Operations and phone patched to Maintenance Control; where they attempted multiple resets to no success. When Captain got off the phone with Maintenance; he said; 'Well nothing fixed It; and they (Maintenance) said we are on our own.'At that point; we agreed as a crew that we didn't know what was going on down there. We were both not comfortable taking an aircraft with this indication over water; with limited divert options to an international location; and with no company or Contract Maintenance at the destination not knowing what was going on down there. The indication was steady at this point; not rising higher [than] 194 degrees; nor giving any other indications to the back when we notified the Flight Attendants and told them what was going on. At this point; we felt we were not in a land as soon as possible scenario; but in a land as soon as practical scenario but keeping land as soon as possible options available and we decided to divert to ZZZ2. We gave ATC a PAN PAN call since we were going to a divert airport that wasn't our alternate but that we were not at the time an emergency aircraft; we just wanted to have all our bases covered. We notified Dispatch both via phone patch and ACARS. During descent we were cleared the ZZZZZ Arrival to ZZZ2.We were still grossly overweight with a lot of gas; so we referenced the overweight Checklist. With that; we decided that with the condition still not worsening from what had been continuously indicated with no secondary indications or issues coming from the cabin; Captain and I both agreed that in an effort not to compound the problem we should hold to burn down gas; but having immediate [landing] options nearby; so we held at ZZZZZ1 at 16;000 ft. for 30-40 min and got to a calculated weight that would put us on deck in ZZZ2 right at Max landing weight. We continued to ZZZ2 via the arrival; for an uneventful Runway XX landing. On a side note; the XX transition from the ZZZZZ Arrival is a bit of a slam dunk. We asked for a bit longer final to get down; stabilized; and situated; and ATC approach gave us a few last second altitude; headings; and speed amendments through final which started to task saturate us as we prepared for landing. For example: open descent from 6;000-3;000; we were told to amend altitude and maintain 4;000 ft. while passing 4;200 feet; thrust idle; and speed brakes out. We blew through the altitude and had to climb back up Auto Pilot off; ALT horn blaring; and engines spooling up to 80+%; and getting speed brakes back in. We were also given several headings through final; and were asked to slow to final approach speed 10 plus miles outside the final approach fix at 4;000 feet; and approach didn't give us an approach clearance until we had flown through the glide slope on the localizer; and had to join from above; in order to sequence aircraft landing [Runway] XYL; which started to compound our landing configuration planning; and a go around was not something we were hoping to do; especially off of a PAN PAN call. We later found that on a couple of occurrences; ATC did not pass the PANPAN or divert info from Center to Center to Approach. We were later reassigned upon arrival to fly a ZZZ3 Turn that left in 5 minutes.I told Company that we just went through a lot; and that if they wanted us to fly that turn; that I needed a break for an amount of time that I was setting; some food; and so the Captain and I went and had a sit down meal; decompressed; talked about what had happened; after an hour or so I assessed my fitness for duty and felt I was good to fly the turn. The Captain and I were sitting on the jet; and when we called for push going to ZZZ3; Ramp told us to hold and that Maintenance wanted to talk to us. The maintenance team member got on the radio; asked if we were the crew that brought Aircraft X in from ZZZ; I replied yes; and he told us we needed to fill out a fume report. Captain asked what he was talking about; and told him this was the first we have heard about any fume incident. The Maintainer on the radio said the Flight Attendants had filed a fume report after the flight; and we needed to do the same. The Flight Attendants never told us anything about fumes nor their intent to fill out any such reports. Captain then filed a fume report said he had no information to give for we knew nothing about it. I felt Captain had communicated very clearly what was going on to the flight attendants about the situation; and our intent to divert. They had never communicated any such issues during any duration of or after the flight. Unknown from the high temperature in the Aft Cargo Bay. We did later saw that Maintenance replaced the sensor in the aft cargo bay via the app. We were curious that with all the ZZZ team members in Training vests if maybe they stacked the bags in the aft cargo bay above the line and possibly covered the sensor or did something to It. However; As far as the 'suspected' fume event; there was no communication from the flight attendants to the cockpit crew for this event. We noticed via the app that Maintenance later deferred the APU to prevent 'further fume events' due to the suspected fume event we were later notified about from ZZZ2 Maintenance. Not sure why if there is a fume event (or even a suspected fume event) why they don't further investigate the problem or fix the problem; rather than just pencil whip it into deferment. If there was any fumes in this situation; how would MX (Maintenance) know they came from the APU and not from any potential problem we were encountering? Put quick reference limitations on a Cockpit Card or in the QRH or checklist to quickly reference for situations such as these. I felt like we were on an Easter egg hunt for something that we later found wasn't there which wasted a lot of our decision making time. I know that Airbus FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) and other manufacture manuals/reference material has such limitations for quick reference from my experience at a previous Airbus airline. Why can't the company get on board with Airbus??? Make sure Flight Attendants communicate to the cockpit if they were smelling fumes.,,,,A321 First Officer reported an abnormally elevated Aft Cargo Bay temperature during cruise. After conferring with maintenance; the flight executed a precautionary diversion for maintenance.,"The incident involved an A321 flight crew (Party 1) and a flight attendant (Party 2). During the flight, the crew noticed an abnormally high aft cargo bay temperature (194 degrees), which was above standard operating parameters. The crew consulted manuals and contacted maintenance but found no immediate solution. Concerned about the situation, particularly over water with limited diversion options, the crew decided to divert to ZZZ2. They made a PAN PAN call to inform ATC and contacted dispatch. During descent and landing at ZZZ2, the crew encountered challenges with overweight landing conditions and ATC communication, but the landing was uneventful. Post-landing, maintenance informed the crew that a fume report had been filed by the flight attendants, though the crew had no prior knowledge of fumes or related issues during the flight. Maintenance deferred the APU to prevent further fume events. The crew expressed concerns about the lack of communication from the flight attendants regarding the suspected fume event and questioned the adequacy of maintenance's response. They recommended improved communication protocols between the cockpit and cabin crew, better access to quick reference materials for such situations, and a more thorough investigation of potential issues instead of deferred fixes.","between attendant and crew, crew-related issues, equipment malfunction, fume/smoke incident, operational issues, communication issues"

The Ops Agent gate checked the bag. The passenger told the Flight Attendant after a few minutes that the bag was a smart bag. The Ops Agent was then notified by the Flight Attendant that the bag was ' smart' and had to be addressed properly by the ramp (disconnect the battery). The FA (Flight Attendant) then found room for the bag in the cabin and the Ops Agent went and grabbed the bag from below the wing. After we left; we were informed that the bag was brought back up to the cabin. During cruise I asked the A-Flight Attendant to come up to the cabin and showed him in the book where it says you cannot do that. The B-FA also informed the A of the error.I believe I should have been more involved with the bag; I thought the bag was being dealt with by Ground Ops properly. The combination of a new Ops Agent; and a new FA; I was getting food (terminal) were all contributing factors.""",,,,Air Carrier Captain reported a miscommunication between the Captain and a Flight Attendant regarding a gate checked smart bag that was erroneously loaded in the cargo compartment. The smart bag was relocated to passenger cabin prior to gate departure.,"The incident arose from a miscommunication between the flight captain and a flight attendant regarding the handling of a smart bag. Contributing factors included the inexperience of the new ops agent and flight attendant, as well as the captain's distraction while retrieving food, leading to a lack of direct involvement in the bag's handling. The flight attendant initially gate-checked the smart bag, which was later identified as requiring special handling. The ops agent retrieved the bag from the cargo area after being notified. During the flight, the captain noticed the bag in the cabin and pointed out the policy violation. The flight attendant acknowledged the mistake, and the bag's handling was corrected. The smart bag was erroneously loaded into the cargo compartment but was later moved to the passenger cabin. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and involvement by the captain, especially when dealing with safety-sensitive items like smart bags. The captain reflected on the need to be more involved in the handling of such items and recognized the impact of new staff and distractions on communication. This awareness serves as a lesson for future operations.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

They said they saw a personal oxygen machine that you plug into the wall at home being brought up for our passenger who was deplaning in ZZZ and LFA asked what is that and where did it come from. Apparently it was checked in and was with the baggage under the plane from my understanding; the way the LFA explained it to us all. I never got to see it because I was in the back of the plane and by the time I made it to the front; all passengers had deplaned.From my understanding; personal oxygen is not allowed to be brought on the plane and kept on person or be checked in. This is a very serious matter and needs to be looked into before this passenger tries to travel back with it on the next flight or if someone else brings it and employees don't follow the safety protocols/rules.

The first class wasn't even deplaned. Only three people had deplaned while others were trying to get their bag down and deplane. I said no not at this point; which in turn the first cleaner gave me serious attitude. The Gate Agent came down; no mask on; with an attitude about us not letting the cleaners enter to clean. They had 12 people to clean; usually they have a shortage of cleaners. But we hadn't even had first class passengers cleared and they started coming on. I asked not yet; let the passengers deplane and this flight is a full flight. This is becoming a serious issue at times and passengers getting upset they can't deplane and usually the cleaners keep cleaning and not moving in so they can deplane. Understand at this time with COVID the importance of cleaning but passengers complain at me about cleaners not clearing so the could deplane. It's stressful enough with all we are dealing with no food drinks and upset passengers about what they can't have. Our passengers were moving quick and not stalling getting off.  When they were off we couldn't get our bags and personal items together.  The flight deck wasn't able to exit.

She stated 'could be electrical'. I stopped the aircraft; I got a minor whiff of something but it dissipated immediately. FO (First Officer) smelled nothing. We reported smoke in the cabin to ground and requested Airport rescue and Fire Fighting. We considered running the Smoke/AVIONICS SMOKE/Fumes but needed more information; (global assessment). I called up the 1st and she stated she was unaware of what was going on. I called back to the rear of the aircraft and 2nd stated it had begun to dissipate. After a brief discussion with FO; I elected to taxi to the gate and have Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting follow us and access the situation. Aircraft deplaned normally. 1st was unaware there was an issue 4th thought it was an electrical odor 2nd stated there was an odor but not a burning odor. He noticed a lite haze in the reading lights. [The possible cause] was primarily due to the dark cabin; communications among cabin crew. In a perfect world; there would have been better communication between all of the flight attendants; prior to calling up the flight deck. A more concrete assessment could have made with all eyes on the situation. Then the degree of urgency; and solid information can be transmitted more efficiently to the Captain.,,Taxiing to the gate on the terminal ramp we received a cabin call from the #4 FA (Flight Attendant) reporting smoke in the cabin. CA stopped the aircraft to assess the situation and asked if I smelled smoke or odor. I did not see or smell smoke or odor in the cockpit. CA said he sensed a brief odor but not burning.

The smoke report was entered in the AML and the fumes report [was] completed.,,A319 flight crew reported a fume/smoke event during arrival taxi to gate.,"An A319 flight encountered a fume/smoke event during its arrival taxi to the gate. The incident began when the fourth flight attendant (FA4) detected an odor and reported smoke, suspecting it might be electrical. The flight crew, led by the captain, halted the aircraft and assessed the situation. The captain noticed a brief whiff of something, while the first officer detected nothing. They contacted ground control and requested the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) team. The flight crew considered their checklist for smoke/fumes but sought more information. Upon contacting the cabin, FA1 reported no smoke or odor, while FA2 noted a dissipating odor and a light haze in the reading lights. The captain, after consulting with the first officer, decided to proceed to the gate for ARFF evaluation. The aircraft landed smoothly, and passengers deplaned normally. The event highlighted the challenges of communication among cabin crew in a darkened cabin. The suggested improvement was enhanced communication to ensure a more informed and coordinated response, allowing for a clearer assessment and more efficient information transfer to the flight deck. The incident underscores the importance of effective communication among cabin crew to enhance incident handling and preparedness.","fume/smoke incident, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

I (FA) contacted the terminal Supervisor who patched me through to Agent; in the tower. I told him of our plight and passenger complaints and concerns. He said he would send someone immediately to turn on the air. This was approximately 20 minutes later. About 15-20 minutes later we still had no air. Passengers were getting very upset and many took their masks off. We made announcements stating that without airflow; it was even more important to keep their mask on since they could not social distance. I contacted the Supervisor again and insisted the passengers be let off the aircraft if we were not going to get airflow and we still didn't know anything about when the pilots would arrive. Approximately 10 minutes later the pilots boarded and stated we should never have begun boarding under those conditions. They got air up and we departed 15 minutes later. 1 hour and 10 minutes after boarding. I felt very; very unsafe in those conditions as did many passengers.We should never board without air conditioning during COVID. If the pilots are running late; a mechanic should be brought down to turn on the air. A few minutes would be acceptable but when the tower is contacted; something should be done in a timely manner. Flight attendants should be allowed to let passengers deplane under such extreme conditions where everyone's safety and health are put at risk.,,,,Flight Attendant reported passengers were boarded before the pilots arrived at the aircraft.

Y dealt with the passenger while X closed the doors and made an announcement, with both stating the cabin was secure. However, X assumed Y would finish her duties, and Y believed X had secured the cabin. The confusion arose when the captain opened the flight deck door, expecting the cabin to be secure but was unaware of the status. Both realized their mutual assumption led to the oversight. They re-secured the cabin and resumed the briefing, causing a delay.

I told her I would go to the back while she checked the doors for me. I went to handle the passenger and she did closed doors and made the announcement. We both said cabin secure. I noticed the flight deck door was closed and had assumed she had done cabin secure for me seeing as I was tending to this passenger and she had done door closure for me. I continued on with the safety briefing. Approximately one minute into the safety briefing the Captain opened the flight deck door to inform me that no one informed him of cabin secure. Me and Flight Attendant X both became aware that we had assumed the other person had secured the cabin door and quickly re-secured the cabin. We continued on with our briefing.I believe we both made the mistake because of the destructive passenger. I had assumed that while I was tending to this passenger she had took over all of my duties and she assumed that I was going to finish my duties once I got back up into the gallery. I also believe the pilots close the door on their own to keep warm which is why we had gotten confused on the door being close.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being distracted by a disruptive passenger and forgetting to advise the flight crew the cabin was secure and they were ready to depart.,"The incident involved a misunderstanding between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding the cabin security process. The flight attendant was distracted by a disruptive passenger who refused to wear a mask, leading to an oversight in communication. After addressing the passenger, the flight attendant assumed the flight crew had been informed that the cabin was secure. Similarly, the flight crew believed the flight attendant had communicated the cabin's readiness. This mutual assumption resulted in the cabin not being properly secured before the safety briefing began. Approximately one minute into the briefing, the captain noticed the lack of communication and informed the flight attendant, prompting both parties to re-secure the cabin promptly. The incident was attributed to the distraction caused by the disruptive passenger and the crew's assumption that the other party had handled their respective duties.

Cleaners must wait for all passengers to deplane prior to boarding the aircraft.Cleaners in ZZZ are aggressively pushing their way into the forward galley to remove trash from the carts during the deplaning process. This impedes the flow of deplaning passengers and obstructs the ability of flight attendants to manage the flow of passengers and maintain door and safety compliance. Cleaners are insisting that flight attendants leave the galley area so they can work; they say operations has told them to move the crew to accomplish the cleaning task. Allowing cleaners to pull carts and trash while flight attendants and passengers are deplaning creates safety hazards (bumps; trips; and impacts from trash removal) and does not allow for safe social distancing as per company policy.  Cleaners also leave bags on the floor posing a trip hazard for crew and passengers deplaning; as I was deplaning a cleaner had left a gray cleaning tote below a jump-seat and I tripped over it falling into the bulkhead.,,,,Flight Attendant reported the aircraft cleaners are not adhering to the social distancing policy.,"The incident involved aircraft cleaners in ZZZ not adhering to established policies. They boarded the aircraft before all passengers had deplaned and entered the forward galley during the deplaning process, obstructing passenger flow and creating safety hazards. The cleaners insisted that flight attendants vacate the galley, claiming operational instructions. This led to safety concerns, including trip hazards from cleaning bags left on the floor. A flight attendant tripped over a gray cleaning tote, falling into the bulkhead. The flight attendant reported that cleaners were not following social distancing policies. A solution was proposed: cleaners should wait until all passengers have deplaned before boarding and avoid entering the galley while passengers are present.","safety related, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

The FA, who had been on extended leave for over a year due to COVID-19-related schedule reductions, attributed the oversight to the disruption of routine caused by the extended absence. The mistake was discovered during the boarding process of the second flight, when the FA was about to conduct the exit row briefing and realized the omission.

The cleaning crew were at the front door (1Left) trying to get on the plane while the passengers were leaving; and the pilots were also trying to gather their bags and leave. This made the situation very chaotic. I was not aware of it being a 'quick-turn'; as I am always happy to try and help out with the quick-turn cleaning.The cleaners slipped on a few at a time; in between passengers leaving. I saw the two aft crewmembers with their luggage; and moving forward through the cabin; towards me. The cleaners were already onboard; cleaning throughout the plane. I said; 'last but not least!' to the final passenger; thanked her and gathered my belongings. I looked back and only saw the cleaners; and my crew who were almost to me. I didn't see any more passengers and thought we were done. I double-checked my doors and the forward lavatory and stepped off the plane. When the aft crew stepped off; there was a male passenger with them who had been mixed in with the cleaners. He did not have his boarding pass with him. He said he wouldn't leave without it; and that his seat was XX6. He wanted to go look for it himself; but crew went to look. His boarding card was found under his seat.A contributing factor is having so many people onboard/in jetbridge and the cleaning crew coming onboard (sometimes in just sweatshirts; hoodies; jackets; hats; masks; etc.) and mixing in with disembarking passengers; and vice versa.  Flights are more full now; and anyone can be mistaken for a cleaner.Other factors: double-checking the passengers haven't lowered or removed their masks; as they often do now; as they are coming down the aisle towards me and the boarding door. The passengers are trying to look down the aisle and gauge how far we've gotten with the row announcements to deplane. Also; 2-3 pilots using the lavatory; gathering bags and leaving; while passengers are disembarking causes more confusion. All of this; and the extra amount of ground-staff/cleaners onboard and in the jet-bridge in civilian clothing; causes more confusion; multitasking/load at the boarding/deplaning door.I assumed the last passenger I saw; and said goodbye to; was our final passenger onboard.I would not have stepped off the plane had I known there was still one passenger onboard.I will also alert corporate security to this incident; and the added potential for this confusion during disembarkation.,,,,Flight Attendant reported the aircraft cleaners were slipping onboard to clean the aircraft before the passengers were completely off. One last passenger; resembling a cleaner; remained intermixed with crew and cleaners during the crew's exit.,"A conflict occurred between a flight attendant (Party 1) and ground personnel (Party 2) during the disembarkation process of a flight at ZZZ airport. The incident arose due to a ""quick-turn"" operation, where the cleaning crew boarded the aircraft before all passengers had disembarked. This led to confusion as passengers, cleaning staff, and crew members were moving through the cabin simultaneously. The flight attendant was unaware of the situation escalating, as she was focused on her usual duties, including calling rows to deplane and ensuring passenger safety. During the process, she noticed the cleaning crew slipping onboard in casual attire, which blended them in with passengers and crew. Pilots were also leaving the aircraft, adding to the chaos. The flight attendant assumed all passengers had disembarked after seeing the last passenger, who resembled a cleaner, and stepped off the plane. However, a male passenger had remained onboard, intermixed with the cleaning crew and crew members. He was eventually found after his boarding pass was located under his seat. Contributing factors included the quick turnaround procedure, the lack of distinction in clothing between cleaning staff and other individuals onboard, and the presence of multiple ground staff and crew members in the jet-bridge and cabin. The flight attendant noted that double-checking passengers and crew for proper identification could help prevent such confusion in the future. She also expressed concerns about passengers removing or lowering their masks, which could further complicate the deplaning process. As a result of the incident, the flight attendant planned to alert corporate security to the situation and the potential for similar confusion during future disembarkations.","between attendant and other people, operational issues, mask policy"

It was a busy time in the flight deck where I was trying to manage the safety of the push. The FO answered the call to the flight deck from the cabin while I was talking to the ground crew and ramp was talking to our flight and the flight next to us pushing off the gate. The ramp personnel had left several pieces of ground equipment in the way of our push from X1 and we were trying to find out about getting it moved. As all of that is going on the narrative that myself and the FO got from the FA seemed to be one of more a compliance with the mask policy than one of weight and balance. She told us there was a large child sitting in a seat for which they were ticketed next to their mother and the child was having a hard time wearing the mask. The FA told us that the mother was now saying the child was less than 2. The FA believed that the mother was saying the child was less than 2 to skirt our mask policy and we needed to change the count for weight and balance because the child was an infant. I tried to clarify with the FA about the child because it was not clear to me because she was telling me the child was not listed as an infant; had their own seat; and by the FAs thought it was more about the mask. My thinking was that for the child to have that seat a birth date would have to be listed when that seat was purchased. Previously the FAs and the gate agent had reconciled the count; and the FA thought the child was older than 2; so I elected to leave the weight and balance as it stood. We continued to our destination without further incident.It was a busy time in the flight deck when this issue was brought to my attention. After things had calmed down with push I should have checked back with the FA to make sure I was hearing everything she was trying to tell me. Factors for me with my decision making were the high workload at the time; alertness because of the late time of day of the departure and having been scheduled with early AM shows for the three days prior to this event.,,I walked through to do my cabin count and confirmed that I had a child in row XX just as it showed on the sheet. I had already asked the mom to get a mask on the child before we closed the weight/balance. She said the child did not have a mask so I brought her one. After the safety demo I walked through the cabin again for final compliance and saw the child was not wearing a mask. Mom said he had ripped it so I offered to get a new one. She then said that the other FA told her he didn't need one if he was under the age of 2. I was surprised to hear the child was an infant as he was quite large and had walked on board the aircraft by himself. I asked if he was still only 1 and she said he was not yet 2. I alerted the CA that I had possibly made a mistake in the count.  I mistakenly counted an infant as a child. I didn't ask how old the child was; it only came up because of non-compliance with mask policy.I honestly think she claimed the child was an infant in order to avoid dealing with the face mask.In the future I will make sure to ask passengers with small children if they are in fact under the age of 2.,,Air carrier Captain and a Flight Attendant reported a passenger's child was resisting wearing a face mask. After this problem started the parent then stated the child was under 2 and did not need to wear the face mask.,"The incident began when a flight attendant reported a passenger's child resisting the face mask policy. The mother claimed the child was under two years old, exempting the child from the mask requirement. The flight attendant believed this was an attempt to avoid compliance and sought to adjust the weight and balance count. The captain, managing a busy pushback and fatigued from early morning hours, decided to maintain the current count, as the child had a designated seat, suggesting the child was over two. Later, the flight attendant realized she had miscounted the child as a passenger rather than an infant, leading her to alert the captain. She concluded the mother had falsely claimed the child's age. Reflecting on the experience, the flight attendant vowed to verify the age of children in such situations in the future. The outcome was resolved without further incident, with the flight attendant learning to ask passengers about their child's age to ensure accurate counts and compliance.","mask policy, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers"

We called back to the FA's (Flight Attendants) who said they were finishing up service and would come up when they could. When they called up; they gave the code word as normal. I did a positive exchange of controls to the Captain since it was my PF (Pilot Flying) leg. He took controls as normal. Door unlocked and the crew swap went normal. Upon finishing in the lavatory the B FA called up to begin the next crew exchange. She informed me that the CA wanted to use the lavatory too. I was waiting in the galley expecting the A FA to come out so we could do the normal process of me sitting down; getting controls back; getting any flight updates; and then having the FA's call back up so the CA could use the lav. Instead; the flight deck door opened and out walked the CA. No one was at the controls; the A FA was in the process of moving from my seat to the CA seat. I immediately said 'she's supposed to come out first; no one is at the controls'. The CA responded 'oh; right' or something along those lines. The B FA and myself expressed our concerns over the incorrect lavatory exchange procedure. He then proceeded to open the lavatory door. Not go back into the flight deck. I rushed into the flight deck; sat down; got myself situated and locked the door since there was no pilot. I got the aviate; navigate done and now wanted to communicate. I asked the A FA what happened and she said 'I don't really know; he told me to switch seats with him so we squeezed past each other'. I told her that's not normal and that I needed to talk to the CA. The B FA called up; said the code word; and the CA came back in. I talked to him about what happened and he said something like 'oh right; that did seem strange'. I talked to him about the correct procedure which he; I assume; did not know. I told him we had no one at the controls and how dangerous that is. Upon getting to the hotel the FA's asked me if I was going to fill out a report. I called the Pilot Union Professional Standards to get their opinion on the situation. I used this as a teaching moment; however; the whole event should never have happened.,,,,First Officer reported that during a lavatory break; both pilots were out of the cockpit at the same time and the flight attendant was swapping seats in the cockpit; leaving the aircraft uncontrolled.,"The incident occurred during a flight when the First Officer (FO) and Captain (CA) were both absent from the cockpit, leaving the aircraft uncontrolled. The First Officer had informed the Captain of the need to use the lavatory, and the flight attendants (FAs) were expected to manage the cockpit exchange. However, during the crew swap, the flight deck door was opened, and the Captain entered the cockpit while no pilot was seated at the controls. Simultaneously, the A FA was in the process of moving from the FO's seat to the Captain's seat, creating a dangerous situation. The FO returned to the cockpit, retook control, and addressed the unsafe procedure with the Captain. The B FA also expressed concerns about the improper exchange. The incident was reported to the Pilot Union Professional Standards, and the FO used it as a teaching moment to emphasize the importance of proper cockpit procedures.

This was a direct violation of sterile cockpit procedures.

Another FA (Flight Attendant) who was scheduled to work 5/Y/21 ZZZ-ZZZ3-ZZZ2 would replace our A FA. At first the C FA and myself (B FA) thought the A FA would have to DH (Deadhead) on our flight and both the C FA and myself decided to take an earlier van ride to avoid any further distress caused by the A FA. But once C FA and myself realized the A FA was to work ZZZ-ZZZ3-ZZZ2 the C FA and me were relieved and comfortable to take the original van time of XA30am. When van came to pick up the D FA; C FA and myself our original A FA showed up as if nothing happened the previous day. On the previous day once the entire crew arrived to the hotel the A FA verbally attacked the Captain and First Officer. The A FA's hostility towards the pilots made the entire crew uncomfortable. I myself was visibly shaken by the A FA yelling and verbal attack on the pilots. Upon arriving to the airport the A FA walked off without us like the previous two days leaving us behind. When the C FA; D FA and me got to the gate the pilots were waiting in the gate area for us to discuss what we all were going to do as we were all in shock that the A FA was back on the trip without our knowledge of any change. The Captain was still backing up the decision to have the A FA removed but then it came down to what to do. The company put us in a situation making us work with the A FA whose behavior distressed the crew enough to adversely affect our work and well-being at work. The company's decision to have the A FA continue to work the flight created an unhealthy work environment. The crew was nervous and uncomfortable not knowing if there were to be another disturbance. It wasn't as if the flight was only an hour long we were flying across the ocean with nowhere to land if another disturbance were to arise. The C FA; D FA and myself all stayed away from the A FA as much as possible to avoid any further outbursts.,,The day prior after landing in ZZZ and arriving at the hotel; I; as well as the entire crew; had a situation happen with the A Flight Attendant. After speaking with the Chief Pilot as well as the Supervisor in the Operations Center; the decision was made to have the A Flight Attendant removed from her next flight. This decision was reached between the Supervisor and the B FA and C FA. I informed the Supervisor that I even thought I was OK with flying back with the A Flight Attendant. The B and C Flight Attendants were not; and that I was backing them up and would not force or require them to fly with her; against their wishes. The Supervisor said she would pull the A FA from the trip and we would have a new A FA. The situation was so bad that the B FA and C FA did not want to ride in the same van with the A FA the next day. The following day; when we reported for work; we found out that someone had put the original A FA back on the trip without notifying myself or the rest of the crew.I personally found out 45 minutes prior to departure; when I was given the paperwork to review and noticed her name on the Crew sheet. The B; C and D Flight Attendants were extremely upset about the situation and they were put in a very difficult position standing at the gate with over 160 people who were traveling back to the mainland. I asked the 3 Flight Attendants if they were going to be able to work with the A FA and also called the Operations Center to inform the Chief Pilot and the Supervisor about the situation. After the B; C; and D Flight Attendants agreed to work with her and we departed ZZZ. Upon our arrival in ZZZ2; the B FA informed me that it was a very awkward situation.,,Air carrier Captain and a Flight Attendant reported an unsuitable work environment due communication issues between the Captain and a Flight Attendant.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant (FA) and the flight crew due to the FA's hostile behavior toward the pilots, which created an uncomfortable and distressing work environment. On 5/X/21, it was decided to replace the FA for the flight on 5/Y/21, but the replacement was not communicated clearly to the crew. Initially, the crew believed the FA would deadhead (ride without working), but upon discovering she was to work the flight, they were relieved. However, the FA's previous hostile behavior toward the pilots caused the crew significant discomfort, especially after she reappeared on the flight without prior notification. On the day of departure, the crew was shocked to find the FA back on the trip, leading to an awkward and tense atmosphere. The Captain supported removing the FA but faced the dilemma of proceeding with the flight. The company's decision to keep the FA on the flight despite her disruptive behavior created an unhealthy work environment, leaving the crew nervous and unsure about the flight's safety. The flight was completed, but the situation highlighted the need for better communication and conflict resolution. The proposed solution was to honor the initial decision to replace the FA, ensuring a safer and more comfortable work environment for the crew.","crew-related issues, safety related, between attendant and crew"

We were confused by this question because we had been uniformed of any issues regarding our flight. Then he proceeded to tell us that there was an air quality issue with that aircraft. We were even more confused as to why we were not made aware of this issue and wanted confirmation or at least more information about what we were dealing with. He then left us and we began communication with CSS (Cabin Service System); and tried to contact a Supervisor. We then learned that it was in fact our aircraft; and they were now tail swapping it out of service. I am unclear on what we should be doing; if we should be concerned for our health; or be tested? I was under the impression that the Supervisor who first approached us would return with more information or at least confirm that it was our flight. I am not feeling well; but I am unsure now if I was already getting sick; or if it was caused or exasperated by this aircraft. I feel like we have been blindsided with some potentially health threatening news and left with no guidance.We need someone to be following up with us about what's going on and what the exact report entails so we can make an educated decision on how to proceed and weather to be tested or not.,,,,Air carrier flight attendants reported an 'air quality' issue after deplaning the aircraft.,"The flight attendant was approached by a supervisor after landing who informed them about an air quality issue with their aircraft. The attendant was confused as they had no prior notice and sought more information, which they obtained through the Cabin Service System. They learned their aircraft was being replaced. The attendant expressed concerns about their health, unsure if their illness was due to the aircraft or pre-existing. They felt blindsided and requested follow-up and clarification to decide next steps.","operational issues, communication issues, health and medical issues, between attendant and crew"

As soon as I went to the door I look through the peep hole and saw the gate agents eyes. I reach for the flap to open it up to pull up the two red levers and as soon as I reached for the handles the main handle started to lift up and I jerked back. I never gave the gate agent a thumbs up to say that the doors were disarmed and I never went to disarm the R1 door either. I watched the gate agent continue to pull the door and I looked at him and the floor and saw the bag deploy. I immediately called the FO and the Captain of what had transpired. Only the B flight attendant try to console me and informed me to take pictures and fill out an incident report immediately.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that while preparing the doors for arrival; the gate agent opened the door before it was disarmed causing the slide to deploy.,"The incident occurred at ZZZ International Airport when a flight attendant instructed the cabin crew to prepare the doors for arrival. While the flight attendant was at the door, they noticed the gate agent and attempted to open the flap. However, the main handle unexpectedly lifted, causing the flight attendant to jerk back. The flight attendant did not signal the gate agent with a thumbs-up or disarm the R1 door. The gate agent continued to pull the door, causing the slide to deploy. The flight attendant promptly informed the first officer (FO) and the captain about the incident. The B flight attendant attempted to console the affected flight attendant and advised them to take pictures and file an incident report.

They catered the front next. Upon completing catering; and when the R1 door was closed; I noticed that the warning strap was across the window. I immediately called it out and said 'why is that strap across the window'? The door was obviously disarmed as there was no slide deployment. D Flight Attendant was with me. The CSA (Customer Service Associate); who was waiting at the R1 door; then said 'you gave the caters a thumbs up when they knocked and the strapped was attached' which I do not recall doing. D Flight Attendant didn't see the warning strap in the armed position when she boarded the plane either. I immediately moved the warning strap to the disarmed position and noticed that the velcro strap on the extension piece was worn out to the point where the extension would not stay attached. It constantly fell down and hung.I told the First Officer as she was leaving the flight deck that we had an issue with the R1 warning strap. She indicated that they were about to time out and discounted my comment. I made her look at the strap. She came to the door and said 'no; it works; see'. I showed her that 4/5 attempts to place the strap on the Velcro didn't work; it would fall down. She said 'well you gotta talk to the Captain about it' and then entered the bathroom. I then proceeded to talk to the Captain. He stopped me before I even started and said 'if you tell me anything I am obligated to put it in the book; so is this really important?' I said yes; I have an issue with the warning strap. He also indicated that they had a timing issue and couldn't take any delays. I told them that I needed Maintenance. Maintenance came and fixed the strap. I don't know what happened with the strap being across the window in the armed position. I can only speculate that catering attached it while it was hanging down. If it was in place; they shouldn't have opened the door; the CSA should have also said something as she was waiting by L1; apparently watching; and the entire inbound crew should have checked upon deplaning. I find it odd that all of these checks would have been missed. Furthermore; I didn't appreciate being put in a position where I had to make the call if we were going to take a potential delay and possibly cancel the flight due to a timing out issue. My only job is to bring cabin discrepancies to the captain's attention. This was a poor example of CRM. This morning; I had a conversation with the Captain regarding the events yesterday and reiterated what I have written in this [report]; about poor CRM and putting me in an uncomfortable situation. He agreed and said they handled the situation poorly. As we are flying together today on an ETOPS flight to ZZZ; I didn't want to there be any communication issue before we left. Our conversation was pleasant and we cleared the air.,,,,Flight attendant reported a CRM issue developed with the flight deck crew after reporting there was a minor maintenance issue with an aircraft door.,"The incident arose from a maintenance issue with the R1 door warning strap, which the Flight Attendant noticed during cleaning. She reported the strap was improperly positioned and highlighted worn Velcro causing instability. Despite the First Officer and Captain dismissing her concerns initially, the Flight Attendant persisted, leading to Maintenance being called, who subsequently repaired the strap. The situation highlighted shortcomings in CRM, prompting a later discussion between the Flight Attendant and Captain, resulting in a commitment to improve communication and address such issues more effectively.","equipment malfunction, crew-related issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

We left for our next flight. We had a medical incident onboard during the flight. While our CRM was effective; there were many decisions to be made. While our country is currently in a national emergency; any serious medical event leads to uncertainty. All three flight attendants were in constant communication with the Captain. At first we were told no passengers could leave the aircraft when we landed. We had passengers who were aware of the situation and wanted to be involved. Of course our first priority was the safety of our passengers and crew; we also were aware of the effect any decision would have on the company. After discussion with Station Ops and Dispatch; the Captain was instructed to not hold the passengers; and that the aircraft would be cleaned upon arrival. We also spent the entire flight containing the incident so all passengers felt at ease about their safety. I felt we were successful. However; in this coronavirus environment; it was very stressful and we had to remain calm and in control. We were dealing with many different situations and important decisions during the flight.,,After the deplaning of Flight XYZ from ZZZ to ZZZ1; the one of the crew members failed to stay with the XX through passengers. During this flight; we encountered many distractions including a passenger that vomited in the forward lav and we alerted the Captain due to the national concern over the scare of the coronavirus. The crew maintained excellent CRM skills when communicating with the flight deck. The flight deck notified medical service and Dispatch. I was also comforting a woman who was flying to see her gravely ill mother.,,Flight Attendants reported concerns about a sick passenger in their flight.,"The incident was triggered by a medical situation involving a sick passenger on board a flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1. The flight attendants encountered a vomit episode in the forward lavatory, attributed to a national health concern, and promptly alerted the captain. They maintained effective communication with the flight deck, ensuring the situation was managed with care. The crew coordinated with medical services,Dispatch, and Station Ops, leading to the decision to allow passengers to deplane after the aircraft was cleaned. Additionally, the attendants comforted a passenger whose mother was gravely ill. The flight attendants successfully managed the medical incident, ensuring passenger safety and comfort. Passengers were permitted to deplane post-cleaning, adhering to safety protocols amidst the pandemic, thus resolving the situation effectively.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, health and medical issues, between attendant and passengers"

The aircraft was put on a hardstand with no tug where with guidance from the ramp crew we would be able to start both engines and be directed to the movement area of the ramp. After completing the Engine Start Check; I looked over to the Ramper and with their permission; I released the parking brake. I however; did not reengage the parking brake. I then directed the First Officer to start both engines. The number 2 engine was started first. Following the start of the number 1 engine; the First Officer stepped on the brakes and simultaneously engaged the parking brake. This caused the airplane to stop abruptly. I asked the First Officer why he did what he did; and he said that we were moving. I then said that it was my mistake for not having the parking brake engaged; but we were moving slowly and we were far from any equipment and people. I then asked the First Officer two questions Why did he not say to me that the aircraft was moving and I would have applied the brakes and why did he apply both the brakes and the parking brake at the same time ? He said that he was not sure the brakes alone would have stopped the airplane. We then proceeded with the rest of the normal checklists and taxied to the runway and departed. In flight; the Flight Attendant said she was injured from the whiplash and was bruised. She said she may see a doctor upon reaching our destination. At the end of the flight I exchanged my contact information with the Flight Attendant to keep me informed of her physical condition. The whole sequence of events started with me not engaging the parking brake after releasing it for the out time. The threat of not recognizing that we do not have rampers to tell us to reset the brake after push was not addressed during our threat discussion and mitigation. My error was not seeing the airplane moving after the number one engine started and stopping the airplane before the First Officer. The undesired state was the fact that the aircraft moved when it should not have causing potential harm to the ramp crew and outside equipment. The other error I would say was CRM. The First Officer acted in the interest of safety and was the first to recognize the movement of the aircraft. He however over reacted. Based on the fact the airplane was moving slowly and we were far from rampers and equipment; I think he should have told me that we were moving and I would have stopped the airplane. If I did not react he then should have stepped on the brakes. This was the error on CRM our part. After talking to him I found out that he just finished IOE recently and this was his first trip after completing IOE. I think lack of experience in actual line operations caused him to act the way he did. I also should have checked with the Flight Attendant to see how she was doing after the airplane came to a stop. What I learned was to be extra vigilant when you are taxiing out with no towbar from the gate. If we were close to people or equipment; this could have been bad. Addressing ramp operations with no tug driver telling you to 'set the brake' is a threat that we should have discussed and talked about. I also need to be more aware of aircraft (unintentional) movement in all situations and react appropriately.,,,,ERJ145 Captain reported the parked aircraft began rolling on the ramp and the First Officer put the brakes on and the parking brake causing an abrupt stop injuring a Flight Attendant.,"The incident involved an ERJ145 aircraft during its morning flight. The captain released the parking brake but failed to re-engage it, causing the aircraft to move on the ramp after the engines were started. The first officer, noticing the movement, applied both the brakes and the parking brake, resulting in an abrupt stop. A flight attendant sustained injuries from the sudden stop, including whiplash and bruising. The primary causes of the incident were the captain's oversight in not re-engaging the parking brake after releasing it and the first officer's overreaction to the aircraft's movement. The captain acknowledged a lapse in vigilance during ramp operations without proper communication from ground staff and attributed the first officer's actions to his recent completion of initial operating experience (IOE), indicating a lack of line operation experience. The captain learned the importance of being more vigilant when taxiing without a tug and emphasized the need to address ramp operation threats during pre-flight briefings. Additionally, the incident highlighted the importance of effective crew resource management (CRM) and clear communication to prevent similar occurrences.","safety related, crew-related issues, communication issues, training, between attendant and crew"

During the portion of the demonstration where I had to demonstrate the correct use and application of the demonstration oxygen mask; my own face mask was still on while I was demonstrating how to use the oxygen mask. I realize passengers wearing their own masks could think it would be alright to put the oxygen mask over their face mask based on my incorrect demonstration.I went into my trip misinterpreting and misreading communication regarding face masks; which led me to think I would just need to wear my face mask throughout the flight without understanding that there are exceptions and appropriate situations during which to remove the face mask. While completing my safety demonstration; I do not think I realized I was wearing my face mask as I was demonstrating the use of the demonstration oxygen mask. I believe that I was also narrowly focused on keeping up with the demonstration rather than being situationally aware of the fact that I was still wearing a mask as I went into the oxygen mask demonstration.Looking back on this event; I realize I could have been more aware of myself and my surroundings. Before I started the trip; I simply thought that I would just need to wear my mask for the duration of my flights without comprehending that in certain moments of the flight; such as demonstrating correct use of the oxygen mask; that it would be appropriate to remove my mask in order to safely and accurately show its proper use. I plan to be more situationally aware; realizing that I may need to remove my mask for certain tasks.

The Flight Attendant was concerned that passengers would think it would be acceptable to place an oxygen mask over a personal mask.,"The flight attendant was demonstrating the oxygen mask use during the safety briefing while wearing her own face mask, which could have led passengers to misunderstand the correct procedure.

I came forward and asked him if he needed another mask and he said; 'No; I have one.' I asked him to please put it on. He complied until I walked past him; then took it off again. I mentioned it to our Purser. As she was doing cabin compliance checks with me prior to closing main cabin door; Purser again had to ask him to; 'Please put on mask again.' He complied at that point.,,,,Flight Attendant reported catering personnel were not wearing masks; and a non-revenue pilot was not complying with mask usage until pilot was asked twice to comply.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant observed two policy violations during the flight. First, catering personnel were not wearing masks, which contravened company health and safety protocols. Second, a non-revenue pilot was initially non-compliant with mask-wearing requirements. The flight attendant addressed the pilot, who initially refused but complied temporarily. Upon the attendant leaving, the pilot removed his mask again. The Purser intervened, reminding the pilot to wear his mask, to which he finally complied. The catering issue was reported but not resolved during the flight. The result was the pilot's compliance after two reminders, while the catering staff's non-compliance was noted but addressed through reporting.","safety related, crew-related issues, mask policy, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

During the boarding process; the forward FA asked me if it was okay if a passenger moved from the aft of the aircraft to the front of the aircraft. I told her it was okay with me if she was comfortable with doing so; but that was the last communication that we had. After takeoff; I had a sudden realization that the passenger may have moved and that the passenger data/distribution from the auto-closeout may differ from our actual passenger distribution; therefore affecting the accuracy of our weight and balance and manifest. I had the FO call back to the FAs; who confirmed that the passenger did in fact move. After landing; the FA told me that she did not realize that we needed the updated passenger locations for our manifest/weight and balance numbers. This event was caused by a lack of communication by both parties. By not closing the communication loop; there was information that was not conveyed correctly and therefore caused a breakdown. The lack of further information from the FA led me to the assumption that the passenger was not moved; whereas in her opinion I had given her the OK to do whatever she needed to do and there was no need to report back with any changes. Additionally; we are so used to flights being full and the auto-close out process being so automated; that moving passengers is a relatively new occurrence that none of us were necessarily expecting; but that we should be aware of and expect to occur more in the future.During unprecedented times such as these where passenger loads are extremely light and the need to distance passengers may be necessary; and where the weight and balance process is now very streamlined and automated; it would be a great reminder for all crewmembers to be aware of the necessity to maintain accurate record of passenger location; and update the data in the MCDU to reflect where passengers are actually seated if it differs from the auto close-out data. Explaining to flight attendants the importance of this communication (having an accurate manifest and subsequently weight and balance data) may help all parties understand the importance of making these changes. I personally plan on briefing the crew during particularly empty flights; that they need to report any passenger seating changes to me prior to departure.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported that the aircraft departed with passenger distribution data different from the actual distribution due to one passenger changing seats.

The cause was a lack of communication between the flight crew and the flight attendant. During boarding, the forward flight attendant had asked the Captain if a passenger could move from the aft to the front, receiving permission. However, there was no follow-up communication. After takeoff, the Captain realized the passenger had moved, leading to discrepancies in weight and balance data. The flight operations officer (FO) confirmed the move with the flight attendants. Post-landing, the flight attendant explained she hadn't realized the need to update the data. The proposed solution is for the Captain to brief the crew on the importance of accurate passenger data and communication, especially on low-load flights.","communication issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

I was also hearing that passenger was being disruptive.One of my flight attendants had a concern of this passenger still being contagious and being a disruptive passenger. With the passenger still being at the gate I started to receive more information I was told to contact MedLink. Turns out that the gate had already been in touch with MedLink and the passenger had already been cleared by MedLink. As for the pre-existing medical condition; the passenger told the gate of not wearing a mask because it causes asthma attacks. I verified this to be a possibility with MedLink on my side.As for the disruptive behavior I spoke with the station manager and he informed me that the passenger was being cooperative and only just understandably a little frustrated. I asked him if he thought passenger would be an issue in flight and he indicated that he did not believe that to be the case.

Passenger X was upset because a passenger in front of her had removed their mask while drinking coffee, which she perceived as a violation of mask-wearing rules. The flight attendant explained that it is permitted for passengers to lower their masks while eating or drinking. Despite this explanation, Passenger X remained confused and continued to express her concerns.

The flight attendant attempted to address Passenger X's frustration by explaining that the flight was weight-restricted, which limited their ability to accommodate seat changes. The attendant also had the Customer Service Supervisor intervene to assist in resolving the situation. However, after the aircraft took off, Passenger X became upset again when two gentlemen in another row (row Y) took their seats, which had been moved at the gate. Passenger X questioned why she could not move while the gentlemen could, despite the gate staff having already adjusted their seating.

During the interaction, Passenger X raised her voice and became increasingly confrontational, citing concerns about her dying father and her fear of COVID-19 exposure. The flight attendant reassured her that the situation was being monitored and that no policy violations were occurring, but Passenger X dismissed the attendant's statements, stating she was unhelpful and demanded the attendant's name.

I told him that we were about to land and that he needed to return to his seat.  He wasn't happy; but complied.  After arriving at the gate; he came back to use the lav again.  The PIC called and asked if we (the FAs) would ask him to stay seated until everyone else had deplaned so someone to talk with him.  I asked him and he was very unhappy and agreed while yanking off his mask. I must have looked surprised because; after looking back at my face; he quickly put his mask back on.  He deplaned last and a [customer service agent] was there to meet him.  The other FA informed me that; when he first boarded the plane; he had immediately used the forward restroom.  That totaled 9 trips to the lav in 1.5-2 hrs and many requests to keep his mask on.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger using the restroom numerous times; coughing and having to constantly be reminded to wear a mask.,"During a flight, a **Flight Attendant (FA)** reported an incident involving a passenger, referred to as Passenger X, who exhibited unusual behavior. Passenger X used the restroom a total of **nine times** within a span of **1.5 to 2 hours**, which raised concerns among the crew and other passengers. Upon entering the restroom, Passenger X was heard coughing heavily, to the point of gagging, which worried two other passengers. When asked about his condition, he initially claimed it was due to allergies but later stated he was not feeling well because he had not eaten breakfast. The FA provided snack bags to all passengers and kept a close eye on Passenger X throughout the flight. Additionally, Passenger X was repeatedly reminded to wear his mask properly. The FA noted that he was reading or digging through his bags, which may have contributed to the need for mask reminders. The FA informed the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) about the situation, and the PIC requested that the FA check if there was a way to take Passenger X's temperature. Since the crew did not have a thermometer, the PIC suggested contacting a customer service agent to meet the flight. After landing, the PIC instructed the FA to ask Passenger X to remain seated until all other passengers had deplaned, so that someone could speak with him privately. Passenger X complied but was visibly unhappy and removed his mask in frustration. After noticing the FA's surprise, he quickly put the mask back on. Passenger X was the last to deplane and was met by a customer service agent at the gate. The FA later reported that Passenger X had used the forward restroom immediately after boarding the plane, adding to the total of nine restroom visits. His behavior created disturbances and safety concerns during the flight.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, emergency, operational issues, health and medical issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people"

He said he would call Maintenance. I'm not sure whom he contacted but they told him 'If the FAs (Flight Attendants) need to use it; they just turn it on; it's fine.' I explained how the ELT should work and he directed me to move the switch to the ARM position. After the ELT's quick self-test it checked out as ready to operate.I am concerned that however long the ELT had been OFF that nobody noticed during their prefight equipment check. I also feel that Tech Ops/Flight Ops should have a better working knowledge of the equipment; or be able to quickly reference the information. Had I not questioned it; the equipment would have continued; as it apparently had already; to remain OFF.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported ELT in the OFF position.,"An incident occurred when a flight attendant discovered the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) in the OFF position during an equipment check, which should have been ARMED. The attendant notified the captain, who contacted Maintenance. Maintenance responded by advising the captain that the ELT could be turned on if needed, and the captain subsequently moved the switch to ARM after the attendant explained its operation. The ELT functioned correctly after a self-test. The incident raised concerns about the lack of awareness during pre-flight checks and the need for improved technical knowledge or quick reference resources among Maintenance and Flight Operations. Without the attendant's intervention, the ELT would have remained OFF, posing a potential safety risk.","safety related, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

I don't Remember the gate. It was my leg to fly to ZZZ1. We had some weather approaching from the south. Me and the Captain knew it was going to be a quick taxi being we were going to takeoff XXR. So we did preflight check at the gate and then when the flight attendants were ready they closed the flight deck door and then locked it. When the ramp crew was ready we did the push checklist. We started both engines as me and the Captain talked about because of the short taxi. Then we did the taxi check before we moved the aircraft due to the short taxi. We then taxied towards Runway XXR and during that time we did the before takeoff checklist. I'm pretty sure I called the back and told the flight attendants and cabin we were next for takeoff. After going through the checklist and noticed that the flight attendants did not call us. So I called back there to see if they were ready and from what I heard they were. It was not as clear as normal because of the wearing of the mask for COVID. We then closed the before takeoff checklist before departure and was cleared to takeoff. We then arrived at ZZZ1 with no issues. Then we landed and passengers deplaned; someone getting off the plane said something to me but was not able to hear being she was walking and far away with her mask on. Then the forward Flight Attendant came to the front and spoke to the Captain saying they had a passenger was not listening to the rules with the mask compliance. That's all I heard about.

They completed their preflight checks and communicated with the flight attendants, who closed and locked the flight deck door. The crew initiated engine start and taxi procedures, conducting a before-takeoff checklist. During this process, the flight crew attempted to confirm the flight attendants' readiness but received unclear responses due to mask usage, leading to a possible misunderstanding. The crew proceeded with takeoff, which was uneventful, and the flight landed safely. Upon deplaning, a flight attendant informed the Captain about a passenger's mask noncompliance. The flight crew continued their journey without further issues. However, the following day, the flight crew was informed of their removal from the rest of the pairing due to the flight attendants not being properly seated for departure the previous day. The First Officer was unaware of any such issue until the removal was communicated. The incident stemmed from a communication障碍 due to mask usage, leading to a misunderstanding about the flight attendants' readiness. As a result, the flight crew was removed from subsequent duties.","between attendant and crew, safety related, operational issues"

The passenger had a coach seat assignment but had taken a seat in a main cabin extra row. Our #1 FA asked him to move back into an unoccupied seat a few rows back. The passenger got verbally abusive and made physical threats peppered with loud obscene language. Our FAs did not feel safe and specifically because of the physical threats. Over the years I have learned to trust our FAs when it comes to passenger relations. Every time they've flagged a passenger as a potential problem they are almost always correct and the passenger becomes a worse problem airborne.

Interacting with masked people is a barrier to clear communication and misunderstandings can easily flare up into confrontations. That being said; our co-workers deserve to be treated with respect and verbal/physical threats will not be tolerated.We have a lot more new customers flying these days due to the decreased fare prices. Customers who have never flown before are unfamiliar with societal rules we crew members take for granted. This can lead to misunderstandings and inappropriate confrontations.

The flight attendant emphasized trusting their colleagues' judgment in passenger relations, noting that such incidents often escalate in flight. The captain suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic might have contributed to the stress and potential misunderstandings due to communication barriers caused by mask-wearing. Additionally, the captain highlighted the challenge of accommodating new, inexperienced passengers who may be unfamiliar with airline rules, proposing a video guide for new customers to watch before boarding as a potential solution.

The Y year old doesn't have to wear one.  This FA obtained two for her from the galley. She had found hers. The Y year old yelled out he wants one so was given one. During service; Passenger X was not wearing a mask. She was informed again that the masks must be worn through duration of flight as it is policy. She responded 'How come nobody at the gate told me that. I have a medical condition. She was informed that when she booked the travel; a notice comes out saying that you must go to the gate over an hour before the flight and speak to a medical doctor that will determine if you can be excused. She did not respond. Her daughter was informed that she must wear the mask. The mother says she keeps breaking it. She was informed of the policy and lack of compliance on other flights have forced planes back to the gate and we don't want that to happen here so we need the masks on for the whole flight. The FA checked and advised the mother that Y year olds must wear the mask. The X year old responded 'He's Z [years old]!' Even more so I said. The mother was shown the mask policy and told that she has been told at least three times that this is mandatory. This FA walked away to give her time to read it. It was explained to the children that many people have gotten sick and this is important to keep everyone safe. We know it's hard but it is for everyone's safety.  The mother got up to place mask on child saying good luck with that. She continued to get up several times to attend to the children. The CA was informed.

The conflict arose when the mother and her children were found not wearing face masks, despite the flight's policy requiring all passengers to do so throughout the journey. The mother initially claimed she was unaware of the mask policy and cited a medical condition as a reason for non-compliance. The flight attendant provided masks from the galley, but the mother repeatedly refused to comply, arguing that her child kept breaking the mask. The attendant explained the policy, the importance of safety, and the potential consequences of non-compliance, such as the flight being delayed. The mother also mentioned she wasn't informed at the gate, to which the attendant explained the procedure for medical exemptions. Despite these discussions, the mother continued to refuse, leading the flight attendant to inform the captain, who made a public announcement about the mask policy. The mother's resistance persisted, with her son eventually stating he found the mask enjoyable, while she loudly disagreed. The mother's refusal to comply with the mask policy led to the incident being reported. The flight completed its journey, but the mother's actions highlighted a compliance issue that the crew had to address during the flight.","mask policy, safety related, communication issues, operational issues, between attendant and passengers"

They explained they were unable to call an FA because they saw this while standing in the aisle several rows behind these people as all passengers waited to deplane. The two passengers were able to exit the aircraft before the other passengers could notify me. I assured them the plane was terminated and would be sanitized for the evening and we agreed that the only thing remaining we could do about it was to notify Operations and request they inform the cleaners of the location to take extra precautions to protect themselves and to sanitize that area thoroughly. The blood [was] intentionally smeared into an X shape on the wall. I presumed the blood came from tearing open a scab or some other small wound. It was a clearly visible amount but didn't indicate heavy bleeding.By the time [deplaning] was complete and I could go to row XX; most of the moisture from the saliva and nasal secretions had dried and was barely visible; only the blood stood out. Without their notification; and even with the easily visible blood; it would have been impossible to realize the extent to which they had contaminated every possible surface. It would have dried completely had we taken the time to tidy the aircraft first. In our PA about passenger compliance we emphasize seat belts and smoking and perhaps that is outdated and detracts from where the emphasis currently should lie. We state federal law prohibits tampering with a lav smoke detector; perhaps we have a law that prohibits passenger misconduct and could be stated in such a way that explains the criminality (if any) to such behavior. I do not believe those passengers believed they could face any consequence for these actions. Regardless of taking place during a pandemic; at any time this behavior poses a risk to other passengers; crew; and employees.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that two passengers were observed spitting; and wiping their saliva and blood over their entire seating area.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and two passengers (Party2) in seats XX5 and XX6.

The two passengers exited the aircraft before the other passengers could notify the flight attendant. The flight attendant terminated the flight and informed Operations to request cleaners to sanitize the affected area thoroughly. The blood was smeared in an X shape on the wall, likely from a small wound. The flight attendant noted that without the passengers' notification, the extent of the contamination would have gone unnoticed, as the saliva and secretions had dried by the time she could inspect the area. The flight attendant reflected on the need for updated passenger announcements to emphasize the seriousness of such misconduct and the potential consequences. No immediate solution was proposed for the passengers' actions, but the flight attendant emphasized the importance of addressing such behavior to protect other passengers, crew, and employees.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, health and medical issues, between attendant and passengers"

I called F/D and let them know of the situation and asked to hold pushback until aft FAs determined whether Passenger X should continue on the flight. Passenger X complied initially and we departed without further issue.During cruise F/A B communicated to me that he had asked Passenger X several times to keep his mask on - as he was not eating or drinking. I went aft and asked Passenger X to wear his mask as well; which he had stuffed into his pocket. He was visibly annoyed and didn't initially comply. As he was connecting on another flight; we also notified pilots of the situation. Passenger X; was non-compliant with face mask.Better policy/procedure is needed between FA; Pilot; and station workgroups and their roles. It doesn't feel particularly safe to send someone who is knowingly non-compliant onto another crew or CSA.,,During boarding I observed Passenger X; without his face mask on and asked him to please pull his mask up; which he did. After the demo as I walked to the back; I observed Passenger X with his face mask down again. I told him to put it up. And then I reminded him that he had agreed to wear a face mask is a condition of flying with us this evening. I told him I was not playing games. I told him; this could jeopardize his ability to fly with this airline in the future. I asked him if he understood and he said he did. Later on; after the service; I was going through the cabin picking up trash and observed Passenger X without a face mask. It was not on his face around his neck. It was nowhere to be seen. I looked him squarely in the face. He saw me looking at him and made no move to put his face mask on again. I called the A FA and told her about [the] issue.

Lead FA (Purser) stated that none of the FAs were comfortable coming up to the Cockpit unless the remaining pilot (in the cockpit) wore a face covering. As he really needed to use the Lav; the FO consented to the FA's request and then told me (the Captain) of the FA's request. This is the first time in my XX+ years at airline and XY+ years as a Captain; that I've had a FA hold me hostage to get a Lav break. The FA requested that the pilot remaining in the cockpit wear a face covering in the cockpit while the other pilot was absent from the cockpit on the Lav break. I never wear a face covering in the cockpit; while flying the aircraft; especially with the other pilot absent from the cockpit.If it's not already obvious; let me restate that the FARs prohibit the use of a face covering (or the wearing of a beard) that would prevent a proper seal of the O2 mask. At FL400 and a TUC (Time of Useful Consciousness) of 15 seconds; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to find out that your O2 mask doesn't work with a face covering. As the FO left the cockpit; and me wearing a face covering; per the FA's request; ATC gave us a vector off course and a speed reduction for traffic. I replied to ATC; but they couldn't hear my boom mike through the face covering. At FL400; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to find out ATC can't hear your boom mike through the face covering. Before she left; I told the Lead FA that I would be writing a report and she said something through her face covering that I couldn't hear. At FL400; with the other pilot absent from the cockpit; is NOT the time to be unable to communicate with the only other person in the cockpit.Face coverings are UN-SAFE while taxing; flying; or maneuvering the airplane. They fog up my glasses which I am required to wear; they prevent me from communicating clearly with ATC; the other pilot or with the FA when the other pilot is absent from the cockpit.After the flight; we had a long debrief with the FAs. Company COVID-19 face covering information DOES NOT address the wearing of a face covering while operating an aircraft. The FAs on this flight; believed I was operating the aircraft in disregard of the Federal Aviation Regulations and in direct violation of Company Policy. It was unclear to these FAs; who gets to tell who must wear a face covering while operating an aircraft. None of these FAs seemed to understand who the Pilot-In-Command (PIC) is when operating an aircraft.In the masked de-brief; they were argumentative and confrontational. They thought that the remaining pilot on the cockpit was required to wear an O2 mask anytime the other pilot is absent the cockpit. It is very difficult to discuss face coverings with a FA who's been told that everyone is required to wear a face covering at all times while on an aircraft or on company property. The FAs do not understand the problems caused by face coverings in the cockpit (the O2 mask; Pilot to Pilot or Pilot to ATC communications issues; or Eye Glass fogging). The FAs believe that they can tell the Captain how to operate an aircraft in direct violation of the FARs; safety procedures and common sense. This has to stop. The Company must tell all employees; but especially FAs; that the Captain is in command; that face coverings cause safety issues in the cockpit and that pilots are NOT required (in fact; are discouraged from wearing) face coverings while operating an aircraft.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported that the flight attendants were not comfortable coming into the flight deck while the pilot was on a restroom break; until the remaining pilot was wearing a face mask. Reporter described safety concerns with having to wear a face mask in the cockpit.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and flight attendants regarding the safety protocols for wearing face coverings in the cockpit. Here's a concise summary: During the flight, the First Officer requested a Lavatory break. The Lead Flight Attendant insisted that no flight attendant would enter the cockpit unless the remaining pilot wore a face covering. The Captain complied but was angered, feeling it was unprecedented and unsafe. The Captain highlighted safety issues with face coverings in the cockpit, citing potential problems with oxygen masks, communication with ATC, and fogging of glasses. These concerns were particularly acute at FL400, where quick response times are critical. The use of a face covering muffled communication, leading to difficulties in contacting ATC and the Lead FA, further complicating the situation. Post-landing, the debrief with FAs became confrontational. FAs believed the Captain was violating safety protocols by not wearing a face covering and didn't understand the Captain's authority as PIC. The Captain emphasized the need for clear company policies on face coverings in the cockpit, noting that current COVID-19 guidelines don't address this specific scenario. They stressed the importance of recognizing the PIC's authority and the hazards face coverings pose in the cockpit environment. In conclusion, the incident underscored the need for improved communication, policy clarity, and understanding of safety protocols among all crew members.","safety related, crew-related issues, mask policy, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

He locked the back lavatory (put a sticker out of service) on the back lavatory door. It is so wrong. I could not fix this problem. He was very condescending.

FA1 locked the lavatory and blocked the jumpseat area with a curtain, citing discomfort near passengers. FA2 objected, explaining that such measures were only justified for wheelchair passengers. FA1 contacted the captain, attributing the issue to FA2. Despite FA2 informing the captain, FA1 persisted. FA2 suggested that if FA1 felt unsafe, he should not be there, emphasizing the need to ensure passenger comfort.

I conveyed what had happed to both FA A and the CA.  Shortly after 10;000 feet as I was heading forward to retrieve a set of headphones for another guest; as I walk by; I find her laying across XX1 and 2 with her head propped up on her book bag on the aisle arm rest; head hanging over into the aisle without a mask.  I tried rousing her quietly with no response from her and then gently tapped her on the shoulder and her exclaiming; 'What?!  What do you want?'  I politely asked her to please put her mask on and cover both her nose and mouth as required and to please ensure her seatbelt remained fastened while the seatbelt sign was on as we were still ascending.  She begrudgingly complied as she continued to complain and others around her asked her to wear it as well.  During service; once again; Passenger X had her mask below her chin as she sat with her foot propped up in the seat and was painting her toenails.  I politely asked her again to comply with the mask requirement and to please not polish her toenails as the fumes were offensive to those around her.  She denied painting her toenails (with polish in an opened [bottle and] nail polish remover pad in hand). I explained to her once again that wearing a mask is a requirement that she had been made aware of prior to boarding and that it wasn't fair to the other passengers and crew on board as everyone else was diligent in complying. I also made her aware that she had been informed several times.  As I started to walk forward to let FA A know what had transpired.  We called the CA and let him know that we were doing and to be prepared in the event that the situation escalated.  The guest in front of her Passenger Y asked if there was something more I could do or move her when suddenly her voice level became elevated and she said 'There!  I pulled the mask up and I have a headache so go away!' Subsequently we (FA A and myself) asked the Passenger Y if he would be more comfortable in another seat and he accepted.  Passenger Y and several other guests commended us for how we handled the situation.  Passenger Y gave his permission for this airline to contact him regarding the situation and events. Passenger X complied for the rest of the flight.  Upon final compliance before landing; Passenger X was asked by both FA A and myself to again stow her bags which she finally did by tossing and kicking them under the seat.  Upon landing she quickly stood; gathered her belongings and hurried off of the plane before rows in front of her stood.  Although we understand the importance of wanting to retain customer loyalty; this kind of behavior should not be tolerated for the sake of one over an entire cabin of guests and employees.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger did not comply with wearing a face mask during flight and exhibited other non-compliant behavior.,"A flight attendant encountered a passenger who repeatedly failed to comply with mask-wearing regulations and other cabin behavior guidelines. The passenger, identified as X, was reminded multiple times before takeoff to stow her belongings and wear her mask. During the flight, Passenger X disregarded these instructions, lying across seats and removing her mask. She also engaged in painting her toenails, despite being asked to stop due to fumes bothering others. When addressed, Passenger X became confrontational, raising her voice and refusing to comply. The flight attendant and crew, including the Chief Attendant, took steps to mitigate the situation, offering alternative seating to affected passengers. Passenger X eventually complied with mask requirements for the remainder of the flight but quickly left the aircraft upon landing.

I never stopped the demonstration. But I am supposed to if everyone isn't in their seats. I should follow what I know is right and stop the safety demonstration. Even if it is a deadheading pilot and not worry about any repercussions from the Captain even though he didn't act in a manner that was supportive of my and everyone's safety.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a deadheading pilot pushed his way past her while doing the safety demonstration to use the lavatory and coughed profusely.,"The incident occurred during the safety demonstration when a deadheading pilot abruptly left his seat, pushing the flight attendant aside to use the lavatory. The pilot exhibited signs of distress, with a flushed face, watery eyes, and severe coughing. Upon noticing this, the flight attendant informed the captain, who instructed her that no action would be taken unless the pilot removed his mask. The pilot remained in the lavatory throughout the demonstration. Faced with the situation, the flight attendant felt compelled to halt the safety demonstration to prioritize passenger safety, despite the captain's stance, as stopping the demo was her responsibility to ensure everyone's well-being.","between attendant and crew, health and medical issues, mask policy, disruptive, operational issues"

When he came out of the lavatory; I asked him to put on his mask; he replied; 'Why? Is something going on that I should know about?' and walked to his seat; he did not put his mask on. I went over to his seat and asked him to put on his mask again for everyone's safety. He replied; 'Why? Am I not wearing it right?' I responded that the mask needed to cover his mouth and nose. He then grabbed the mask and broke the string; he said; 'Damn it; I guess I can't wear it now.' I told him we have more masks and went in the back to the galley and grabbed another mask for him. After handing it to him; I left.  Later on in the flight after my final descent announcement; I was passing through the cabin doing my final sweep and saw he was still not wearing the mask. I asked him again to put it on; that it is a requirement to wear a mask while on the aircraft. He told me he can't breathe with it on and unless I had a ventilator he wasn't going to wear it. At this point; I felt that it wasn't constructive anymore and he wasn't going to comply; I didn't know what else to do so I left.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that a passenger refused to wear a face mask during the flight.,"During a flight, a passenger refused to wear a face mask properly despite being prompted by a flight attendant. The passenger initially disregarded the request, arguing that there was no need to wear the mask. After being reminded again, he damaged the mask and claimed he could not wear it. The flight attendant offered an additional mask, but the passenger continued to refuse, stating he would not wear it unless a ventilator was available. Despite multiple attempts to address the situation, the passenger remained non-compliant, and the flight attendant was unable to resolve the issue.

I called Captain and asked him to let me check on situation and I would call him right back after.  He said OK. I went back and asked passenger if they were in the exit row or did they move and she said she moved because she wanted a window seat. I explained I needed her to move back to her original seat as we had not briefed her for the exit row. I told her I would come back and explain more about why after we got in the air.  She moved back. I went back to my FWD jumpseat and called the Captain to tell him we were secure and passenger was back in her seat. AFT FA made a PA telling passenger of need to keep masks on then told me that same passenger had removed hers. As he walked up during our service in flight he said he thought he noticed a beer bottle on her seat tray. I asked him if he wanted me to check and he said yes. I walked back and there was an open beer bottle can on her tray. I asked her what was in the bottle and asked if it was an X brand beer and alcohol. She said yes and I told her she could not have her alcohol on board.  She asked why but said OK; and I took it and showed the aft FA in the galley then threw it away and immediately called the flight deck. The FO apparently answered and I told him the same passenger that had tried to move in to the exit row and we had a mask issue with had an open beer on her tray that we took from. I told him she did not appear drunk as she was answering my questions clearly and cognitively; but had a little smart attitude.  During the rest of the flight I continued to collect trash in the aisle about every 10 minutes to check on her. It seemed she had 2 other friends in the exit row area that she was talking to that she kept looking back at then looked at us to see if we were watching but she didn't seem to be doing anything else wrong until she removed her mask then the aft FA gave her a warning and she kept her mask on after that except for drinking some water the other FA said he thought it was.  After we deplaned another passenger in seat Z4; said as he deplaned - Do you want to talk to me? I said yes the Captain would because at that point I wasn't sure what he meant but he had given me eye contact during the flight like he did not know what to think of the passenger.  Another passenger deplaned who had been sitting in A2 was not happy with the passenger either apparently. Passenger in Z4 told the Captain on the jet bridge that she had been saying swear words and how she was going to write a letter to airline and what she was going to do the other FA and I?  The passenger had never slurred words or acted incoherent so there was never a sign of intoxication to us. I explained that again to the Captain as well.

The passenger's inappropriate comments were reported by other passengers post-flight. The result included confiscation of the beer, a mask warning, and subsequent reports of the passenger's behavior, with no signs of intoxication observed.

I did say it politely though.He also did not have his nose covered on his way to the bathroom. He also mentioned it to me after in a rather upset manner that I woke him up but it was okay that everyone else had theirs down because they were eating and drinking.

I stand by it because right now safety and health care [are] the same thing and I'm protecting everyone when it comes to making sure masks are worn correctly.

The attendant approached the sleeping passenger politely to remind him to cover his mouth and nose, waking him up. The passenger later went to the bathroom but was still non-compliant, with his nose uncovered. Upon returning, he expressed his upset, arguing that others were eating and drinking, so it was acceptable. The flight attendant reiterated the importance of mask compliance for safety, but the passenger dismissed her explanation and remained non-compliant. The attendant stood by her actions, emphasizing the necessity of adhering to health and safety protocols.

FA A did not allow passengers to pass through the forward galley during boarding to expedite the boarding process. FA B tried his best to direct traffic at the 1L door. Due to FA A blocking traffic from coming through the forward galley passengers were only able to get to their seat using the aircraft left aisle until they reached the mid galley. This caused a delay for departure. We still had bags out and overhead bins open when the FA A made the PA that the boarding door had been closed; and to arm our doors. I ran forward and told her we were still getting bags put away; and still had open overhead bins. She stated the agent had closed the door. I stated that she should have told them we were not ready to close the boarding door. After that; all FAs armed doors and tried to get all bags and overhead bins taken care of as quickly as possible. We then felt ground movement. I looked out of the window. We had started moving backwards. We had not received an All Call; and we were still trying to get all bags stowed and overhead bins closed. I (FA C) grabbed the phone at my jumpseat and made an All Call. The FA A hung up the phone almost as soon as she answered. She simply stated her name. I stated my name and that I initiated an All Call since she had not and we were pushing back. Note that this also means she had closed the flight deck door. If the flight deck door was closed then the flight deck must have thought we were seated and stowed; when in fact we were not. After she answered her phone and stated her name; and I stated I had started the All Call; she hung up. The rest of us proceeded with stating our doors had been armed and cross checked. My phone then rang. I answered the phone stating my name. FA A stated she was now performing the All Call. I stated we had just done the All Call. She then hung up her phone. FA A also would not make the COVID-19/mask announcement. FA D made the required PA. FA A had stated to FA E that she knew one of us (FA D or myself) would make it; since she was not going to make it. We did not know she was not going to make the PA and waited until he made the decision to just make the PA since we were not hearing it being made by her.The FA A needs to be spoken to about the FARs that were violated; as well as procedures that MUST be followed. This created a very chaotic and potentially hazardous environment for all on board. Passengers and crew.,,,,Flight Attendant reported communication and procedural issues experienced with another Flight Attendant.,"The incident involved a conflict between two flight attendants (FA A and FA B) during the boarding and pre-flight preparation process. The conflict arose due to discrepancies in their communication and adherence to established procedures. FA A restricted passengers from using the forward galley during boarding, causing congestion and delays. FA B attempted to manage the boarding process at the 1L door but was hindered by FA A's actions, leading to a slower boarding procedure. After boarding was underway, FA A prematurely closed the boarding door and armed the doors without ensuring all bags and overhead bins were secured. When FA C, another flight attendant, attempted to address this by making an All Call, FA A hung up the phone and failed to complete the required COVID-19/mask announcement. FA A admitted to knowing that another flight attendant would have to make the announcement, as she was not going to do so. This resulted in confusion and a potentially hazardous situation, as the flight deck door was closed, creating the impression that the cabin was ready for takeoff when it was not. The incident concluded with FA A's alleged procedural violations and communication issues being brought to light, necessitating corrective action, such as addressing the FARs and procedures she may have violated. The situation created a chaotic and unsafe environment for both passengers and crew.","crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, safety related, between attendant and crew"

The Gate Agent had not briefed the flight attendants on any exemptions; so I looked on EFB and just saw an Infant in XX3. I asked the Forward FA to ask the Gate Agent who was standing in the galley if we had any late exemptions and he advised no. Gate Agent came to back of plane to talk to Passenger X and advised him he would have to wear a mask since there was not an exemption. Passenger X advised he had gotten an exemption in ZZZ1 on way to ZZZ and showed a boarding pass that in ink was written exemption from mask but we had no idea who wrote it. Passenger X then pulled out a letter that only stated he was disabled and that he gets paid a certain amount. Gate Agent was advising it was OK with him for Passenger X to go; but I said no we need to talk to the Captain in regards to this. We went to the Captain who made a phone call and was told passenger would need to get an exemption for our flight. The Gate Agent at that time went to gate to meet a Supervisor and see if anything was in the record. When he came back suddenly there was a record for the passenger with the exemption of taking mask off for XX minute intervals. I then looked at my EFB and now it showed a wheelchair where the infant had been and the infant moved to XX4. We closed up after advising Passenger X of the exemption and the XX minutes only. During the 2 hour 30 minute flight we had to tell Passenger X at least 4 times that he had to put mask on and when he did we had to tell him over his nose and mouth not just his chin.

The incident began when the flight attendant noticed Passenger X without a mask during boarding. The Gate Agent, who had not briefed the flight crew on any exemptions, initially denied knowing about one. Passenger X presented a boarding pass with an ink-written exemption and a letter stating his disability. Despite the Gate Agent's initial approval, the flight attendant insisted on consulting the Captain, who confirmed that an exemption was needed specifically for the flight. The Gate Agent then retrieved a record confirming the exemption, allowing Passenger X to remove the mask for short periods. However, during the 2.5-hour flight, Passenger X repeatedly ignored the mask policy, often only covering his chin instead of his nose and mouth. Compounding the issue, Passenger X's disruptive two-year-old child coughed and sneezed throughout the flight, and Passenger X cited anxiety as a reason for non-compliance. Despite the exemption, Passenger X showed total disregard for the mask rules, requiring multiple reminders from the flight crew. An exemption was granted for Passenger X to remove the mask for specified intervals. However, Passenger X failed to adhere to the exemption, leading to repeated reminders and non-compliance during the flight.","mask policy, disruptive, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people"

I informed both passengers that the Captain and Gate Agent will be informed of this refusal and that the appropriate actions would be taken against him for not complying with the mask policy. Upon arrival the Gate Agent spoke to the party involved and the man in question refused to speak and the woman who assisted stated that he refused to wear the mask because 'he couldn't hear' and that he was 'sleeping'. Neither of these statements are true.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger refused to comply with the face mask policy.,"The incident involved a flight attendant and a passenger on board a flight. During the final descent, the flight attendant noticed that the passenger in seat XX1 was not wearing a face mask, had his seatbelt unfastened, and had his seat reclined. The flight attendant politely requested compliance with the mask policy and instructed the passenger to prepare for landing by buckling his seatbelt and adjusting his seat to an upright position. The passenger refused, shaking his head, putting his fingers in his ears, and repeatedly saying, ""No, I am not going to wear my mask right now."" Despite the flight attendant's repeated requests, the passenger ignored her instructions. The passenger's flightmate intervened, urging him to comply with the seatbelt and seat position requirements. The passenger, however, continued to refuse, stating he would not wear his seatbelt and wanted to go to the bathroom. The flight attendant asked the flightmate if the passenger was okay, to which she responded, ""Yes,"" but then firmly instructed the passenger to buckle his seatbelt and adjust his seat. The passenger eventually complied with the seatbelt and seat position but verbally refused to wear the mask. The flight attendant then requested the flightmate's assistance in persuading the passenger to put on his mask, explaining that refusal to comply with the mask policy could result in the passenger being banned from flying. Despite these efforts, the passenger persisted in his refusal. The flight attendant informed both passengers that the Captain and Gate Agent would be notified of the passenger's refusal to comply with the mask policy, and appropriate actions would be taken. Upon arrival, the Gate Agent spoke to the passenger, who refused to engage in conversation. The flightmate, however, stated that the passenger refused to wear the mask because he ""couldn't hear"" and was ""sleeping."" These claims were later determined to be untrue. The incident resulted in the passenger's refusal to comply with the mask policy, leading to potential consequences such as being banned from future flights. No resolution was explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that the passenger's actions would be addressed by the authorities.","mask policy, between attendant and passengers, crew-related issues, operational issues"

The B FA asked her to put her mask back on. She complied; but later during  the flight the same child and adult accompanying her consciously removed their mask despite being told 5 times that they were required. However this was a XX minute flight so I informed the Captain on arrival that there was an issue regarding a noncompliant passenger. He agreed that getting a Supervisor was needed.  I let the agent who met the flight know that we needed a Supervisor. She sent the Station Manager before the deplaning process happened. The Captain made an announcement to re-inform the passengers that masks are required throughout the flight. The same passenger proceeded to deplane without a mask while the Captain observed and then she hurried up and put it back on.  Nevertheless; the manager informed us that her record would be flagged and she had a conversation with her.

The FA noticed a child, who was required to wear a mask, without one and requested the child to put it on. Initially, the child complied, but later, both the child and the adult accompanying her removed their masks despite being reminded multiple times. The flight was short, so the FA informed the captain upon arrival about the passenger's non-compliance. The captain agreed that a supervisor was needed and made an announcement reiterating the mask requirement. Despite these efforts, the passenger deplaned without a mask, but quickly put it back on after being observed by the captain.

The high temp was close to 100 degrees. Knowing this; I left a little early to make sure I could get to the aircraft early and ensure that it was cooled down before we began boarding. I got to the aircraft 62 minutes prior to our schedule push time. The aircraft was closed up; mobile bridge pulled and the vent flap on the main cabin door was opened. There was no external air hooked up. I proceeded to power up the aircraft and noted the cabin temp was reporting as 38 Celsius or 101 Fahrenheit. We had not yet been fueled; so I opted to start the APU to get air flowing and then made a call on the radio to Ops to get external air and AC connected in hopes it would happen before the fuel arrived and I would have to power down the APU. In the meantime; I personally walked through the cabin and opened each overhead gasper to maximize the airflow. Most of them were mostly or completely closed. About 5 minutes later; the fueler showed up; but there was still no external power or air connected. I told the fueler that I would prefer to wait until at least the external AC was hooked up since I had already 'set up' the aircraft FMS. As I was talking to the fueler; a ramp agent showed up; started the GPU and plugged in the cable. He then proceeded to walk to the gate next door. After getting back into the flight deck; I noticed that the external AC was not available. The same ramp agent was walking by the main cabin door at that point and I asked him to check the connection on the AC power as well as hook up the external air. He told me that he needed a lead to hook up the air; which was news to me. I called Ops again on the radio and requested a lead to hook up the air. About this time; the fueler had finished and I started up the APU again. Soon after; the gate agent came out to ask if we were ready to board. The FA (Flight Attendant) and I both agreed that the cabin was too warm to board right then; so we told them that we would wait and try to get the cabin a little cooler before we boarded. About 5 minutes prior to the normal boarding time (D-30); a ramp agent came up front and asked if we needed the external air hooked up. I told him that we had the APU running now and didn't need it anymore - note this was at least 30 minutes after I originally asked for air to be hooked up. Right at the regular boarding time (D-25); the cabin temp had shown a decreasing trend; down to 36 Celsius and the FA said she was comfortable boarding. We boarded up and pushed back on time. After arrival in ZZZ1 and walking to the van; the FA made a comment about how she 'shouldn't have done this' and that she had had trouble focusing and making her announcements because of the high cabin temperature. She made no mention of this to us until we were in ZZZ1. Flight Ops was asked multiple times to connect external air to help cool the cabin on an aircraft that was on the ground for nearly 10 hours in the sun and close to 100 degree temperatures. I was hoping that there would have been air hooked up at some point during that time period to help alleviate the heat issue in the cabin; of which the CRJ-200 is notorious for. While I felt that the cabin was noticeably cooler before we began to board; it was still fairly warm. I ultimately deferred to the FA as to whether or not she was comfortable boarding since she was the one that would be back there for the entirety of the flight. Maybe it was self-imposed pressure to try and get out on time or not cancel the flight that led her (and to a lesser extent; myself) to board before we should have. The FA did mention (multiple times) that she had picked up the trip so she could get to ZZZ2 the next morning from ZZZ.[I believe] there is no reason why an aircraft that is parked for 10 hours in high heat and direct sunlight is not hooked up to external air to cool the cabin. Even so; it shouldn't take 30 minutes to get someone out to the aircraft to hook it up after I call multiple times; especially after I advise them that we can't board until the cabin is cooled down. There really should be some kind of system in place for aircraft that are on the ground for an extended period to ensure that they are hooked up to external air at some point well prior to departure. On a day like this; I would think at least 90 minutes prior to departure would be prudent. In hindsight; I also could have coordinated with the regional controller and possibly swapped into a different aircraft.,,,,CRJ Captain reported issues getting cabin cooled before boarding. A Flight Attendant suggested they boarded too early.,"The incident involved a CRJ-200 aircraft experiencing difficulty in cooling its cabin before departure. The captain reported that the aircraft had been parked on the ground for over 10 hours in high temperatures, with the cabin temperature reaching 38°C (101°F). The captain made multiple requests to ground personnel to connect external cooling systems, but these were delayed. Despite starting the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and opening overhead gaspers to circulate air, the cabin remained warm. Approximately 30 minutes after the captain initially requested external air, a ramp agent connected the external cooling system. At the scheduled boarding time, the cabin temperature had decreased to 36°C (96.8°F), and the flight attendant felt comfortable boarding. The flight departed on time, but the flight attendant later expressed discomfort due to the high cabin temperature, which she believed impaired her ability to focus on her duties. The incident highlighted the challenges of cooling aircraft parked for extended periods in high temperatures and the need for improved communication and response protocols between flight crews and ground personnel to address such issues promptly. The captain suggested that a system should be in place to ensure external cooling is connected well in advance of departure, particularly for aircraft like the CRJ-200, which are more susceptible to heat-related comfort issues.","operational issues, between attendant and other people"

My other FA moved the passenger in row XX up so we could move the mother and child towards the back; hoping to make other guests happy; and to avoid complaints about the child not wearing a mask. During compliance; child is still not wearing a mask. FA offers a cookie trying to convince the child to wear a mask. Mother of child informs us she screams and cries when she wears it. Asked Customer Service lead to give a final warning to mother. Was a very uncomfortable situation as we witnessed the mother begin to pull out her phone. Mother was very upset. FA and I tried our best to assure the mother that we realize these times are hard and confusing and we empathize with her for her situation as it was tough for all of us. They both seemed to be happy towards end of flight as we provided snack and beverages to ease the situation.I do not think we should enforce young children to wear masks. Child could possibly have disability and be unable to wear the mask. We are unaware of the family's situation and it is very hard to enforce grown adults to wear masks; let alone young children who don't understand what is going on.,,Passenger came onboard with X-year old child not wearing a mask. Gate agent tells me they were told to put it on and the child was screaming. I go to the back with a cookie and kindly ask if she can put her mask on and the mom tries to put it on and the child refuses. I asked if she is willing to sit in row XX so she wouldn't be near any of the other passengers. I moved passengers that were within 3 rows away from the mom and child. The mom looked stressed and her eyes were red. I know our policy is black and white regarding our process and removing a passenger. I felt like moving the passenger was the best thing to do; as I did not want this to turn into another public nightmare. I also asked if anybody felt uncomfortable with the small child taking the mask off at times while she is sitting far from everybody else and they all agreed it was OK. I told Captain the situation and they called a duty officer on their behalf to clear us to leave. The reason for making the exception made sense. She was at least 3 rows away from the nearest person; we avoided a meltdown; she was getting her camera ready and the bathroom in the back was inop so we knew nobody would go back there. I believe no further action was needed. We got guidance on the full procedure from our pilots and everyone was extremely grateful for a resolution to make everyone happy onboard.We need a better mask policy for children; especially if they might have a disability.,,Flight attendants reported that a child was unable to wear a face mask due to crying; resulting in a stressful situation. The child and parent were reseated and the situation was resolved.,"The incident occurred when a mother and her X-year-old child boarded the aircraft without the child wearing a mask. Despite the gate agents informing the mother that the child needed to wear a mask, the child refused, and the mother was unable to comply due to the child's distress. The flight attendant attempted to resolve the situation by offering a cookie to the child and moving the mother and child to a different seat to minimize discomfort for other passengers. The mother, who appeared stressed and emotional, was empathized with by the flight attendant, who acknowledged the challenges of the situation. The flight attendant also questioned the enforceability of mask policies for young children, especially those who may have disabilities. The situation was ultimately resolved without further action, as the mother and child were reseated away from other passengers, and the flight attendant sought guidance from the captain and duty officer. The flight attendant proposed the need for a more flexible mask policy for children, particularly those with disabilities.","mask policy, health and medical issues, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and crew"

They would put a beverage on their tray and not be drinking but say they were actively drinking just; so they would not have to wear their mask.  The children rang their call button over and over wanting more items.  When the crew would approach we'd have to ask them to put their mask on.  We had repeated interactions with this whole family.  Again; most times their mask was off or not covering their nose.  PA's were made to remind guests of our mask policy.  They blatantly disregarded under the guise of drinking; or a few members would go by to gather trash they might put it on but take it off the moment we passed with trash.  This is a safety risk to others onboard and crew. They should not be allowed to fly with us if they cannot follow the CDC guidelines for everyone's safety.

After boarding was complete and the door was closed I did all my walk throughs and everything was good. While up in the air I did my service announcement which is telling passengers that I won't be doing a service and that a mask must be worn during the entire flight; I did the mask announcement twice before departure and while in the air...I just sat during the flight until it was time to do the final approach announcement. I walked back to collect any garbage and I noticed that he was sleeping and did not have his mask on. I kindly told him again that he needed to have his mask on. He put it on and I kept walking.

The incident began when a passenger was observed not wearing a face mask despite being reminded to do so. A fellow passenger (later identified as a Company X employee) notified the flight attendant of the non-compliance. The flight attendant provided a face mask to the passenger and requested that it be worn. The passenger complied initially but later removed the mask during the flight, despite the flight attendant's reminders.

During boarding and after takeoff; all required announcements including the announcement regarding the wearing of face masks were made.  As I took meal orders; I observed the Passenger X; [was] not wearing a face mask.  I advised her of the mask policy when I took her lunch preference.After takeoff; I once again observed that she was not wearing her mask.  The primary service was being served; so I decided I would monitor her for compliance once the meal service was complete.As I did a final pickup; I once again observed Passenger X not in compliance with the mask policy.  She was sitting in her seat; not consuming any food or beverages; and her mask was laying next to her seat. I made an additional PA regarding the mandatory mask policy hoping she would hear the PA and comply.  I waited approximately 10-15 minutes to see if she would wear her mask.   I approached her and said; 'Hello again; I'm the purser on today's flight.  I know I reminded you earlier about the mask; please understand that it is a requirement that it be worn unless you are actively eating food or drinking a beverage.'  She rolled her eyes and said; 'I am drinking;' as she held an empty blue plastic cup at her chin.  I explained to her that I had observed her not wearing the mask since prior to takeoff and that I needed her to comply for everyone's safety.  As I turned to walk away; she took the mask and threw it in the aisle. I looked at the manifest and discovered that Passenger X was a non-revenue passenger.I contacted the cockpit to advise the Captain of the situation.  The Captain advised me to inform Passenger X that she must comply with the mask wearing policy.  If she refused; he was going to have the aircraft met upon arrival in ZZZ1.  I retrieved one of the mask policy slips that explains the mask policy and once again approached Passenger X.  I asked her to confirm her last name as I wanted to be certain that it was truly her occupying seat XA.  She confirmed her identity as well as confirmed that she was traveling as a non-revenue passenger.  I gave her the form and explained in great detail that failure to comply with the mask policy would likely result in severe disciplinary action. I explained that the policy is mandatory and that the Captain wanted me to inform her that failure to comply would result in the aircraft being met upon arrival in ZZZ1.  She had requested more alcohol to drink so I informed her that the Captain and I had made the decision to not serve her anymore alcohol since she was being belligerent.  She put her hand up towards my face; shook her head and said 'really? This is so messed up. %$#%#!  (Yes; she used the %$#%# [language] towards me) The mask that she pushed into the aisle was still there so I had another mask with me as I didn't want her to wear a mask that had been in contact with the floor.  I asked her if she would like a clean mask. She accepted my offer of a mask.  I then informed her that I would pass along to the Captain how she responded.The FO exited the cockpit for a break shortly after my conversation with Passenger X.  FO also observed Passenger X sitting in seat XA without wearing her mask.  I once again contacted the cockpit and advised the Captain that Passenger X was still refusing to comply and that FO also witnessed her being non-compliant. Shortly after FO went on her break; I observed Passenger X put her mask on the right of her seat and pull the blanket up over her head.  She kept her head covered until we prepared the cabin for landing.  As we did final safety checks; I observed her remove the blanket from her head.

He got very loud and ornery with me. I went to inform the Captain about the situation and the passenger's behavior and the Captain turned me and said 'what do you want me to do about it.' I was shocked at his response. I figured he was not going to give any support to the situation so I just turned and walked out of the flight deck. Another crew member told me that Mr. A gave him attitude also. At this point I felt that the Captain was not going to give us any support to the situation so I briefed the rest of the flight attendants to not address Mr. A. about wearing his mask so that we would not have a bad situation happen inflight. I put the face mask policy on Mr. A's console and left the situation alone after that. Mr. A. did not wear his mask at all during the flight.,,,,Flight Attendant reported passenger refused to comply with the face mask policy.,"The incident began when a passenger, Mr. A, refused to comply with the face mask policy during the flight preparation. He disregarded the policy and continued using his phone, becoming loud and aggressive towards the flight attendant. The flight attendant sought the captain's support but received a questioning response, feeling unsupported. As a result, she instructed the crew to avoid confronting Mr. A to prevent further issues. Despite these efforts, Mr. A did not wear his mask during the flight.

I shared the requirements that went into effect. He said it does [meet the requirements]. Plus it looked like it was a weave similar to what we used to wear as kids to cover our mouths and neck in the Midwest winters. Not a tight weave at all. I looked up the policy. It didn't say much about weave; so I went and apologized to him; only to have my head bit off more.This walking; talking while holding a cup of coffee is not actively drinking. The only ACTIVE action is their germs being spread over the area and on us. Also showing passengers how to circumvent the procedure.DH Pilot only had mask on for takeoff; but did not cover his nose.

The pilots initially refused to wear masks, citing active drinking as their reason, though the flight attendant argued that their actions did not constitute active drinking. The NR Pilot also wore a wrap that did not meet the required standards, leading the flight attendant to check the policy, which lacked specific details on weave. Despite her apology, the NR Pilot remained non-compliant. The DH Pilot complied with the mask policy only during takeoff, failing to cover his nose, and slumped during a walkthrough, making it unclear if he adhered to the policy. The NR Pilot delayed compliance until the aircraft was taxing. Both pilots used their activities as excuses, with the NR Pilot becoming upset when addressed by another crew member. The flight attendant attempted to resolve the issues but lacked sufficient tools or authority, resulting in unresolved non-compliance by the pilots.

A gate agent in ZZZ informed the flight attendant about the passenger's non-compliance. The passenger intermittently wore a handkerchief as a mask but often let it fall, especially when the gate agent was not present. The flight attendant addressed the passenger before departure, explaining the policy and the risk of denied boarding. The passenger argued he was eating and only needed to wear the mask when not eating, continuing to keep it down during the flight. Despite repeated warnings, the passenger persisted, leading the flight attendant to inform him of potential denial of his connecting flight. The passenger protested, claiming interference with his rights, but the flight attendant stated the company's right to deny passage.

Although we make the announcements about masks often and model proper behavior; passengers often forget to pull the mask up to cover nose and mouth; letting it rest on chin.  What is especially problematic is that when I am serving; many pull it down and talk right at my face.  I step back and ask and motion to them to pull it up but often they seem confused.  This happens many many times on each flight.   Merely making announcements doesn't seem to do the trick.  Serving does not feel safe for me as a result.  It may seem like a silly idea; but what about a role play with the two flight attendants after takeoff in front of cabin to demonstrate not to pull down mask?  Sort of like the safety demo; with a set script where the one pretends to pull down mask and the other says 'Please don't do that!'It's worth a try.  It could stick in people's heads better with a demo; based on teaching techniques.,,,,Flight Attendant reported problems associated with passengers wearing face masks improperly.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and passengers regarding improper face mask usage during a flight. The flight attendant reported that passengers frequently failed to wear masks correctly, with some pulling them down to talk while she was serving. Despite repeated announcements and reminders, this issue persisted, creating a sense of unsafe working conditions for the flight attendant. As a proposed solution, the flight attendant suggested a role play demonstration after takeoff, where two flight attendants would simulate the proper use of masks, similar to the safety demo, to help passengers better understand the importance of mask adherence. The flight attendant expressed a desire for this approach to be considered to address the recurring issue.","mask policy, between attendant and passengers, safety related, crew-related issues"

I told him to put it on and he complied. During walk through; his seatbelt was once again off while the seatbelt sign was on. He had to be asked again to put it on. He wasn't happy about it but complied. After the cabin had been secured for landing and the cabin had been secured for anticipated turbulence; he took his mask back off.  At that point; it was turbulent and unsafe for us to get up. The other FA had to motion for him to put the mask back on.

It was unsafe to make him move back to seat for weight and balance.This passenger had a complete disregard for safety and was incredibly non compliant. While all little non compliant moments at first; it continued until he did something that was truly dangerous to the people sitting near him.

During the flight, the passenger also disregarded the seatbelt sign and did not properly secure his seatbelt on multiple occasions. Additionally, during turbulence on final approach, the passenger moved seats despite being instructed to remain seated, which posed a safety risk.

I went up to him and informed him that we need him to wear his mask and it needs to be over his nose and mouth as part of the policy. He then informed me that he had a medical issue preventing him from wearing the mask. I let him know that it has been a policy that every person flying must wear their mask over their nose and mouth and that I didn't want to report him which would suspend his travel privileges with us. He looked at me very annoyed and said 'well if I hold my water bottle; I cannot wear my mask; right?' I let him know that our policy is to wear your mask when not actively eating or drinking. So if he isn't drinking; he needs to be wearing his mask. I let him know that if he has a medical condition; then he may need to fly with a different carrier for the time being and that if he had a return flight; he would need to comply.

He stated that he was not seated during takeoff; his galley was not secure; and that coffee had spilled on himself and his iPad. He then went on to state that the reason he was not able to complete his tasks prior to pushback and departure was because he was having to deal with passengers and their improper usage of masks. The B; C; and D Flight Attendants did not mention any passenger issues to us.As the First Officer; take a more proactive role in ensuring the flight attendants acknowledge the single ring prior to takeoff.  Also; it is my understanding that the flight attendants are supposed to immediately inform the pilots of any disruption or disturbance in the cabin in which they are unable to perform or complete their required tasks.,,After giving the chime and monitoring the bell across the PA I called for the Before Takeoff Checklist.  After completing the checklist we switched the radio to Tower and they cleared us for takeoff with an aircraft on a 3 NM final.  With this distraction; I failed to listen to the A FA make his Departure PA.  Around 10;000 feet the A FA called to say he had been in the aisle during takeoff.  He told the FO he had been talking to a couple of passengers about wearing their masks and hadn't received the attendant chime.  He told the FO he had not fully secured the galley and had coffee spilled on his EFB and personal device.  He said he had no physical injury or harm and that overall he was fine.  I clearly heard the chime; but failed to monitor his PA.A FA should not be monitoring masks before takeoff at that time because non compliant passengers are less of a safety risk than delaying preparation for takeoff.  I will be more cognizant of listening to the FA PA per the AOM in the future.,,Air carrier flight crew reported a Flight Attendant was not seated for departure due to having to deal with passengers not properly wearing face masks.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (FA) and the flight crew of an air carrier. The FA reported being distracted during takeoff due to addressing passengers' improper mask usage, which prevented him from securing the galley and completing his pre-departure tasks. The FA spilled coffee on his electronic devices but was not physically injured. The flight crew acknowledged the issue and expressed that the FA should have focused on pre-takeoff preparations rather than mask compliance at that time. The flight crew also admitted to failing to monitor the cabin chime and the FA's public address announcement, contributing to the oversight. As a result, the flight crew resolved to be more diligent in adhering to protocols and monitoring cabin communications in the future.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew, passenger-related issues"

At this time seat XX2 had still been unoccupied. On my way forward; I secured the forward portion of the aircraft; where I had 2 passengers in seats Y1 and Y3 with all 3 tray tables down and all their carry-on items in the middle seat. I asked them to stow their items and continued forward. In the time that I made it forward; 3 more passengers boarded. First a gentleman; then 2 others that were traveling together. Without stepping in front of the first gentleman I acknowledged to him that there were still empty rows left in the back of the aircraft. I said the same thing to the two guys (traveling together). I saw the 2 guys make it to the back; but did notice the first gentleman sit down. During the demo; on my first walk-through; I had to stop at row X for the second time to address the carry-on and tray tables; although I would have most likely noticed the gentleman at this time; I did not. I knew we had been told we were on a 'short taxi' so there was a time constraint already. During my oxygen demo; I once again had to address row X; as they still had not moved their carry-on and now were not wearing their facial coverings. Again; I did not notice the gentleman.We quickly got up after 10;000 feet; I went to the back to get the snacks and this is when I realized he had not been sitting there when I briefed initially. I distributed snacks and then went to the gentleman who was sitting in seat XX3 and his wife who had moved to YY2 after he boarded. I gave him a briefing at that time.,,,,Flight Attendant reported not briefing an exit row passenger due to the late arrival of the passenger.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a flight attendant failed to properly brief an exit row passenger due to the passenger's late arrival. The flight attendant completed the initial passenger address (PA) and safety briefing after all passengers boarded. However, seat XX2 remained unoccupied during this time. The flight attendant secured the forward portion of the aircraft, dealing with two passengers in seats Y1 and Y3, who had their tray tables down and carry-on items in the aisle. She instructed them to stow their items and continued forward. As she moved forward, three additional passengers boarded, including a gentleman and two others traveling together. The flight attendant informed the gentleman and the two travelers about empty rows at the back of the aircraft. She observed the two travelers move to the back but noticed the gentleman sitting down. During the safety demonstration, the flight attendant was distracted by addressing unresolved issues in row X, including carry-on items and passengers not wearing facial coverings. She did not notice the gentleman during this time. After the aircraft reached 10,000 feet and the cabin crew began serving snacks, the flight attendant noticed that the gentleman had not been sitting in seat XX2, where he was initially briefed. She located him in seat XX3 and his wife in seat YY2, where they had moved after boarding. The flight attendant provided a safety briefing to the gentleman at that time. The flight attendant ultimately addressed the oversight by briefing the gentleman and his wife after noticing their reseating.

The flight attendant repeatedly requested compliance, adjusting the face mask and carry-on placement. Despite these efforts, Passenger X continued to disregard the instructions after the door was closed.

Instead of securing the door with the girt bar and attaching the red streamer as required, FA A omitted the latter step. Upon arrival at the gate, FA A disarmed the door and opened it prematurely before the jet bridge was in place, causing confusion and hesitation from the gate agent, who did not address the issue. Additionally, FA A repeatedly removed his face mask while speaking, raising concerns about mask compliance.

We called the customer service to notify her that a passenger appeared to be intoxicated. Customer service stated to me that the passenger did not appear to be intoxicated at that time. Under my observation; she did not appear that she was intoxicated. Enroute; I received a call from the Flight Attendant that the passenger was struggling to buckle her seatbelt and continued to take her mask off after multiple requests had been made. I made the non-compliance announcement for mask requirements; and she did not comply with the request either. We decided to have ZZZ1 customer service meet us at the gate to have the passenger removed. I notified Dispatch and ZZZ1 Operations to ensure we had someone meeting us at the aircraft. Upon arrival; customer service removed the passenger without any further issues. The event was caused by a passenger being intoxicated and a delayed reaction of the alcohol entering the blood stream; causing the effects of the alcohol to not become noticeable until enroute. Next time a passenger is appearing to be intoxicated; although multiple opinions on whether they appear to be intoxicated; have the passenger removed and tested for alcohol.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger appeared intoxicated during boarding; but was allowed to fly.

Despite initial observations suggesting the passenger was not intoxicated, the effects of alcohol became noticeable enroute, leading to non-compliance with safety protocols, including mask requirements. The flight attendant contacted customer service, who met the aircraft upon arrival and removed the passenger without further issues. The cause of the incident was attributed to the delayed effects of alcohol on the passenger. The proposed solution is to remove any passenger appearing intoxicated, regardless of initial assessments.","safety related, operational issues, health and medical issues, disruptive, between attendant and passengers"

I asked Passenger X once and he complied.  The next time I asked; he informed me 'I can't breathe.'I told him I was sorry but he agreed to our terms of face masks when he checked in.  He pulled mask up.  I did another trash run and mask was lowered again.  I reminded him of policy.  Instead of pulling it up; he requested to see the policy in writing.  He then spoke with other FA and said he was being singled out because of his tattoos.   She told him she had seen me as I had reminded several others.  She said further non-compliance could result in a ban on flying.I called Captain and asked to make the nose and mouth announcement.  Captain did.  I went back to show him the verbiage which explicitly spells out the policy.  I asked him if he would please comply.  He said 'I am complying; #%$^!'  His nostrils were clearly visible.  I left and called Captain; informing them of the non-compliance.  Captain confirmed and would notify the ground agents to meet the plane.Passenger Y talked to other FA and said I was harassing Passenger X.  He said others around him felt uncomfortable.  I said we needed people to comply with safety rules.  He said I hadn't said anything to a nearby woman when her mask was off; and I tried to explain it was because she was still eating and drinking.  But he was convinced I was discriminating in my enforcement.Make an announcement at boarding gate that explicitly tells people they can be banned for failure to comply with nose and mouth covered rule.,,,,Flight attendant reported a passenger was non-complaint with face mask policy during the flight.,"A flight attendant (Party1) observed Passenger X boarding with a mask that was not properly covering his nose. Passenger X initially complied with requests to adjust his mask but repeatedly disregarded the policy during the flight. Despite multiple reminders and being shown the policy in writing, Passenger X continued to lower his mask, claiming inability to breathe and accusing discrimination due to his tattoos. Another passenger, Passenger Y, supported Passenger X's claim, suggesting the flight attendant was targeting him unfairly. The flight attendant informed the captain, who made a cabin announcement about the mask policy. Repeated non-compliance led to a report to the captain, resulting in ground agents being alerted upon landing. Passenger Y's intervention indicated discomfort among other passengers. The flight attendant proposed an explicit announcement at the boarding gate to clarify mask policies and potential bans for non-compliance. Passenger X's non-compliance and allegations of discrimination were addressed through repeated reminders, policy review, and a cabin announcement. The situation remained unresolved, prompting ground intervention and a proposed boarding gate announcement to reinforce mask policies.","mask policy, safety related, between attendant and passengers, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, operational issues"

I then told Flight Attend B about my telling her and she did asked her to comply as well. She put the mask on after Flight Attendant B told her and she removed her mask after the wheels came up and it remained off while not eating or drinking during ascending phase. She then brought out a large bag of popcorn eating it one by one. When she was done with that she would take mini sips of her drink whenever we would walk by to give the appearance of constantly eating or drinking. Because 'briefly eating' leaves a window that is open for debate and we weren't sure what to do and felt because if she presented an attitude when boarding; it would cause a larger than life scene.

She put it on briefly but then took it off during taxi and takeoff. She put it on when we were able to get up again. As we were doing trash she had brought out a large bag of popcorn; which she ate one by one throughout the entire flight; keeping her mask off the entire time even though we made other announcements that masks were only to be removed briefly when actively eating or drinks she continued to take advantage of an unclear situation.

The passenger, referred to as Passenger X, was reminded multiple times to wear her face covering properly, but she initially refused to comply. Despite being addressed twice by the flight attendant and another crew member, Passenger X repeatedly removed her mask, particularly during the ascent and while eating or drinking. She also mocked the flight attendants with her husband by removing their masks and making faces toward other passengers. The flight attendants were uncertain how to address the situation further due to unclear policies on what constitutes ""briefly"" eating or drinking, which left an ambiguity that the passenger exploited.

The cleaner took off his mask to reprimand the D Flight Attendant after I pointed out their actions weren't safe. Furthermore; we have an hour and a half on the ground so such haste is not necessary. The practice of cleaners barging onboard and swimming upstream during deplaning is not safe and makes it even more impossible to socially distance.   Cleaners in ZZZ need to be reminded to give passengers space upon deplaning. The practice of coming onboard immediately after the L1 door opens needs to be stopped.

The flight attendant instructed the cleaners to wait until passengers had disembarked, but they refused, citing adherence to their protocol. During the exchange, a cleaner removed his mask, prompting further concern. The flight attendant emphasized that the cleaners' actions were unnecessary given the ample ground time (one and a half hours) available.

In response to the non-compliance, the primary Flight Attendant made public address (PA) announcements throughout the flight to remind passengers of the mask policy. The purpose of these announcements was to enforce consistency among crew members, ensuring that all were aligned in their approach to mask enforcement to avoid any perceptions of inconsistency or individual strictness. The non-compliance was resolved through the C Flight Attendant's intervention. The primary Flight Attendant emphasized the importance of consistent mask enforcement to maintain crew professionalism and avoid any negative perceptions.

During the boarding process from ZZZ-ZZZ1; I noticed that a passenger in the jetway was not wearing a face covering. When she entered the aircraft; at the forward entry; I politely asked the passenger if she had a face covering or a mask and if so; I kindly asked her to put it on. She shook her head and said 'Whatever.' I politely informed her of policy concerning wearing a face covering throughout her journey and offered her a complimentary mask. She appeared to be searching for her personal mask in her purse and refused a complimentary mask and walked away.After the boarding process was totally complete; the Ops Agent confirmed with me that all of the passengers were onboard.I proceeded to make the All Passengers Onboard PA. Afterward; I closed a few forward overhead bins a concerned passenger informed me that when she went to the aft lavatory; the passenger who came onboard without a face covering had taken it off. I thanked the concerned passenger and reminded her that the mask can be briefly removed for eating or taking medicine and also; thanked her for bringing it to my attention.Because; it was bought to my attention. I proceeded to address the passenger who boarded without a face covering and noticed once again that she was not complying and was not wearing a face covering. I politely approached her and kindly asked her to comply with airline policy and to put on her mask. Before; I could say anything else she immediately interrupted me and her tone of voice became aggressive toward me. In her aggressive tone of voice; she said: 'What! You got a problem with me.' I said no ma'am and quietly walked away. Because; she was not wearing a mask and her tone of voice elevated and she became aggressive. I did not want any potential traveling droplets to make contact with my eyes. Therefore; I quietly walked away. At this point; we were still at the gate and I knew I only had a short window to have the non-complaint passenger addressed concerning her not wearing a face covering.Therefore; I went to inform the Captain but he was in the lavatory. Also; I knew the Ops Agent had confirmed with me that boarding was complete. Then; I asked the C-Flight Attendant to stand at the forward entry; so; I could notify the Ops Agent for the appropriate Ground Operations or Supervisor to address the non-complaint passenger then I returned back to the aircraft.When the Ground Operations or Supervisor(s) arrived; I remained in the forward entry while they talked to the non-complaint passenger. I am not sure what she told them or what they said to her; but she and someone traveling with her were escorted off the aircraft. After; they deplaned. The Ops Agent said goodbye and closed the door.   With the world-wide spread of the coronavirus that could potentially spread through respiratory droplets; from person-to-person. In my mind; I was thinking this is a precaution COVID concern for the health and safety of the wellbeing of every passenger and crew member onboard and the best time to address policy is before we pushed back or have to return back to the gate because of a non-compliant passenger who was not wearing a face covering. The Captain was in the lavatory; the boarding process was totally complete and confirmed by the Ops Agent that the last person had boarded the aircraft. I had made the All Passengers Onboard PA. The concerned passenger was watching me after I spoke to the non-complaint passenger to see what I was going to do about the issue. I wanted to be proactive and take precaution; before closing the forward entry door; or possibly having to return back to the gate with a potentially bigger problem. The forward exits were monitored by Flight Attendant C. The aft exits were monitored by Flight Attendant B. When I returned back to the aircraft both Flight Attendants were visible to the passengers.In closing; for the safety; health; and wellbeing ofall of our passengers; the crew; and myself; I am committed to upholding airline policy and value every customer; their concerns; their health; their safety; their wellbeing; their business; and their flight experience when they board our aircraft.I believe it would be helpful if someone from ground operations could be visually within reach; for at least the last ten minutes before departure; to address or assist with any matter that may occur onboard or during the remaining minutes before departure time.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger was removed due to non-compliance with face mask policy.,"During the boarding process, a flight attendant noticed a passenger without a face mask.

The passenger, who had initially boarded the flight wearing a neck/face mask, removed it during the flight and switched to a white mask with a filter valve. This mask was connected to a powered air filter that the passenger wore around their neck. The flight attendant advised the passenger that they could not use the mask with a valve or the air filter, as these were not approved for use on the aircraft. The passenger disputed this, claiming they had been told by reservations that it was acceptable. The attendant attempted to resolve the issue by showing the passenger the airline's policy on face masks, which explicitly prohibited the use of masks with valves. The passenger took a photo of the policy but continued to use the unapproved mask. During the interaction, the passenger's companion complied by switching back to their original neck/face mask, but the passenger did not. As the flight neared its end, the passenger removed the unapproved mask and switched back to their original neck/face mask before deplaning. The flight attendant documented the incident as a report of passengers wearing non-approved face masks. No formal resolution was reached, and the passenger ultimately refused to comply with the attendant's instructions, resulting in a delay in the departure process.","safety related, mask policy, passenger-related issues, crew-related issues, communication issues, disruptive, between attendant and passengers"

On (date) we were advised spraying had been done on aircraft and that he had done it prior to our boarding as the stairs were down next turn in ZZZ the overhead bins were closed when we boarded; so they apparently were not sprayed as they were dry but they told the Supervisor it was and we were told to board. We had been at gate the whole time and aircraft had been secured with stairs up.Today the FO and I were on aircraft when sprayer showed up to spray we observed him spray at first bins on only one side then it was a spray here and spray there missing most bins. We got off aircraft as he got closer to us. I was in jetbridge for flight before due to mask issue and overheard the FO ask the sprayer about the spray process and the sprayer insisted he did every bin. The FO walked back on the aircraft with the sprayer and checked overhead bins where some were wet and most dry. The sprayer at that time resprayed correctly. We then notified via company that tables had not been cleaned by anyone; however they had left the clean checklist which was actually put in jetbridge and signed off on before anyone had done anything on aircraft. 3 people were sent back to clean trays tables. One female went through cabin putting trays down in aisles. A male showed up with what appeared to be a wet rag and another females showed up with a wipe as well. I was finishing up that I mentioned earlier and when the cleaners got off the other FA came up and told me she watched them wipe the aisle trays but never lowered the trays in window seats and clean them. I checked a few trays and there was food and dirt still on some trays.As I am discussing this with pilots and we send another message via company the gate agent comes down and tells us to write a report on it and board. Instead we requested cleaners to come back as the cabin was not up to airlines standards and did not reflect what we tell passengers in our announcements. A supervisor showed up asked what happened we told him and showed him a couple of the tray tables. He left came back and cleaned them himself. All of this caused us to be delayed 30 mins which would never would have happened if they had just cleaned the airplane properly the first time.,,,,Flight Attendant reported cleaners did not sanitize the aircraft per company standards/policy.,"The incident involved a conflict between the Flight Crew (specifically the Flight Attendant) and Maintenance regarding the improper sanitization and cleaning of an aircraft. The Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft's overhead bins were not sprayed properly during the scheduled cleaning process at the ZZZ station, as they were dry despite being claimed as sanitized. During the flight, the Flight Attendant and First Officer (FO) observed the cleaner failing to sanitize most overhead bins, with some being resprayed only after being questioned. Additionally, the Flight Attendant noted that the cabin's tray tables were not properly cleaned, with evidence of food and dirt remaining. Despite sending cleaners back to address the issue, some tasks were incomplete, leading to a 30-minute delay in departure. A supervisor eventually cleaned the affected tray tables himself. The root cause of the delay was identified as the initial inadequate cleaning process, which could have been avoided with proper sanitization. The proposed solution was to ensure the aircraft was cleaned correctly in the first instance, adhering to company standards.","between attendant and crew, crew-related issues, operational issues"

I was C; and could not see the seat from where I was standing in the exit row; and did not notice the passengers placing it during boarding.  I was busy greeting passengers as they walked through; and telling people who sat in the exit row that they were seated in the exit row; and verifying they were willing to sit there.  One woman was not responding to me; and I realized she could not hear me.  She said her ears were blocked from the last landing; and they had not cleared. Since she was unable to hear or respond to my questions; I told her I would have to re-seat her.  A gentleman in the exit row loudly said she was sick; and should not be allowed on the plane.  I asked her if she was sick; and she said no.  She appeared to be congested; which is likely the reason her ears blocked on landing.  I had her trade seats with another passenger; briefed the exit row and secured the forward cabin from the exit row forward.  When I got to the front; I informed A the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure.  I did not hear a PA that the aft cabin was secure. I informed the A that the woman I moved from the exit row could not hear; that she was congested but said she was not sick.  The A said she did not appear sick or have any COVID symptoms when she boarded. I said congestion could be a COVID symptom; and A seemed surprised; and said she never heard that.  By then operations was in front with us; and he and A said all I was required to do was ask if they are sick; and if the response is no; then we leave it alone.  I did not know if the passenger had allergies; a cold; or something more serious.The A was doing her final walk through prior to takeoff; and noticed a child seat directly behind the exit row. Someone notified the Captain; and A and D quickly had passengers change rows. The captain rang; I answered; and he asked if they were finished. I said I was C in front; and they were not quite done. He asked to be notified; and a few seconds later I let him know the exchange was complete.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger that sat in the exit row had hearing problems and was displaying symptoms of possibly being sick.,"During a pre-takeoff safety check, the flight attendant (Party1) noticed a child seat positioned directly behind the exit row. While conducting her duties, she was occupied with greeting passengers and ensuring that those seated in the exit row were willing to assume the responsibilities of that seat. A passenger in the exit row exhibited hearing difficulties, as she was unable to respond to the flight attendant's instructions. The passenger explained that her ears were blocked due to a prior landing, leading to congestion but not indicating that she was sick. The flight attendant attempted to reseat the passenger in accordance with safety protocols, but a gentleman seated nearby objected, claiming the passenger was sick and should not be on the plane. The passenger denied being sick, though her congestion raised concerns about potential COVID-19 symptoms. The flight attendant consulted with the captain and operations, who advised her that if the passenger was not explicitly sick or exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, she could remain on the plane. The flight attendant proceeded with reseating the passenger and securing the forward cabin. The incident was resolved after the flight attendant successfully completed the seat change and informed the captain that the exit row was briefed and the forward cabin was secure. The flight attendant did not hear a public address (PA) confirming the aft cabin was secure but ultimately ensured the situation was managed.","safety related, operational issues, communication issues, disruptive, health and medical issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people"

FA A said that still made her uncomfortable and I agree because she is going against compliance and stating that she is going to go around the rules. Also; apparently she is saying that she was never told to put on a mask but she was told two times once by both of us. The second time when I asked if she was not going to put it on she was already showing an increased attitude.A Supervisor [came] on board to escort her off the plane.

Upon the aircraft's arrival at the gate, the passenger continued to refuse to wear a mask and also stated her intention to eat and drink throughout the flight, which further disobeyed safety regulations. The passenger's behavior became increasingly confrontational, prompting the crew to involve a supervisor. The supervisor escorted the passenger off the aircraft. As a result of the passenger's refusal to comply, the entire aircraft was deplaned, leading to a delay in the flight.

She did not make these conditions known to me or the First Officer and continued working throughout the two day pairing. Following our trip I personally came down with chest congestion and a cough. The day after my trip I was notified by the Flight Attendant that she tested positive for COVID-19. I asked if the FA contacted the company and told her to feel better. I was off duty; but felt obligated to inform my First Officer and other Flight Attendant. According to the FA; she saw a doctor before the trip because she was feeling ill; but she was misdiagnosed with a sinus infection. Yet; she still flew with the supposed sinus infection; which turned out to be COVID-19.Lack of communication and transparency from the FA about her preexisting health condition led to the compromised safety of passengers and fellow flight crew. If unfit for duty; do not show up for work and compromise the health of aircrew/passengers/partners by disregarding the safety protocols and applicable FAR's that outline crew-member responsibilities.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported becoming ill after working on a trip with a sick Flight Attendant who did not inform all crew members that she was feeling sick and then later tested positive for COVID-19.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant who worked despite being unwell, having symptoms like back pain, weakness, headaches, and nausea, which were later diagnosed as COVID-19. The Flight Attendant failed to inform the Pilot in Command (PIC) and the First Officer about her condition, leading to her working while sick. As a result, the PIC became ill with chest congestion and a cough after the trip. The Flight Attendant had been misdiagnosed with a sinus infection before the trip. The PIC emphasized the need for crew members to communicate any health issues and not work if unfit, to prevent compromising safety protocols and crew health. The outcome highlighted the importance of adhering to safety guidelines to protect passengers and crew.","safety related, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew, health and medical issues, communication issues"

The flight attendant reported that the majority of passengers were not complying with the face mask policy, as 95% had their masks removed while the attendant was collecting trash and providing food and beverage service. Passengers were observed talking, eating, and requesting items without their masks on, despite numerous announcements reminding them to wear masks during service. The flight attendant highlighted that enforcing safety guidelines, such as maintaining a 6-foot distance and ensuring mask compliance, was challenging and often impossible during food and beverage service. The attendant expressed concerns about prioritizing passenger comfort and convenience over safety, emphasizing the need to protect front-line employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reported incident underscores the risks faced by flight attendants when balancing service duties with safety protocols. A proposed solution, as implied by the flight attendant, is to prioritize employee safety over food and beverage service, aligning with established safety guidelines.","mask policy, between attendant and passengers, safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, operational issues, health and medical issues"

I also reminded her that she agreed to our mask policy when she checked in. It had been under her chin and she moved it up over her mouth but left nose exposed. She then claimed our policy was over the top and I let her know that all major airlines had the same policy. Operations agent was informed of all of this but the woman was now wearing the mask properly; so she was allowed to stay. During the flight the woman was observed many times with the mask under her nose. The decision was made to have a Supervisor meet the flight in ZZZ.

The flight crew decided to involve a Supervisor upon arrival in ZZZ, but the Captain failed to initiate this.

Flight Attendant asked for a third time to cover her nose and mouth with either covering. She told him that she was fine; and to leave her alone. Flight Attendant X told me about the situation. I told the Captain. He; as most Captains agree: If someone doesn't listen to these rules; they probably won't observe other rules.The gate agent spoke to the passenger twice. Then a Customer Service Supervisor met the aircraft to escort her off the plane. The passenger then proceeded to try to speak to the Captain whilst passing through to the jet bridge. The Captain continued to support us; stating that she disrespected the crew. As she was trying to reason with our Captain; it was past departure time.

After multiple requests, the passenger remained non-compliant, prompting the attendant to inform the captain. The captain, adhering to safety protocols, supported the decision to address the issue. The gate agent intervened twice without success, leading a Customer Service Supervisor to escort the passenger off the aircraft. Despite her attempts to engage with the captain, the flight had already passed its departure time.

During boarding for the Passenger X was the last passenger to board. He came on with a mask in his hand. I was the A Flight Attendant (FA) and informed him of the mask requirement. I told him; 'The mask must be on for boarding and remain on the entire flight covering your nose and mouth.' He put his paper mask on and asked where his seat was since he couldn't remember. I looked up his seat number and it was XX4. After he sat down he took his mask off again according to the aft flight attendants. FA1 and FA2 both instructed him to put his mask on covering his nose and mouth. He complied when asked; but then removed it again during walk through before takeoff. FA1 came forward and told me about taking his mask off again. He said he lost his mask so she brought him a new one from our kit and he put it on. After takeoff during service he again had his mask off. The aft flight attendants again told him he must cover his nose and mouth.After discussing his non-compliance repeatedly with the COVID-19 mask policy we decided the next time he had it off we would issue a final warning. About an hour before landing in ZZZ a couple [of] passengers came forward to complain about a man not wearing his mask at all. I went back to talk to him and it was Passenger X in XX4 again. He was making those around him uncomfortable and they said he would take the mask off as soon at the flight attendants would walk away. I issued him a warning and explained to him that this was his final warning about not wearing his mask. He said he lost his mask again. I went and got him a new mask out of the flight attendant kit and explained again that it must cover his nose and mouth. I instructed him to read the policy and that if he violated the mask policy again he would be reported and banned from flying on our airline. He put on his new mask and acknowledged that he understood. During final descent as I was sitting in my jumpseat and Passenger X leaned in the aisle and removed his mask. During taxi to the gate he stood up and started walking. I got on the PA and said 'Please; remain in your seat with seatbelts fastened with masks covering nose and mouth.' He sat down but did not put his mask on. Passengers around him were shaking their heads.We didn't call to the gate for him to be met because we were almost there. When we reached the gate I informed the Customer Service Agent (CSA) about the situation. The CSA asked if we wanted the police; but we decided that since we were ready to deplane it wouldn't help. The Captain pointed Passenger X out as he was deplaning with no mask. He said that Passenger X was the same passenger that was an issue on his previous flight for not wearing a mask.  As Passenger X passed me during deplaning I explained that since he was not compliant to COVID-19 policies and our mask mandate he was getting reported as I warned he would during the flight. He just laughed and kept walking. He violated our COVID-19 mask policies repeatedly even with several warnings.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger refused to adhere to face mask policy.,"The incident involved a passenger, identified as Passenger X, who repeatedly failed to comply with the airline's COVID-19 face mask policy during a flight. The flight attendant (Party1) instructed Passenger X multiple times to wear his mask, as required by company and CDC guidelines. Despite initial compliance, Passenger X removed his mask several times during the flight, including after being provided with a new mask by the flight attendant. The flight attendant issued a final warning to Passenger X, explaining that further non-compliance would result in reporting and potential banning from the airline. Despite this, Passenger X continued to remove his mask, including during final descent and after being reminded to keep his mask on as the plane taxied to the gate. The flight attendant reported the situation to the Customer Service Agent upon arrival, and the passenger was warned that he would be reported for violating the mask policy. Passenger X was ultimately reported for his repeated non-compliance with the mask mandate.","mask policy, passenger-related issues, between attendant and passengers"

I went to first class to talk to the A FA and she was talking to the passenger in X6. She asked the man how old his child was; he said 2 years and X months old. FA A informed him the child is required to wear a mask. The man then said the child was under 2.  The issue now was the child under 2 was seated in [his own seat]. (The father had purchased a seat for the child); I recommended that we just move the father and child to the row behind them. The couple seated in Y 1 and 3 were the grandparents so the father and child switched seats with them.I returned to the aft of the aircraft. I was later informed by FA A that the agents told her the child was over 2 years old. Throughout the flight I was in the first class cabin and the child never had a mask on. ALSO!! When I was doing my demo the grandmother who was seated in X6 did not have her nose covered. I asked her very kindly to cover her nose and she rolled her eyes and gave a big huff but did cover her nose. I was called to guard the flight deck door and she once again did not have her nose covered. I explained that she needed to cover her nose; once again she objected but complied. Only the First Officer (FO) used the lavatory and in that short time I had to ask her at least 4 times to cover her nose. She was so rude and resistant. I finally told her that I wouldn't stand guard if she didn't keep her mask on. The FO came out of the lavatory; I explained to the FO what was going on; the woman saw me talking to the FO and put her mask over her nose. FA A finally gave the father a warning. Other than the mom and Grandpa this family was seldom; the 2 year old Child never did wear a mask; in compliance with our Mask policy.   The child was 2 years that is why the father purchased a seat. Both parents lied about the age of the child when they found out the child was required to wear a mask. Which then required us to move the child from X4.,,There's a family of four adults (parents and grandparents); a 2 year old and a baby. The 2 year old did not have his face mask on during boarding. I asked the father how old the child was. He said two and two months; I said that he had to have a mask on since he [was] over two.At that time the father said that his son was under two years old. The father grabbed his son and put him on his lap. His son was wiggling and fussing on his lap and finally he fell on the floor and screamed because of pain. He calmed down quickly; and still was sitting on dad's lap. (Later; during the flight the parents found a bleeding scratch on their son's back head and asked for First Aid antiseptic wipes.)The son looked like he was over 2 years old.  I asked the father what was the exact age of his son. He said that [he was] under Two. I had to call CSA and asked her to find out the exact age of the child. She found out that the child was over two years old. At that time I told the father that his son was not an infant; and he had to take his own seat and wear his face mask. The whole family were not happy with that; all the family members claimed the child was under two years old. Mother worried that they had purchased a seat for him and her son had to be on dad's lap. The father attempted to put a face mask on his son and he said that he would do his best to keep a face mask on during the flight. The family swapped seats.CSA came on board and asked if I wanted to remove the child from the flight. The father confirmed he would take all possible attempts to keep a face mask on his son. My decision was to keep the family on board.After 10;000 feet when I was taking the orders I saw that the boy did not have a mask on. I started talking to the father and he became not cooperative and talked to me in a rude manner. He said that his son was drinking water. I reminded him that the mask must be on when not actively eating or drinking. The father responded to me that I had to stay away from them; keep social distance (I did!); do not ask them any questions and do not offer them anything. At that time he actually was trying to make his son drink the water from the bottle in front of me. During the flight I was monitoring the child's compliance. He was watching his iPad and was not wearing a mask. I gave a warning to the father.During the rest of the flight the boy was not compliant. Parents put a bag of crackers in front of him to pretend he was actively eating.During the flight; with no mask on; they went to the lavatory in the aft (the forward lavatory was not operable). When they were coming back from the lavatory through the main cabin I was picking up trash and showed the father with my hands that mask must be on the child. The father ignored my request and just told me not to touch them. I talked to the Captain; explained the situation with the family who were not compliant and tried to hide the age of their child; and asked for a CSA to meet the flight in ZZZ. During demo and at cruising FA B had to ask grandmother to cover her nose many times. The grandmother was rolling her eyes when asked to cover her nose before we could let the pilots take a break. CSA met the flight in ZZZ and I reported the fact of hiding the child's age and the compliance issue to her.,,Flight Attendant crew reported a family did not comply with face mask policy.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (FA B) and a family traveling on a flight. The family included a 2-year-old child who was seated in his own seat but did not wear a face mask, despite the airline's policy requiring masks for children over 2 years old. The father initially claimed the child was under 2 years old, but it was later discovered that the child was over 2 years old. This led to a disagreement over the child's seating and mask compliance. FA B attempted to resolve the issue by suggesting a seat change, but the family was resistant. The father claimed the child was under 2 years old, even after being informed that the child was over 2. The family eventually swapped seats with the grandparents, but the child continued to refuse to wear a mask during the flight. The flight attendant repeatedly warned the father about the mask policy and reported the family's non-compliance to the cabin service assistant (CSA) and the captain. Additionally, the grandmother in the family repeatedly failed to comply with the mask policy, despite being reminded multiple times by the flight attendant. The family's non-compliance with the mask policy and their attempt to hide the child's age created a challenging situation for the flight attendant, who ultimately decided to allow the family to remain on the flight but reported the incident to the CSA upon landing. The incident highlights the challenges faced by flight attendants in enforcing mask policies and the need for passengers to adhere to safety regulations.","mask policy, between attendant and passengers, safety related, operational issues"

He came very close to me and my jumpseat; and I quickly asked if he wouldn't mind taking a step back; and thanks. I asked him also to please wear his face/nose covering. He replied that he did not have one. I began to feel very uncomfortable as he was having trouble keeping his distance while also not having a face covering on. I told him if you can go get your face covering at your seat; we'd all really appreciate it and I'll get your waters and snacks ready in the meantime. He said again he did not have one. I told him that we will provide one for you no problem. So I had Flight Attendant (FA) A go and grab one for him and he slowly and reluctantly put it on. He started saying that it doesn't make sense that he was allowed to board without one. I specifically recalled him wearing one before and during taxiing out.He stood in the back galley and was now complying with wearing the mask and I gave him some waters and snacks. He asked for my name and badge number to file a complaint. I told him that this isn't anything personal or something to argue about; it's just our company's policy to wear a face covering and it's something that not only makes me feel comfortable but all the people around you. I also gave him my first name and the flight number. He started to tell me in an argumentative way that it is how I said for him to put his face mask on that was rude especially with asking him to take a step back when he wasn't wearing one at all. I told him that I had nicely asked him and now you're wearing one that we provided; thanks. He explained further that he thinks that I'm 'one of those people on the left.' I simply explained to him that I don't want to argue about this as this is simply just a policy that everyone on board must comply with; that's it! He tried to keep arguing with me and I replied that I'm not here to argue about this; or what I was asking you to do; I'm just grateful that you're now wearing your mask; so thank you. He kept insisting that the crew today is terrible and that he wants to file a complaint. He also kept mentioning that he wasn't wearing one during boarding. Something felt a little off about him; I kept insisting that this is our policy and that we appreciate his compliance. No warning was necessary because the guest complied with wearing the mask from the point when I provided one.The guest claimed he was not wearing a face mask when boarding; even though I recall seeing him wear one. The guest maybe should have an extra reminder the next time he flies regarding the policy.

The attendant requested the passenger to step back and wear a mask, citing company policy. The passenger responded by stating he didn't have a mask and expressed discomfort. The attendant had another crew member fetch a mask, which the passenger reluctantly put on. The passenger then argued that the request was rude and claimed he wasn't wearing a mask during boarding, despite the attendant's recollection of him doing so. The passenger requested the attendant's details to file a complaint, accusing her of being partisan. The attendant repeatedly tried to de-escalate, emphasizing the policy's importance and appreciating the passenger's eventual compliance. Although the passenger persisted in his argument, the attendant noted no immediate action was needed, suggesting a reminder about the policy for future flights.","mask policy, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, operational issues"

It is also something that's included in our announcement before departure and our welcoming/safety announcement. When working AFT I actively check for mask; bag; and seat belt compliance prior to closure of the boarding door. I also ask the flight deck to make an announcement regarding face masks and to ensure coverage of both nose and mouth is included so that we are all unified. All gate agent pre-boarding announcements and Flight Attendant announcements should be updated to specify that passengers must cover their nose and mouths throughout the full duration of flight unless actively eating or drinking.Passenger X (X1) was the last passenger to board. The gate agent waited 10-15 minutes for this passenger. She mentioned that she reminded this passenger regarding mask compliance at the gate; however I was unaware until I saw her in passing between flights. I reminded this passenger to comply with his mask during boarding. Once the boarding door was closed the AFT FA asked the passenger to turn his phone on airplane mode and to disconnect his call. He complied until she walked passed and got directly back on the phone all through our safety demonstration. The non-revenue FA that sat in row X in front of the passenger rang the FA call button before I took my jumpseat to discreetly inform me that he was still on his cell phone. I glanced back and he was indeed holding a full conversation on his cell phone. I was unaware that the AFT FA had already asked him to end his call. He complied and I witnessed him turn his phone on airplane mode. I also asked this passenger to wear his mask properly and informed him that after I'd have to share our final warning. The non-revenue FA in row X rang me again to inform me that as soon as I took my jumpseat this passenger took another call and talked until his phone disconnected at 10;000 feet. During the duration of our flight this passenger manipulated the mask policy with food/beverages and was being completely rude towards me during the duration of our flight something the non-revenue FA witnessed also. Upon landing he positioned his mask to cover his mouth only intentionally. He became; loud; frustrated; combative; and used profanity when I kindly asked all passengers to take their seats during deplaning. He tried rushing to the aisle to exit the aircraft. He Immediately stormed off the aircraft. The non-revenue FA complimented me on how I handled everything.

To which he said that he just had surgery on his nose for cancer and that the mask hurts. I told him I was sorry for his nose and then said but it is our policy. He started to get a little [bit] of an attitude and said something about our policy. At that point I found a way to end the conversation because it was going nowhere. Then I went and explained it to the A Flight Attendant.We both believed giving him a warning would cause a bigger scene and we only have about 40 minutes flight time left. So far no one has complained about him; but if someone does we will have to issue the warning at that point.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger resisted adhering to face mask policy. No further action was taken for fear of escalating the situation.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant noticed a passenger, identified as Passenger in XX2, not wearing a face mask during the flight. The attendant approached the passenger, who was asleep, and attempted to enforce the face mask policy. The passenger responded by explaining that he had recently undergone surgery on his nose for cancer and that wearing a mask caused him pain. Despite the attendant's apologies and attempts to explain the policy, the passenger became increasingly argumentative. Recognizing that the situation was escalating and could potentially lead to further conflict, the attendant decided to discontinue the conversation. The attendant then informed another flight attendant, A, about the situation. Together, they concluded that issuing a warning to the passenger might escalate the situation further, especially since there were only 40 minutes of flight time remaining. No other passengers had raised complaints about the individual at that point. The flight attendant ultimately chose not to take further action, opting instead to monitor the situation and address it only if a complaint was received.","safety related, passenger-related issues, mask policy, communication issues, disruptive, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers"

After boarding was almost done; Flight Attendant (FA) D advised me that the child in row X is not wearing a mask.  I walked to their row and asked the parents if the child had a mask or would they like one of ours.  Both parents quickly stated; 'He's 2 and he won't wear a mask.  Good luck if you want to try.'  'We were told 2 is okay for no mask.'  'He won't wear a mask.'I decided to disengage and have the Customer Service Agent (CSA) contacted. I advised them that a CSA would be down to have a conversation with them. The Captain was advised and I asked for a CSA to come down to the aircraft. The boarding agent talked to the party and advised me that the parents were attempting to put a mask on the child.A second CSA came down and asked me about the age and our mask policy. She advised me they had a conversation with the party prior to boarding and wrongly advised the parents of the age requirement for wearing a mask. I advised the CSA it clearly states on policy that age 2 and up must wear a mask; no exceptions. The ZZZ Station needs to retrain or re-examine the Mask Policy because it is very clear on all guest facing touch points that our policy is stated age 2 and up. Our ZZZ Station CSA's are advising guests incorrect age requirements for our mask policy. I advised both CSA's that due to the statements made by the parents that their child would not wear a mask that the FA crew wanted them removed from the flight.As the family deplaned they yelled and blamed me for getting them kicked off this flight. I apologized but I reiterated our mask policy as they were deplaning.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a family with child were removed from the flight because of non-compliance regarding face mask policy. The family was incorrectly told by station agents; a mask was not required for the 2 year old.,"A conflict arose during a flight when a family with a 2-year-old child boarded without the child wearing a face mask. The flight attendant (FA) identified the issue and approached the parents, who refused to comply with the face mask policy, citing incorrect prior information from station agents that a 2-year-old does not need a mask. The FA escalated the matter by contacting a Customer Service Agent (CSA), who confirmed the parents' claim. However, the FA emphasized that the airline's policy clearly states that children aged 2 and older must wear masks, with no exceptions. The FA requested the family be removed from the flight due to their non-compliance. The family was eventually asked to deplane, blaming the FA for their removal. The FA apologized and reiterated the mask policy. The incident highlighted a potential need for retraining or re-examining the mask policy communication at the ZZZ Station, as the CSA had incorrectly advised the parents about the age requirement.","mask policy, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and passengers, training"

I briefed the OWWE (Over Wing Window Exit) and all were in compliance. My A FA; upon doing her final walk through for takeoff had to tell passenger seated XX2 to stow her bag back under the seat in front of her. Passenger in doing so FA A noticed she was wearing a small boot on her left foot. FA A informed the pilots we had to re-seat passenger. Pilots pulled over; passenger was reseated and we went on our way.I do not know the exact time of day this happened; but was told we arrived 5 minutes late. But it says differently on our payroll sheet which says we arrived early. With that being said; we had a few mask situations during descent; one passenger complaining another wasn't wearing her mask; both passenger were through passenger. Announcements were made; 2 of the 4 FAs spoke to the unmasked passenger. During cleaning of aircraft a passenger informed me of the passenger not wearing her mask. I spoke to the unmasked passenger explaining why she had to wear a mask; but we ended up requesting either Operations or a Supervisor to speak to unmasked passenger because she told me the old lady needs to mind her own business.

During the flight, the FA noticed a passenger wearing a small boot on her left foot, which required the passenger to be reseated. This led to a slight delay, though there was a discrepancy in the reported arrival time. During descent, two passengers were observed not wearing their masks, and the FA made announcements to address the issue. Two FAs spoke to the unmasked passengers, and an operations agent resolved the situation by speaking to the unmasked passenger, who then complied and moved seats.

There were passengers only covering their mouth and not their nose. There were many passengers who didn't have a mask on at all. When we would ask them to put a mask on they would roll their eyes; pretend to put it on and take it off as soon as we walked away. We all have families to go home to. This is not acceptable.

The flight attendant reported that passengers blatantly refused to comply with the mask-wearing requirement, which mandates masks to be worn at all times, even while sleeping, except when actively eating or drinking. Many passengers either did not wear masks at all, only covered their mouths, or removed their masks as soon as the flight attendant was out of sight. Despite the flight attendant's efforts to enforce the policy, the passengers displayed non-compliant behavior, including rolling their eyes and pretending to follow instructions. The flight attendant expressed concern over the lack of adherence, emphasizing the importance of mask-wearing for safety and the need for strict enforcement, as other airlines consistently enforce such policies. The proposed solution was to strictly enforce the mask policy for all passengers and crew, including mechanics, flight attendants, grounds operations personnel, and pilots.","safety related, between attendant and passengers, mask policy"

Flight Attendant B asked her to put the mask on and the passenger said she can't talk on the phone through a mask. Flight Attendant B insisted and the woman begrudgingly put the mask on. As I passed by the passenger she was again not wearing the mask and speaking on her phone. I stood by the seat in front of her waiting for a good break in the conversation for a time to talk with her and she wrapped up the conversation and said sorry and put the phone away. I told her it wasn't an issue with the phone; but the health and safety of those around her. She put her mask on. Shortly thereafter as we were preparing the cabin for departure I noticed her mask was below her nose. She was wearing her headphones and did not hear me; but when she saw me she pulled the mask up over her nose. Based on the attitude she gave Flight Attendant B and the fact that the mask was off again when I came by; and then not properly worn a third time Flight Attendant B and I concurred that if we had to speak with her again it would merit a disciplinary action. We also told the flight deck this; so that they would be aware. Throughout the flight we did have close eyes on her; as one does when a passenger has already exhibited behavior that is against the rules; but I tried not to hound on her. During service I saw her and some others wearing their mask below their nose or off in the long times between sips and I made a PA asking everyone to be compliant (in no way singling her out).Once it came time for final compliance for landing I came back through and again her mask was fully below her nose. I stopped and kneeled down and told her that we had already spoken with her about the mask and that wearing it under the nose does not comply. During the conversation that followed she did not pull her mask over her nose until after I had walked away.She told me that she has a medical condition that makes her light headed and that she has been doing her best with the mask. I told her that while for several months we had mask exemptions for medical cases for the last month it has been mandatory regardless of individual. She asked me for my full name and asked if she could take a picture of my name tag. I told her I was not comfortable giving my last name but if she reached out to the company they would know who I was. She said that I was rude for hounding her and briefly said the word 'Nazi' in reference to my strict adherence to the mask policy and 'targeting' of her.The specifics of timing between what was said during this conversation and what was said in the conversation after I brought disciplinary action and later during final compliance all kind of meld; but these things were said.She said that it was wrong to single out people who have medical conditions and that they don't have to share what the condition is. I reminded her that at no point did I ask her what her condition is and that she only shared that she had a condition at the end of the flight after things came to a head. I also explained again that regardless of condition the mask policy is for anyone who wants to fly.Some guests in the nearby rows thanked me for sticking to the policy as they had had concerns with the passenger in question not wearing her mask throughout the flight. I did my best to thank them for their support; but also to not rile up the non-compliant passenger nor the woman across the aisle who seemed to have befriended and come to the passenger's side (however this woman never spoke up to me or in my earshot). I did not want to put passengers against each other or cause more disruption.Passenger also said that she was not planning on flying [Airline] ever again. We let the Captain know [of the situation] and he called ahead to have a Supervisor meet passenger. During deplaning several of the other passengers that were in surrounding seats and had spoken up again thanked me for the way I handled the situation and said they'd be writing in to the company.,,Passenger was sitting in seat XX1. When securing the cabin before door closure she was on phone and had mask looped on one ear and hanging down and I asked her to put it on she said 'but I can't talk on the phone with it' and I said 'I apologize but it has to be worn over your nose and mouth at all times it is our policy' then she just looked at me with an attitude and then I asked her again if she could please put it on to which she said 'sssuurrreeee' and put it on. Then I informed another FA and told him to keep an eye on her and then he immediately walked through the cabin and she had it off again; not even one minute later. So he also asked her to put it on. After safety demo passenger had mask on but not covering her nose FA A asked her to pull it up and make sure it is covering both her nose and mouth.Inflight there were times she took exaggerated time to eat and drink. As were others in the cabin so we made a PA; (overall I bet we made 20 mask policy PAs during the entire flight).Then during descent FA A observed her with it off again. I seen him having a conversation with her so I approached and he mentioned to her the policy and the reasons and the procedure and then told her he would be back.He said she said she knows the policy. And around that time she mentioned to him that she was trying her best but she has a medical condition. She continued to argue with him and ask for his name to file a complaint. Passengers in front of and behind her gave thanks to FA A for enforcing the policy and said he handled it well. I do believe she overheard them praising him. We notified Captain and he informed [the] arrival station.,,Flight attendants reported a passenger did not comply with face mask policy during flight.,"The incident involved a passenger who repeatedly failed to comply with the face mask policy during a flight. Flight attendants initially approached the passenger, who argued about her inability to talk on the phone with the mask on. Despite reminders and policy explanations, the passenger continued to remove her mask, citing a medical condition. The attendants, following company protocols, persisted in their requests, leading to a confrontational exchange where the passenger used derogatory language. The situation was reported to the captain, who arranged for a supervisor to meet the passenger upon landing. The passenger expressed her intention not to fly with the airline again, while other passengers commended the attendants' adherence to safety regulations. The resolution involved ensuring the passenger was aware of the policy's enforceability and arranging post-flight follow-up with a supervisor.","mask policy, disruptive, operational issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and passengers"

I noticed him walk on with the gate agent who was asking him to put his mask back on. The gate agent then told me that they had been trying to get him on a flight for 3 days. I asked more about this; feeling a little concerned as to what could have caused them to deny him boarding these previous days and if it could be an issue during the flight. They told me the previous days he had not wanted to board the plane. He had explained to them that he hadn't gotten sleep and also hadn't eaten. I'm not sure what happened those past few days but it was communicated that he had gotten enough sleep and was able to finally board the plane.I made sure to ask clearly if they thought there might be any issue during the flight or if there was anything I should know that could cause an issue in-flight. The agent I talked to said she thought he was harmless.During boarding a woman nearby asked if he was going to wear his mask. I looked over and he had it down at his chin. I asked him to put it on and he did. This was an ongoing issue during the flight - he kept taking it off and we had to keep asking/reminding him to put it on.While taxiing to takeoff he got up out of his seat and moved a few rows back. I alerted the Captain but by this time he was already seated back down. We took off. I had him move back to sit in his original seat and he seemed fine the rest of the flight.   Right before takeoff while we were still taxiing; [he] got up out of his seat and moved back a few rows to the exit row. I called the Captain and let him know someone was out of his seat. By this time [he] was seated a few rows back. The pilot made an announcement that everyone needed to be in their seat and then we took off. We just continued with taking off when we were scheduled. The thing is; [he] was now seated in an exit row for takeoff and he had not been briefed to sit there. I also doubted his ability to perform the necessary exit row duties. Once we were up in the air I did go back and confirmed that [he] was now seated in an exit row. I had him move back to his original row where he stayed for the duration of the flight. The only other issues we had was that when I would walk by he wasn't always wearing his mask. I would remind him and he would put it on. He seemed not to be intentionally doing it but perhaps just not mentally 'all there.'More communication from CSA to CSA. When we arrived in ZZZ1 I alerted the gate agent that we had a meet and assist and the D FA pointed him out to the gate agent as he deplaned. I don't think the extent of the situation had been communicated. Then again it's not our job to babysit people. Maybe his family should have been contacted and asked to fly with him? He seemed unfit to fly on his own.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger kept switching seats and did not comply with face mask policy during flight.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and a passenger (Party2) on a flight. The passenger, who boarded late, had a history of being denied boarding for three days due to lack of sleep and hunger. On the flight day, he was permitted to board after claiming he was rested. The flight attendant noted his non-compliance with the face mask policy, requiring multiple reminders. Additionally, the passenger moved seats twice: first to the exit row during taxiing and again after takeoff, where he remained without proper briefing. The flight attendant had to intervene each time, successfully moving him back. The passenger also seemed mentally fatigued, often removing his mask unintentionally. Upon arrival, the flight attendant informed the gate agent but did not fully communicate the issues. She suggested that the passenger's family should have been contacted due to his apparent unfit state to fly alone. The flight continued without major disruption, but concerns about his fitness to fly alone were raised.","between attendant and passengers, mask policy, operational issues, health and medical issues"

I told her I would check and see if there was another seat she could move to.  At this time I did not see any open row that has no other people in it. I was going to send a flight family message to alert the Gate Agent. I walked up a row or two and another lady questioned me about why her seat would not recline (she was in front of the exit row). I explained to her why her seat would not recline and told her I would check with the agent about reseating them.  I then walked to the aft jump seat to send the flight family request. The agent then came down and we had a short conversation about rebooking the one lady and the other passengers who wanted a seat that reclined. There were no other seats to move the recline passenger to and the other passenger was given the option to take a later flight with no guarantee that she would have a seat by herself.  I informed all passengers involved. We took off and it was not till about mid flight that I realized that I had not ok'ed my exit seats. I proceeded right away to the exit row and briefed both passengers and they both were ok to sit in an exit row. The lady passenger did say that she noticed I had not briefed them before the flight. [The cause was] work overload.,,,,Flight Attendant reported inadvertently not briefing exit row passengers due to other passengers making special seating requests.,"During a flight, a flight attendant encountered two passenger requests that led to a challenging situation. First, a passenger sought a different seat due to discomfort sitting next to someone unknown. The flight attendant attempted to find an alternative but found none available. Second, another passenger's seat would not recline, as it was located in front of an exit row. The flight attendant explained this and suggested a later flight option, as no other seats were available. While managing these requests, the flight attendant neglected to brief the exit row passengers, a crucial safety procedure. Mid-flight, she realized this oversight and promptly briefed the exit row passengers, who agreed to their seats. The cause of the incident was attributed to work overload from handling multiple requests simultaneously. The flight attendant resolved the issue by briefing the exit row passengers mid-flight, ensuring safety standards were met. This incident underscores the importance of balancing multiple tasks and adhering to safety protocols, even under pressure.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and passengers"

[While] performing safety demonstration; [there were] passengers in [seats] XX1 and XX2 party of 2 traveling together male and a female.  The male passenger was talking on his phone; wearing his mask around his neck; when asked to put his mask he replied he was claustrophobic and could not wear his mask.  I informed him it was mandatory to wear the mask and if he was not able to comply with safety instructions that it would be addressed at that time not during the flight.  He cursed at me; at that time his female traveling companion told him to stop and to listen.  She said he would comply with crew member instructions.  I had to stop twice during the safety demonstration to tell him to put on mask and stop using his cell phone; he was [on] a phone call.FA D's jumpseat was directly in front of row YY and XX exit row. Upon FA taking his jumpseat for takeoff the passenger in seat XX1 was not wearing his mask; took off his shoes and had his duffle bag right at his feet.  FA D came to back to tell me what he was doing and that FA D was afraid to say anything to this passenger because he felt threatened by him and feared that this passenger would become violent with him.  At that point FA D called the Captain and told him everything that happen since this passenger came on board the flight.  FA D requested the Captain to remove this passenger from the fight.  However; the Captain came on the PA made an announcement to all the passengers that there was a passenger on board that was not complying with crew instructions and for the passenger to comply with airline instructions right away [or] that he would be going back to the gate.  Apparently the passenger immediately put his shoes and mask back on.  FA came back to this passenger and his duffle bag was placed in overhead compartment.  During takeoff he and his traveling companion pulled down their mask; this happened repeatedly throughout the flight.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger did not comply with the face mask policy; nor cell phone regulations.,"The incident occurred during a flight involving **FA B**, a flight attendant, and a male passenger seated in **XX1**. The passenger refused to comply with the mandatory face mask policy during the safety demonstration, citing claustrophobia. He was also using his cell phone, which was against regulations. When instructed to comply, the passenger cursed at FA B, prompting his traveling companion (a female passenger) to intervene and urge him to follow crew instructions. FA B had to pause the safety demonstration twice to address the passenger's non-compliance. Later, during takeoff, another flight attendant, **FA D**, noticed the passenger had removed his shoes, was not wearing a mask, and had placed his duffle bag near his feet. FA D felt threatened by the passenger's behavior and reported the situation to the captain. The captain addressed the issue over the public announcement system, requesting the passenger to comply with crew instructions immediately or face disembarkation. The passenger complied by putting on his shoes and mask and securing his bag in the overhead compartment. However, during takeoff and the subsequent flight, the passenger and his traveling companion repeatedly pulled down their masks, continuing to disregard the mask policy. The incident disrupted the flight and raised safety concerns for the crew.","mask policy, disruptive, safety related, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers"

The A FA was in the midst of making a PA; so I went back to talk to him. I politely asked this guest if he had a mask; if not I could provide him with one. He responded; that he indeed had one. I let him know that he had to put it on. I stood to the side while this guest put away his carry-on bags and got into seat and buckled up. At this point; I informed him that he needed to put his mask on at this time; and I walked up front to inform the A about our interaction. I went back closed some bins and saw that he still had no mask on. This time the A FA went back to this guest carrying some extra masks and asked him if he needed one. He responded to her saying he had one. So she politely asked him to put it on. In a stern and harsh voice; he told her 'I heard you the first time.' The A FA came forward. The Customer Service Agent (CSA) was by the boarding door; and the A informed her on what was going on and the CSA automatically knew who we were talking about. She already had a discussion with this guest about wearing a mask on the plane. He put it on in front of her; but took it off before he got on the plane. We decided that a Supervisor needed to have a talk with him. The A FA informed the Captain on the situation and he went to the back of the cabin; and noticed that this guest was still not wearing a mask.A CSA Supervisor; came onto the plane and removed the guest who was non-compliant with the company's face mask policy.,,Passenger in XX4 boarded the aircraft last; with no mask. I was making a PA while the FA D had just started closing bins etc. I noticed he was not wearing a mask after he passed me. D FA asked him to put a mask on and if he needed one. He said he had one. She asked him to put it on and thanked him. He stowed his bag and she again asked kindly to please make sure your mask is on. He did not. The FA walked away. After waiting approximately 5 minutes and no compliance I; the A FA walked backed back to his seat bringing extra masks. I tried to hand him one. He said I have one. And I said; please put it on. He then said sternly and harshly; I heard you the first time.  I walked way. He did not put a mask on. Our Captain walked by to introduce himself to the FAs in the back; the passenger still did not comply.  I asked the agent about him. She said; yes I had to tell him to put it on in order to board.  He complied; so I let him board. He obviously took it off after passing her. He was asked 4 times to comply. I decided giving him a warning before we closed the door was only going to escalate the situation.  We decided to ask the agent to deplane him. As he deplaned with agent he still did not have a mask on nor was he trying to put one on.

Passenger X started to go on about how a mask doesn't protect anyone; so at that point I said I would be back right back. Because he wanted to escalate the situation I went up to tell the A Flight Attendant; she came back and explained to Passenger X the company's policy.

I was in the front galley when he came forward because I had finished securing the cabin. The operations Agent and Supervisor left the aircraft; and the passenger was standing in the front galley. He was visibly frustrated on the event and started venting. This was in total public view of all other passengers on board. To help diffuse the situation; and spare the passenger from embarrassment; and to provide more of a private setting; I stepped off the aircraft with him; and stood at the bottom of the jetway with him while he vented to me. This was happening a few minutes before scheduled push time. I waited at the bottom of the jetway with the passenger for quite some time; expecting the operations Agent or Supervisor to come down; and I could direct him to them to answer questions he had. After several minutes; no one came to the plane; I made an executive decision to assist the passenger; told [Flight Attendant] A I was going to walk him to the top; and that I would be right back; since no agent was coming down. I walked him to the top of the jetway; where he was able to be properly assisted. I immediately walked back to the plane where a couple of minutes later we closed the door and pushed the flight as normal. Since the passenger was left at the plane; and there were no ground personnel to assist us (the Supervisor and operations Agent were there; then left); I made the executive decision to deplane.

I realize fully we all have a job to do; and cannot speak for why the Supervisor and operations agent left the passenger at the plane; and did not walk him up the jetway.

1768765,Aircraft X,Galley,Air Carrier,Flight Attendant (On Duty); Flight Attendant In Charge,Flight Attendant Current,,Safety Related Duties,Communication Breakdown,Party1 Flight Attendant; Party2 Flight Crew,1768765,,,,,,,,,,,,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Other / Unknown,,,Person Flight Attendant,Aircraft In Service At Gate,General None Reported / Taken,Human Factors; Company Policy; Environment - Non Weather Related,Human Factors,I arrived at Flight ABC early and started sanitizing the phone and high touch-point areas in the forward galley. I also stocked the cockpit with a 6 pack of water and continued to do my security checks. C Flight Attendant arrived a little later and we chatted catching up since we last worked together. Shortly thereafter; B Flight Attendant arrived. B Flight Attendant and I started chatting and catching up since we had not worked together since 2019. Toward the end of B Flight Attendant and my conversation with C Flight Attendant present; I stated; 'These are crazy times since COVID. C Flight Attendant and I have recently worked together. So that we can better protect each other and social distance as much as possible; B Flight Attendant and I can do the water service. You (B Flight Attendant) can serve from the back and I can serve from the front and that we can meet somewhere in the middle of the cabin. C Flight Attendant can pass out the snacks. We all can take turns making trash runs individually. You and I can also pass out the paperwork the same way. You can distribute paperwork starting from the back of the cabin and I will start from the front of the cabin and we will meet somewhere in the middle of the cabin.' We all agreed.C Flight Attendant and B Flight Attendant continued to chat and I continued setting up and arranging my workspace in the forward galley.  As I was kneeling checking my compartment in the forward bulkhead; the First Officer walked onto the aircraft.  As he was making his greeting of 'Hello; I'm FO [name];' I responded 'Hello; I'm (A Flight Attendant)' as I raised up to greet him. As I stood up; [the] FO and I were face to face and I was startled that he was not wearing a mask. I immediately asked while stepping back creating social distance; 'Where's your mask?' FO responded; 'Where's my mask?' I repeated; 'Yes; where is your mask. We all need to wear our mask to help prevent the spread of the Coronavirus and to keep each other and their families safe.' [The] FO reached into his pocket and pulled his face mask out of it. He then rolled his bags into the cockpit with his mask in his hand. I then pushed up the cockpit door as I completed my rev napkin and completed the security document.Shortly after [the] FO got settled in the cockpit; he came out back into the cabin; but wearing his mask this time. He then said; 'Do you feel safer now that I am wearing the mask?' I responded; 'Absolutely. Thank You.' He then walked further into the cabin where C Flight Attendant and B Flight Attendant were standing between the bulkhead and row X talking. [The] FO was standing with his back against the bulkhead on the Captain side of the cabin/leaning into the aisle and B Flight Attendant was in the center of the aisle between row 1 and 2; C Flight Attendant was standing in front of row X in front of the bulkhead leaning toward the aisle. The Operations agent came and informed me of the specials and that boarding would be starting [soon]. I then went to retrieve gloves from the bulkhead compartment when I noticed that B Flight Attendant was no longer wearing her mask. She had her mask in her right hand. FO did not have his mask on properly. FO's mask was dangling by one strap on his right ear hanging down the right side of his face. Both of their noses and mouths were completely exposed as they were engaging in conversations. I then stated; 'Guys; we are about to start boarding and we are crew and it is very important that we all wear our masks over our nose and mouths while we are on the aircraft for our safety as well as the passengers who will be here shortly.' B Flight Attendant just stared at me. No one attempted to put their masks on immediately. I then repeated; 'Can I have both of you put your masks on to help the efforts of reducing the spread of COVID?' B Flight Attendant rolled her eyes at me and put her mask on covering her nose and mouth and started to walk down the aisle. FO then put on his maskand started walking back the main entrance area where I was standing.I then initiated the high-low chime to initiate that boarding would be starting shortly. FO says; as he is looking in the mirror adjusting his mask; 'Does this thing make you feel safer?' I said; 'Definitely. The masks when worn properly and with social distancing and good hand hygiene slows the spread of COVID.' FO says sarcastically; 'What is COVID?' I responded;' Everyone in the U.S. knows what COVID is since we have been dealing with it since March/April.' FO says; 'Well; I have never heard of it.' I said; 'It is a worldwide Pandemic therefore; you and everyone else has heard of it and knows exactly what it is for certain. The CDC; NIH; WHO; and the company have set guidelines stating that we all must wear mask on the planes. This should be second nature for all of us since most states have a mask mandate for public places since March/April.' We started boarding. The Captain came on the aircraft. He introduced himself and asked how things were going. I said; 'Hi! I'm (A Flight Attendant). Everything is okay except; the FO came on the aircraft without a mask and he was condescending; sarcastic; responding to me. He said; 'I wasn't here for that. I'm sorry that happened.  With the exception to the mask situation is everything okay. I said; 'Yes.' He gave me the pre-flight briefing to pass to the other Flight Attendants. He went into the cockpit. Boarding continued.In between the lag in the boarding process; B Flight Attendant comes up front from her boarding position in the back. She then opens the cockpit door (that I have pushed up as a protection since the pilots are not masked on the flight deck) and enters the cockpit and closed the door behind her. I continued to stay in my boarding position and continued the boarding process.  After about 5-7 minutes B Flight Attendant came out of the cockpit and went back to her boarding position. We continued the boarding process. I had completed the Opening PA and secured the cabin. (C Flight Attendant) came up front to tell me that the overwing was briefed. Captain then comes out of the cockpit and asked C-FA and I if everything was okay. C-FA and I responded; 'Yes.'Captain then went the back galley and talked to (B Flight Attendant) for a few minutes. During this time; I started to feel that the conversations that (B Flight Attendant) had when she entered the cockpit and their current conversation; I am the subject of discussion. So; when the Captain came back to the front of the plane I motioned for him to join me in the jetbridge to give him my version of events of (B Flight Attendant) and FO being annoyed with me for asking them to wear their masks on the plane. Since the passengers were on the plane; Captain and I stepped into the jetbridge. I told the Captain that I had asked (B Flight Attendant) and FO to put on their mask in effort to prevent or slow the spread of COVID. I told him that B Flight Attendant rolled her eyes at me and FO responded very sarcastically and condescendingly antagonizing me with a lengthy conversation regarding the mask. I did not ask anything of them outside of established protocols and guidelines established by the company; the State; and the CDC. The masks are a necessary piece of PPE that is necessary to prevent or slow the spread of COVID.'The Captain then said; 'I just need to know if you are going to be comfortable working with your crew on the plane.' I was startled and confused. I said. 'I'm sorry; I am not understanding your line of questioning.' He said; 'I don't know if you are comfortable working in a small space that is not going to give you 6 feet of space between you and your crew.' I said; 'I am talking to you about the mask policy and you are talking about social distancing. Then it dawned on me that B Flight Attendant must have said something to him about our social distancing conversation. He then repeated; 'I don't know if you are comfortable working in a small space that is not going to give you 6 feet of space between you and your crew.' I then said; 'WHOA; don't put words in my mouth. I never said anything about 6 feet of distancing to you or anyone else. There is ABSOLUTELY no way you can do our jobs with 6 feet of separation that is absurd and totally unrealistic. The passengers with the middle empty seat doesn't even have 6 feet between them. The C Flight Attendant sitting on row X is not 6 feet from the X jumpseat. When you briefed me earlier you were far less than 6 feet from me and I had no issues with distance. At this very moment that we are talking you are far less than 6 feet from me and I am fine; therefore; I think you know the answer to your question. If you need me to verbally say it; then I am fine being less than 6 feet from my crew and passengers.' He then said; 'With everything that you have on it is hard to believe that.' I said; 'I am wearing my mask and gloves which the company has approved as acceptable PPE for COVID when working; therefore I do not understand why it's concerning to you as an indication that I am uncomfortable being less than 6 feet from the passengers and my crew. We all should be using reasonable social distancing; PPE; and best hygiene practices collectively to prevent or slow the spread of COVID. I am just asking that protocol is being followed regarding my crew and passengers wearing face masks.'He then asked; 'Well is it protocol to close the cockpit door during boarding? I said; 'I never closed the door. The door was ajar with the latch/lock extended to prevent closing because you all (Captain and FO) did not have on mask on the flight deck and I had to remain in my boarding position that would put me in grave risk of potential COVID exposure or contracting COVID. My masks and PPE that I am wearing protects you and your family. If you and FO are in the cockpit without mask; there is nothing to protect me and my family since I must stand there for 30 minutes or longer. I used the ajar door as a protective shield for me from a potential COVID infection.' He said; 'You did not ask me.' I said; 'Sir; we obviously are having miscommunication; because you did not tell me that it bothered you.' He said; 'We do not have to wear masks when we are in the cockpit and when you close the door I can't hear the FO do the checks.' I said; 'That's a first. Most of the pilots close to door to hear better in the cockpit; but if you don't want the door ajar; then I won't do that. Will you at least wear the mask when the cockpit door is open to help protect me and my family from potentially contracting COVID since a lot of us may be asymptomatic spreaders?' He said; 'So you are asking us to wear a mask in the flight deck even though that is not our protocol?' I said; 'Sir; I am wearing my PPE and the passengers are wearing their PPE to protect others including you; therefore; I am asking you to wear PPE anytime you are on the plane where COVID could be potentially spread to me and others.' He said; 'Let me get this right. You want us to wear mask in the cockpit even though that is not our protocol.' I said; 'Sir; I am asking you to reciprocate the protections that I am affording you and your family by wearing my PPE properly. I am just asking for you to wear the mask to protect me and my family. How is it that we require passengers to do what we as crew are not willing to do? I have to stand in my boarding position which would be gross negligence since I would be in the path of a potential COVID exposure with no protections if you and the FO do not wear the mask with the door open. No problem. I am not willing to expose myself and my family to that level of risk. That level of consequence should not be required or expected of me while doing my job. I will have to just stand on the outside of the aircraft in front of the entrance and greet the passengers who will be wearing masks during boarding and deplaning.'He then asked; 'If,,,,Flight Attendant reported having a disagreement with the Captain and First Officer regarding their compliance with wearing face masks.,"The incident occurred when Flight Attendant A encountered non-compliance with mask policies and sarcastic remarks from the First Officer (FO) regarding COVID protocols. A addressed the FO's lack of a mask and emphasized the importance of masks as PPE. During boarding, A noticed both the FO and another flight attendant, B, were not wearing their masks properly and requested they comply. The FO made sarcastic comments about COVID, leading to a confrontation. A later discussed her concerns with the Captain, who expressed worries about her comfort working with the crew. A explained that social distancing was impractical and stressed the need for masks to protect everyone. The Captain questioned the necessity of masks in the cockpit, prompting A to suggest that the crew should wear masks when the door was open for mutual protection. The situation highlighted the need for consistent compliance with safety protocols and respectful communication among crew members.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, mask policy, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

He said he did have a mask; but just needed to find it. He made his way to his seat in X6 and was putting his seatbelt on. I told him since he was in the bulkhead he'd have to stow his bags above him in the overhead bin. He is now moving around; bending down close to the gentleman beside him; who clearly looked uncomfortable. I then handed him a mask and told him he needed to put it on. He said once again; he has one. My B-FA then comes up and I inform him of the situation. B FA says to the gentleman he needs to put his mask on and the man loudly and rudely says; 'Oh would you just shut your mouth!!'

Initially, the passenger claimed to have a mask but was slow to comply, causing the flight attendant to provide one. The passenger became belligerent when instructed again to wear the mask, responding rudely to the flight attendant. The lead flight attendant and captain intervened, instructing the passenger to be removed. Security was contacted, and the passenger was escorted off the aircraft. The outcome ensured compliance with safety protocols and maintained order on the flight.","mask policy, disruptive, between attendant and passengers, safety related"

A passenger was assigned a seat that had been blocked for social distancing and safety purposes, which posed a potential risk to the FA's safety. The FA requested the CSA to reassign the passenger to another seat in accordance with social distancing guidelines. However, the CSA refused to comply with the request, violating established policies and creating a safety concern. As a proposed solution, the FA suggested reseating a solo traveler from another row, but this was not implemented by the CSA.

I made all the required announcements; so I believe 4 PAs were made referring to masks. The pilots also made an additional mask announcement. Once we got in the air the passenger took his mask off completely. We serve so much food on a two hour flight that he constantly had food in front of him. Every time I asked him to put his mask on he would take a bite of food. Every time I looked at him; he would take a bite. I could not really give him a warning because every time I looked at him; he would take a bite of something. But he did not wear his mask the entire flight until we were cleaning up at 10;000 feet. Do we really need to serve so much food. On a two-hour flight we provide several food services. Tough to enforce the mask policy when people are constantly eating. This passenger knew better; but just refused to wear his mask. Reevaluate the amount of food served on a two hour flight.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that by providing passengers several food services allowed passengers to eat constantly and not have to comply with the face mask policy.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and a passenger over mask compliance during a two-hour flight. The flight attendant repeatedly requested the passenger to wear their mask properly, making four passenger announcements and having the pilots make an additional announcement. Despite these efforts, the passenger removed their mask entirely once airborne. The flight attendant observed that the extensive food service provided during the flight made it difficult to enforce the mask policy, as the passenger frequently ate and removed their mask. The attendant was unable to issue warnings due to the passenger's consistent eating behavior. The passenger did not comply until the flight was cleaning up at 10,000 feet. The flight attendant suggested reevaluating the amount of food served to facilitate better adherence to mask policies.","mask policy, passenger-related issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and passengers, disruptive, operational issues"

This communication breakdown led to a delay in providing an aisle chair for a connecting passenger, causing three passengers to remain on the aircraft longer than expected. The flight attendant expressed regret for the delay and suggested that ensuring access to jet bridge phone numbers could prevent future issues. To address the communication challenges, it was recommended that every flight be equipped with jet bridge phone numbers to facilitate timely communication with ground agents, thereby improving customer service and ensuring timely passenger deplaning.","between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, equipment malfunction, operational issues, communication issues, passenger-related issues"

The passenger had a hoverboard in a box that was initially unnoticed during boarding but was observed during taxi-out. The FA reported this to the Captain, who permitted it if the lithium battery was under 50 grams, citing their manual. However, the FA referenced their manual, which prohibited PMDs (Personal Mobility Devices) as carry-on or checked baggage. The manual was found to have conflicting sections: one prohibiting PMDs and another allowing them with battery limitations, which were unclear regarding exact gram limits. The flight crew believed their manual permitted the hoverboard's battery. To resolve the issue, they proposed aligning FA and flight crew manuals to avoid confusion, adding boarding pass notifications for bulkhead passengers to brief at the gate, and enhancing the FA manual's specificity on PMD definitions under hazardous materials. The key cause was manual discrepancies, with proposed solutions to improve clarity and procedures.","between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, operational issues, safety related, lithium batteries"

He would do it and then later remove it. He was told at least 5 times before the crew let me know that they had each told the passenger to comply.  As the only FA who had not approached the passenger I went up to ask him to comply with our mask policy.  After I left the passenger; the crew let me know that he took it off again and that other passengers around him were asking to make sure he was wearing his mask.  I then went to grab one of our on board masks and policy document to give to him.  When giving him one of our masks he grabbed it; put it on and then closed his eyes and proceeded to go to sleep. I tried to give him an explanation of the policy document but he proceeded to ignore me.  After beginning service FA D and FA C saw him again not complying.  As a result; the flight deck was notified by FA A of the non-compliant passenger.  FA A also went to speak to the passenger one more time to make sure he was aware of our mask policy and what was being provided by the policy document.Make sure the passenger is spoken to about our mask policy.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger was not compliant with face mask policy during flight.,"The incident began when a passenger repeatedly failed to adhere to the face mask policy, despite being reminded at least five times by flight attendants. Flight Attendant B, after others had attempted unsuccessfully, approached the passenger and requested compliance. The passenger initially complied but later removed the mask again, prompting nearby passengers to inquire. Attendant B retrieved an additional mask and policy document, which the passenger took but ignored the explanation. Subsequent observations by other attendants revealed ongoing non-compliance. Flight Attendant A was notified and engaged the passenger again, ensuring he was aware of the policy.

There was a lot going on in the exit row and I was preoccupied with confirming that two younger passengers met the age requirement and whether another passenger was willing to assist. One of the last passengers to board was holding a really small dog in front of her face and I was concerned with whether or not she was wearing a mask with a valve on it. After she sat in the exit row and I determined she had a mask with a valve and needed to get her a disposable mask; I failed to realize that her dog disqualified her from sitting there because I was distracted by her mask and addressing the other passengers' needs to meet exit seat criteria. I did confirm the other passengers' eligibility and briefed the exit row passengers; but during cruise; the B Flight Attendant notified me there was a passenger with a dog in the exit row. I was shocked to realize my mistake and immediately moved the passenger to an empty seat behind the exit row; so the passengers met the exit seat criteria for final descent.Focus my attention on scanning each passenger again for selection criteria prior to briefing and really check on their laps and under their seats for pets. Have the B or D Flight Attendant cross check exit row passenger selection criteria after boarding is complete. Ensure the operations agent gives out disposable masks to passengers with valves prior to boarding; so flight attendants can focus more on other safety precautions. Have operations agent notify any passengers with pets that they cannot occupy an exit seat as they scan their boarding pass.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger with a dog was seated in the exit row; however; the flight attendant did not recognize this due to being distracted with the passenger's face mask non-compliance.,"The incident occurred during boarding when a flight attendant was evaluating passengers for exit row seating eligibility. The attendant was distracted by a passenger's mask with a valve, failing to notice that the passenger was holding a small dog, which disqualified her from sitting in the exit row. Despite confirming other passengers' eligibility, the issue remained unnoticed until another attendant notified her during the cruise. The attendant promptly moved the passenger to an appropriate seat. To prevent such occurrences, she proposed enhancing scanning procedures for pets, cross-checking by another attendant, pre-boarding mask distribution, and informing pet owners about exit row restrictions.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, training, between attendant and passengers"

Captain continued to look for another FA to go in the cockpit.My take: If there is no courtesy to me or any of my flight attendants; why should we have to go in the cockpit? When I said I had a problem; he should have backed off. Yet; now he was telling us; he had no problem wearing a mask; but the FO had. Then; later; [the] FO comes out of cockpit not wearing a mask; and proceeds to talk (very close) to a FA standing near him; with no mask on. I reminded him; to go out; he had to wear a mask. He put his mask on.I have a problem with a pilot who does not care about our well being. Our health; our ability to work and stay healthy to support our families; and all that comes with us exposing ourselves. It is not acceptable and it should not be tolerated to continue to ask for a FA to go inside the cockpit when the FO was not going to wear a mask.Today; we had an XX:59 minutes duty day + hour before and hour after wearing a mask.  The least he could do is wearing a mask for 5 minutes when one of us goes inside to relieve them. It's intimidating; it's a disregard of others and disrespectful to all FA group; as if we do not matter.This is not company policy and someone should speak with him about caring for his coworkers; or anyone for that matter. Because I bet he is not wearing a mask where he goes. Just unacceptable.

The Flight Attendant reported that the Captain asked for other flight attendants who would be willing to provide break relief under those conditions.,"The incident occurred when the First Officer (FO) refused to wear a face mask in the cockpit, prompting a Flight Attendant (FA) to object. The Captain attempted to find another FA to provide break relief under these conditions but faced refusal. The FA felt the FO's behavior was unsafe and disrespectful, given the long duty hours and the importance of health and safety. The FA emphasized that wearing a mask for a few minutes was a minimal request. The result was the FA's refusal to comply, and a proposed solution was to address the issue with the FO about showing consideration for coworkers.","safety related, crew-related issues, mask policy, between attendant and crew"

He said do you want me to move? I said no you're fine I just wanna make sure that you're aware that you're in the exit row. And that was it.I don't know if you could not hear me because of the mask.

The flight attendant, wearing a face mask, asked the passenger in the exit row if they were willing and able to assume the role. The passenger responded by asking for water, which the flight attendant initially misunderstood as a request to move. After clarifying, the passenger agreed to remain in the seat. The flight attendant reflected on the possibility that the passenger may have misheard due to the face mask, speaking too fast, or unclear articulation.

I was in the back; waiting for the aisle to clear so I could close the overhead bins and brief exit rows. I noticed the customer was in the galley speaking with the forward FA. I wasn't sure what her seat was; so I waited for her to go to her seat before I started walking forward and closing the bins. She grabbed her bag from row X and then sat in XYA; the exit row. I just assumed that was her assigned seat at the time. I closed the bins all the way to the front. I noticed a pilot commuting in row Z who had his mask around his chin and wasn't eating. I requested he put his mask back up and he did. The man behind him in X4 had his mask completely off; so I asked him to put it on and he did. When I asked that guy to put his on; another customer across also pulled theirs up; so I didn't have to ask that third person. I don't recall where the third person was sitting; I only remember they sat in [the area] on the left side of the aircraft. They put their mask up before I asked; so I didn't think much of that.I was quite annoyed that I had to remind so many customers to put their masks up. I briefed the exits like normal. After the door was closed and I did my compliance checks; other flight attendant motioned me toward her before the safety demo. She said that the woman who moved to the exit row was originally seated in [in a different area]; and that many customers had their masks off in that area; so she requested to move else where; and that's why she moved. I told other Flight Attendant that I did notice a lot more than usual with their masks off or down; especially in those first few rows of [that area]. Especially the [commuting] pilot and the guy behind him. Other flight attendant said the woman said something about a crew member not wearing a mask. There were a few flight attendants commuting; too; but they all had their masks on that I knew of. Later; inflight I spoke to the woman who moved; and I apologized and told her that it was not okay that they weren't wearing their masks; and that I did tell them to put them on and they did. She said she was especially appalled that a pilot wasn't wearing one; and said she was traveling to see a family member and was stressed enough. I gave her [a voucher] and offered her wine or beer; which she would have gotten in her [original] seat anyway. She seemed calmer and thanked me a lot.Later; I spoke with the [commuting] pilot and reminded him the importance of wearing masks around customers; and that one did move herself back because he wasn't wearing his. After I told him the first time (before door was closed) to put it back on; he kept it on except when eating or drinking. The man behind him; however; I told twice more (three times total including before door was closed) to put his mask on. Once inflight when I was collecting trash and he was sleeping. He had his mask all the way below his chin; near the collar of his shirt so that it didn't even look like he had one there. And another before landing; when I was doing my final compliance check. There was another guy in main cabin who fell asleep twice and I had to shake him awake and remind him to put his mask up; but his was covering his mouth; it just wasn't over his nose. I checked on the customer in XYA again and told her I spoke with that pilot again; and he has complied with mask requirement since the door was closed. Hopefully he just forgot and takes the mask requirement seriously. I only told him once; so I'm not sure how long he had it off or if he was eating before and just forgot to put it back on. I spoke with flight deck before I spoke with that commuter because our paper work and guest service tool app did not say there was a non-rev seated in Z4. So I asked FD if maybe he was listed as jumpseater; which didn't make sense because there were enough seats for all the non-revs to get on and he had higher priority. So I told FD about the customer complaint about that commuting pilot. When I spoke with him; he said he asked gate agent for a seat without the bulkhead; since he was originally given seat A3. So it seemed the woman who was seated in Z3; was swapped to A3. And the pilot was moved to Z4. I'm not sure exactly.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that many passengers; including a commuting pilot; were not compliant with the face mask policy.,"The incident involved a flight attendant addressing multiple instances of non-compliance with the face mask policy during a flight. The primary cause was several passengers, including a commuting pilot, not adhering to the mask requirements. During the boarding and pre-flight processes, the flight attendant noticed that some individuals, particularly in the exit rows and front sections of the aircraft, had their masks down or off. These included a pilot who initially had his mask around his chin and a passenger seated behind him who had his mask completely off. The flight attendant reminded these individuals to properly wear their masks, and most complied after being asked. A passenger originally seated in a different area moved herself to an exit row, citing concerns about the lack of mask compliance in her original seat area. She later explained that she was stressed and had relocated due to the pilot's mask policy violation. The flight attendant apologized for the situation, provided a voucher, and offered refreshments to the passenger, who appeared calmer afterward. The flight attendant also addressed the commuting pilot again during the flight, reminding him of the importance of mask compliance. The pilot complied after the reminder, and the flight attendant confirmed with the flight deck that the pilot had adhered to the policy post-reminder. The incident was resolved through the flight attendant's reminders and communication with the affected individuals, and no further issues were reported during the flight.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, operational issues, mask policy, communication issues"

I told them once we're finished boarding we can see if there's empty seats or you can talk to the gate agent if not. One of them sits across in XX4 for time being. Customer Service Agent (CSA) comes on and says someone else is assigned that seat. He goes back to see who should be in that seat; comes back and finds him sitting in row XY next to someone; I guess they knew each other. So the other customer stays in XX4.The customer in Y2 was also seated next to a stranger; and asked about moving up to row 1. I said unfortunately because we have seating caps; first class is at its max up there. I said once CSA comes back you can talk to him. I go to get a trash bag to collect the purell wipes; and he's right behind me when I turn around. I was confused why he was there all of a sudden. He said he would go talk to the gate agent. I told him to make sure he has all his bags if he's stepping off; but didn't understand why he didn't just wait for GA to come back. Because he had to come back to sort out the customers in row XX. And he asked why he had to take his things; thinking that meant he'd miss the flight. I asked why not just wait in your seat until the gate agent comes back; and he calmed down and nodded; saying that's a better idea. I guess he didn't hear me when I initially told him to wait for CSA to come back. Then CSA comes on and finishes sorting [out] XX12. Then he talks to Y2 and says exactly what I told him about seat caps; maybe he told him something more I'm not sure. Y2 kept complaining about the whole row 1 being open; and why can't he sit there; as if nobody explained the covid seating caps to him (both me and CSA did).Then; I finish collecting wipes and notice XX2 has a lace mask. Like lacey dress or underwear material; super thin with holes in it. And I ask if she has a regular mask without holes; or we can give one to her. And she has a startled/insulted look on her face; and says how she needs the holes because 'I can only breathe out of my left nostril.' I told her if it's a medical concern; it's not showing up on our end; and we weren't informed of any passengers with medical exceptions. So we would need to talk to the CSA and get that on your booking; so you can get an exception. And then she says how she flew with that mask from ZZZ; and it was fine. I told her it was possible nobody noticed on those flights; and unfortunately it's not allowed. Even if nobody else noticed before; that doesn't mean I can ignore it when I notice.So I go back up and flag down the CSA as he's closing the jetbridge doors. And I ask him about any medical exceptions; and he said nobody was approved for that and that he didn't notice anyone with a lace mask. So he says he'll be back with a mask. We have masks onboard but it was better he did that because she was already giving me attitude about it. He comes back and asks who it was and I said XX2; one of the ones we were talking with earlier. He goes back and gives her the mask and comes back saying how she told him that she wore that mask from ZZZ and I that he told her that it doesn't matter what happened on previous flights. Basically the same stuff from when I spoke to her.She got past him during boarding; then the other FA up front; then me in back during the whole seat issue; and then the GA again when he helped with the seat issue. And it wasn't until near departure time that I even noticed. So I think there's a good chance that on her other flights; those CSAs and FAs didn't notice either.Also; it was obvious she didn't have a medical exemption because she told me she needs a hole-y mask since she can only breathe out of 1 nostril. What I did not tell her was that she was speaking to a FA who hasn't been able to breathe out of either nostril in years because of a medical issue; and I was wearing a regular mask just fine. Iwould feel blessed if I could breathe out of even just one nostril. Somehow she didn't think that breathing out of one's mouth alone is possible in a mask. And I know I'm not the only FA with a similar sinus issue; too; and we all wear regular masks.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that several passengers had seat location issues and another passenger was not wearing a proper face mask.,"The incident occurred during a flight, involving several passengers and the flight attendant (FA). The first issue arose when passengers in seats XX1 and XX2 requested to move due to discomfort sitting next to strangers. The FA explained that seat assignments would be sorted by the Customer Service Agent (CSA) upon boarding completion. One passenger moved to seat XX4, which was initially assigned to another passenger. The CSA eventually resolved the seating arrangement.
The second issue involved a passenger in seat Y2, who sought to move to row 1 but was informed that first class was at capacity. The passenger grew agitated and insisted on speaking to the gate agent. The FA advised the passenger to wait for the CSA, who later confirmed the seating restrictions. Despite efforts to explain, the passenger continued to complain about the seating policy. The final issue occurred when the FA noticed a passenger in seat XX2 wearing a lace mask with holes, which violated the airline's mask policy. The passenger explained that the mask was necessary due to a medical condition, but the FA noted that no medical exception had been filed. The FA referred the passenger to the CSA, who provided a proper mask. The passenger was initially resistant but ultimately complied. The incident was resolved when the CSA ensured the passenger in seat XX2 complied with the mask policy, and the other passengers were reassigned seats as needed.","safety related, operational issues, communication issues, mask policy, between attendant and passengers"

Any crew in the future will have problems getting compliance.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger would not comply with face mask policy.,"The incident involved a passenger (Passenger A) seated in [seat] X3 who repeatedly failed to comply with the airline's COVID-19 mask policy during the flight. Flight Attendants, including A, B, D, and F, made multiple requests for Passenger A to properly wear his mask. Despite these requests, Passenger A was observed pulling his mask below his nose multiple times, including after being reminded by the crew. The crew discussed issuing a warning but did not do so due to safety concerns during descent. Passenger A's non-compliant behavior was noted, and it was anticipated that he may cause similar issues on future flights. No formal action was taken during the flight, but the crew expressed concern about his behavior and the potential for future non-compliance.","mask policy, safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, communication issues, disruptive, between attendant and passengers"

After we did the demo I walked back to compliance and saw that the mother; in [seat] XX4; the face mask was below her nose and when I got closer she pulled it up. The three kids in [seats] XX 123 pulled their masks up and kept them on. I turned to the mother and said that 'I need your mask to stay over your nose at all times.' As I'm saying this she has it pinched between her finger pulled away from her face. She snapped back; 'It's there or it's covering' something along those lines and dismissively continued her conversation with the woman across from her. When I walked to the front of the plane before the demo I told the woman in XX3 to follow the mask policy so XX4 knew we were enforcing it. After my first encounter I informed the crew that I already talked to her and received attitude back and for them to keep an eye out.My second encounter was shortly after that when I went to pass out the [snacks] to the family next to her. As I walked up the mask again was down below her nose and when she saw me there she moved it up. I told her I really need her to keep the mask up and she snapped that it was up. I said it wasn't a moment ago and that I didn't want to have any issues on this long flight. Her responses to that was did I know that the politicians didn't believe in masks and I told her that this wasn't political; it was me doing my job to enforce our policy. She continued to give me attitude and talking about it was political. I went to the back and informed Flight Attendant (FA) C and D how my second encounter went and that she would be an issue the remainder of the flight and I strongly believe we should give her the Warning. They both offered to be the one to talk and give it to her. Flight Attendant C took care of that.While passing out the snack mix; I got to the row the husband was in. He asked for the wife's snack and his mask was down and FA D asked him to make sure his mask was up. XX4 had some kind of response that I missed but FA D told her not to have attitude towards us when we were just doing our job. Then she responded as a victim; saying she's been yelled at the whole flight and that she has been talking to us respectfully and not yelling at us. Which is not the truth because my encounters with her were very unpleasant; disrespectful and had the intent to belittle me and the policy.The remainder of the flight the entire family didn't comply with the mask policy. Their son rarely had the mask on when I passed; the daughters below their nose and the husband as well even though he would pull it up as we passed by. We all spoke to the family at one point and most of us multiple times. The mother was constantly having the mask below her nose or pulling the mask away from her face as she spoke to her kids and the woman across from her. I also was informed that another guest moved his seat because he was so uncomfortable sitting in front of them. I was told after everyone was off that they didn't have their mask on properly while deplaning either.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a family would not comply with face mask policy.,"The incident involved a flight attendant attempting to enforce the face mask policy with a family onboard. The family, particularly the mother, repeatedly failed to comply and displayed disrespectful behavior. The flight attendant addressed the family multiple times, escalating the situation. Another crew member eventually intervened, but the family continued to disregard the policy. Their non-compliance caused discomfort for other passengers, with one moving seats. Despite efforts, the policy wasn't followed, and the flight attendant reported the incident upon landing. The summary remains neutral, focusing on facts without judgment.","mask policy, crew-related issues, between attendant and passengers"

I asked her to cover her nose and mouth with her mask. She does not comply. She asks 'does this plane have oxygen? I can't wear this mask.'  I ask her if she is telling me she has a condition that requires oxygen during the flight then she needs to bring an approved Oxygen Canister on the flight. Meanwhile the passenger in [seat] YY1 sits down; mask below nose; and will not comply with many requests from me to pull her mask to cover her nose. I call the Captain to have him contact a Supervisor to remove these passengers and to let him know the passenger who sat in ZZ1 was demanding that I administer oxygen. Now a young man is trying to sit in ZZ2. I ask if that is his assigned seat. He was assigned [seat] XX2 I ask him to sit in his assigned seat.  He complies. Then a passenger shows up in [seat] YY2. He gets inside my personal space and is belly to belly with me saying he doesn't like how I am talking to these passengers.  [Passenger in seat] ZZ1 is asking me what was I going to do. And I told them that I had called the Captain to get someone to take them off because everyone has to properly wear a mask. I was hemmed in by passenger [in seat] YY2. I finally got past him and went up front. At that point Paramedics came and took the passenger in [seat] ZZ1 off in an aisle chair.  The station manager finally shows up and I tell her removal for mask compliance of passenger in [seat] YY1 and passenger in [seat] YY2 [is necessary] for interference of crew member duties.  All said and done the whole party was removed from the flight.,,,,Flight Attendant reported several passengers were removed from the flight because they would not comply with face mask policy and were interfering with cabin crew duties.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant encountered multiple passengers who refused to comply with the face mask policy on board the aircraft. The first passenger, seated in XX1, was observed with her mask below her nose and did not adhere to requests to properly cover her nose and mouth. She questioned the oxygen policy, prompting the flight attendant to inquire if she required an oxygen canister, which she did not provide. Another passenger in seat YY1 similarly failed to comply with mask requirements, despite repeated requests. The flight attendant contacted the captain, who in turn reached out to a supervisor to address the situation. A passenger attempting to sit in the incorrect seat (XX2) was redirected to his assigned seat, which he complied with. However, another passenger in seat YY2 became confrontational, invading the flight attendant's personal space and expressing dissatisfaction with her approach. The flight attendant informed the passengers that those not complying with mask policies would be removed, and she summoned the captain again. Paramedics arrived and removed the passenger in seat ZZ1 from the flight. The station manager later arrived and was informed that the passengers in seats YY1 and YY2 needed to be removed for mask non-compliance and interference with crew duties. As a result, all identified passengers were removed from the flight, allowing the journey to continue safely. The solution involved ensuring compliance with mask policies and addressing interference with crew duties through passenger removal.","crew-related issues, emergency, mask policy, passenger-related issues, between attendant and passengers"

There was a [reward system passenger] sitting behind me in [seat] Y4 and his traveling partner in [seat] Y6. This was my first flight back after a COVID exposure from the plane. During boarding I asked Y6 to make sure her mask stayed over her nose. She said it kept falling down. I offered one of ours but she declined. During the safety demo I once again asked her to pull up her mask. As soon as we took off they both removed their masks. Multiple times I asked them to put their masks on. When we were cleaning up for landing the passenger in Y4 started shouting at me asking for my name. He said because he had a drink in front of him he didn't need to put on his mask. I once again explained our policy was that it was only supposed to be removed briefly. He said he had been on 7 different flights and nobody had asked him to put on his mask. I was the first one. I called the B Flight Attendant to join the conversation. She reiterated our policy. After talking to him for a while he said he was extremely frustrated with the inconsistency of mask policy enforcement. He calmed down when we all agreed there should be more consistency with enforcing or explaining our mask policy.Just wanted to write this up as a safety issue. He also said he would be writing in to Airline.  As a [person in the reward system] not sure if he knew better and just didn't want to wear the mask or if nobody on other flights has actually enforced our mask policy. But as someone who travels as often as he does. He clearly needs some clarification.,,,,Flight attendant reported a passenger was not compliant with face mask policy.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a flight attendant (Party 1) noticed a passenger (Party 2) and their traveling partner were not complying with the face mask policy. During boarding, the flight attendant asked the passenger in seat Y6 to ensure her mask was properly covering her nose, but she declined, stating the mask kept falling down. The flight attendant offered a replacement mask, which was also declined. During the safety demonstration, the flight attendant again reminded the passenger to adjust her mask. After takeoff, both passengers removed their masks despite the flight attendant's repeated requests to comply with the policy. The passenger in seat Y4 became confrontational, stating he did not need to wear a mask while drinking and claiming it was the first time he had been asked to do so on any of his seven previous flights. He expressed frustration over inconsistent enforcement of the mask policy. The flight attendant called another flight attendant (Party 2) to assist, who reiterated the policy. After discussing the issue, the passenger calmed down when the flight attendants acknowledged the need for more consistent enforcement or clearer communication of the policy. The passenger indicated he would file a complaint with the airline, and the flight attendant noted the need for consistency in mask policy enforcement across flights.","mask policy, safety related, operational issues, between attendant and passengers"

Since this was the second time I used the last approach to try to get her to comply. I spoke with her about her mask she said she couldn't wear it because she was drinking coffee I said I understand but as the announcement states if she isn't actively drinking she has to replace her mask. She then pulled her mask up and said this is ridiculous. I walked back to my galley and informed my A FA that I had spoken with her again about her mask because she had removed it again. At that point we had made the decision that once inflight we would have the Captain make another general announcement reminding everyone to wear a mask. When I walked through the cabin for my final compliance check before landing she had her mask on.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger not complying with face mask policy.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and a passenger (Party2) regarding compliance with the face mask policy. During the flight, the flight attendant conducted safety demonstrations and final safety checks. After being informed by another attendant that the passenger (seated in XX1) was not wearing her mask, the flight attendant approached the passenger twice to address the issue. The passenger initially refused to comply, citing that she was drinking coffee. The flight attendant explained that the mask must be worn unless actively drinking, and the passenger reluctantly complied. To ensure compliance, the flight attendant and the other attendant decided to have the captain make a general announcement reminding passengers to wear their masks.

I again asked the Captain to put his mask on; once again pointing to my mask with both hands this time.   The Captain just turned and looked forward out the window in front of him.  He would not verbally reply nor put on a mask.   He refused to follow company policy.   We did not speak the entire time I was up there for their break - he looked out the window; I stood silently by the door.     I had to stand there in the cockpit and potentially be exposed to COVID-19 and the serious consequences that could ensue.   It is my understanding that COVID policies apply to everyone!    When the First Officer swapped out; I said something to him about the captain refusing to comply with policies and procedures and being disrespectful.

Passenger boarded the plane without wearing a mask and took a seat in X1. The Fwd FA approached and reminded passenger about the required mask policy. Passenger reluctantly complied and as the FA turned to walk away; the passenger called her an '[expletive]'. After the FA informed us about this; I first asked the FA if passenger is being disruptive. The FA stated that passenger was not. I then asked if she would like me to go speak to the passenger. The FA stated that was not necessary. Finally; I asked if she would like me to request a customer service representative. The FA again said no; the situation is under control and she would let us know if the problem continues. I messaged my Dispatcher to keep them in the loop of what was said. We pushed; de-iced; and while taxing to our assigned runway; I asked the FO to call and make sure there were no further issues in the back. The FA stated that the passenger had fallen asleep; so we elected to continue. About mid-way through the flight; the Fwd FA called up and stated that the passenger had woken up and was starting to cause some disturbances. The FO was already the PF and I asked him to take radios as well. The passenger asked for a cup of water so passenger didn't have to wear the mask because she was 'drinking'. The FAs let this go on for about '30 minutes' (quoting them) and the passenger had not drank any of the water. Passenger again was non-compliant with the mask and both FAs asked passenger three times to wear the mask. At this point; I sent another message asking for a customer service representative to meet us at the gate in ZZZ1 and explained to the Dispatcher everything the FAs had told me. About 5 minutes after that; the Fwd FA called up again. Again; I told the FO his controls; his radios. The FA then explained that the passenger was now starting to 'scream' on the plane and yelled very loudly; '#@%^! I'm not from [foreign country]!' While doing this; proceeded to flip off both FAs. I again messaged our Dispatcher with this information and now requested Security along with the customer service representative. The FAs and I talked back forth regarding passenger danger level. The passenger was remaining in the seat and making no other threatening gestures; so we did not see the need to declare an Emergency. We continued the flight to ZZZ1 with no further incidences. After landing; I had the FO call Ops just to make sure a customer service representative and security were waiting for us at the gate. Upon arrival into the gate; a customer service representative and security officer where indeed right there. The customer service representative immediately came onto the plane and removed the passenger.The FAs did not make any indication and no one told me they suspected the passenger was drunk. Seems as if passenger was just a genuinely disturbed person.We probably should have gotten security or customer service involved at ZZZ because of the name calling. Because the passenger had put on the mask and was making no further threatening behavior; we decided to make a note of it and continue. We all agreed though; that if passenger made one more derogatory comment; we would most likely be removing passenger from the flight. We had no further problems until mid-flight.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger was not compliant with mask policy and being disruptive. Captain reported multiple interruptions during the flight in order to communicate with company about the situation.,"During a flight operated by the air carrier, a passenger exhibited non-compliance with the mask policy and disruptive behavior, leading to multiple interruptions and communication with the company. The incident began during boarding when the passenger boarded without a mask, was reminded by the flight attendant (FA), and reluctantly complied. However, the passenger cursed the FA after she turned away. The FA informed the flight crew, and the captain was informed. The captain assessed the situation, determined it was under control, and communicated with dispatch to keep them informed. The flight proceeded, but the passenger became disruptive again mid-flight, refusing to wear the mask and claiming to be ""drinking"" to avoid it. The FAs allowed this for about 30 minutes, but the passenger did not drink. When the passenger continued to be non-compliant, the FAs repeatedly asked her to wear the mask, prompting the captain to request a customer service representative and security. The passenger eventually screamed and flipped off the FAs, leading the captain to message dispatch again and request security. Despite the passenger's disruptive behavior, no emergency was declared. The flight continued to its destination, and upon landing, security and a customer service representative were present. The passenger was removed from the aircraft by the customer service representative. The FAs did not suspect the passenger was intoxicated but believed she was disturbed. The crew agreed that earlier intervention, such as involving security or a customer service representative, could have been warranted due to the initial name-calling.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, disruptive, communication issues, between attendant and passengers"

Passengers were advised they had an agreement at ticket purchase this had been clear this was not an optional requirement for flight.Using this method passenger realized this wasn't a joke and removal would occur.  Captain advised FA B to do walk through for compliance and removal before door closer option.  This passenger had been advised over 3 times by 3 different individuals with non-compliance results and now aware airlines was serious about compliance.Entire plane was compliant during walking through and continued flight.

I told that passenger his mask must come over his nose and mouth. He responded 'He will try.' I then offered him a company approved surgical mask that were provided by the company. He responded 'No thanks.' That was the first time of me asking him to put his mask on properly. During my compliant check before doing the safety demo; the mask was down again. I told him once again about the mask. That was the second time. During cabin service the mask was down again and I had to remind him once more. Once cabin service was over and passengers were given time to eat and drink; I then went around to collect trash and he was asleep with his mask down. I called out to him and he opened his eyes and I told him for the third time about his mask. Once we got to the final descent his mask was down and I reminded him once again for the fourth time. Once I told him this time he just looked at me and shook his head. This passenger and his wife; were both sick. They were both coughing without covering their cough. The couple kept coughing during takeoff; throughout the flight and landing. The coughing drew the attention of other passengers to look. People are very scared and when they hear coughing and other passengers not wearing mask properly they worry.  Many verbal warnings were given.,,,,Flight attendant reported two passengers were coughing throughout the flight and not adhering to face mask policy.,"The incident occurred during a flight on Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1.

Now after pilots inform us that we are departing; Passenger X completely takes off his mask; passengers around him are looking uncomfortably anxious and he is looking to see if I am can see him.  Although the lights are dim in the cabin I can still see him and he sees me. I do a friendly gesture so he can put it on. He completely ignores me.

As the flight attendant greeted passengers and distributed wipes, they noticed Passenger X boarding the aircraft with a mask that barely covered their nose or mouth, along with their family. The flight attendant politely requested that Passenger X and their family ensure their masks were properly worn. Initially, the family complied, but after the pilots announced the departure, Passenger X removed their mask entirely. Passengers nearby appeared uncomfortable, and Passenger X seemed to be deliberately testing the flight attendant's response. Despite dim lighting in the cabin, the flight attendant could see Passenger X and gestured for them to reapply their mask. Passenger X ignored this gesture. When the flight reached 10,000 feet, the flight attendant approached Passenger X and kindly reminded them to wear their mask properly. Passenger X complied briefly but removed their mask again as the flight attendant walked away. When informed of the face mask policy announcements, Passenger X did not comply and argued with the flight attendant, questioning why they were being targeted. The flight attendant then informed the pilots, who advised giving one final reminder. After three gentle reminders, Passenger X, their spouse, and their children finally complied with the mask policy. The incident was resolved without further issues, and the flight attendant ensured compliance with the face mask policy throughout the remainder of the flight.","mask policy, disruptive, operational issues, between attendant and passengers"

About 3 to 4 minutes later 2 cleaners came up the airstairs and boarded. One had an electric vacuum in hand the other had [a] trash bag in hand. Shortly after a 3rd cleaner came on board with a bag of supplies and boarded the aircraft and put [the] bag down by the First Class Lavatory. About 5 minutes later another cleaner (gentleman with nothing in his hands) came up the airstairs and boarded the aircraft. Within 10 to 15 seconds the first 2 cleaners came off the aircraft and right after them the other gentleman came off the aircraft saying 'we are good to go.' One of my crewmember's asked him was the aircraft sprayed. He repeated 'we were good to go' and proceeded to exit the jetbridge door and down the airstairs. I and the other crew member both said I don't think the aircraft was sprayed as neither of us saw the cone being put in place nor did we see the sprayer. At this time the last cleaner with the bag with supplies came off. I asked her has this aircraft been sprayed? She said what did he say; I said he said yes; she proceeded to exit the aircraft.  I said can you please show me what you have in that bag; because if there is no sprayer in there; then there is no way our aircraft has been sprayed. She then said 'I will tell him to come back.' At this time the Gate Agent came down to see if we were ready to board. I explained the situation to the Agent and she said 'oh no I am so sorry; that's not right.' The Captain was on the jetbridge with us and we were all in agreement that we needed to be sprayed before we could start boarding. The previous gentleman came back up the airstairs with sprayer in hand and sprayed aircraft. When he was done; without further delay; we boarded and departed. The Gate Agent was very apologetic about the incident.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a cleaning crew had to be reminded to properly sanitize the aircraft prior to passenger boarding.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant noticed the aircraft was not properly sanitized prior to boarding. The cleaning crew initially boarded with limited equipment, leading to confusion about whether the aircraft had been sprayed.

We had two through Passengers onboard that were continuing on to ZZZ1.  I had a great conversation with them while I was tidying the aircraft.  Our D Flight Attendant was the first Inbound Crew Member to leave the plane.  There was a female Outbound Crew Member that came on to help clean; as well as a COVID-19 Cleaner from the Ramp. A second Outbound Crew Member came onboard as well; he stood in the forward entry area.  I heard the Inbound A Flight Attendant ask him if all of the Outbound Crew Members were at the gate; I guess he said yes because she collected her things walked off the plane.  The COVID-19 Cleaner and the Outbound Crew Member that helped us clean walked off the plane as well.  I also noticed that there was an Above the Wing Supervisor standing in the jet-bridge.  I think he was there because we arrived late and it was an aircraft booked FULL out of ZZZ to ZZZ1.  The two through passengers had moved from the back of the aircraft to the front of the aircraft and sat in row two.  They were seated below the overhead bin where my crew luggage was stowed; and they were asking me if they could use the lavatory.  I brought my things down and thanked the male Outbound Crew Member for stepping onto the plane.  I think that all of my other Crew Members had already walked off the plane; and that I was the last Inbound Crew Member to step off the plane.  This is the part were the COVID-19 Brain Fog comes in.  I'm not sure if the B Flight Attendant or myself was the last Inbound Crew Member to leave the plane.  I do know that there was only one Outbound Crew Member onboard an aircraft with through passengers onboard.  There was a lot going on during the crew change and I didn't think about having two Outbound Crew Members onboard before leaving the aircraft.  Three months ago I had an on the job COVID-19 infection; and I was off work for three months recovering.  I still have a couple of the COVID-19 'Long-haul' symptoms such as Brain Fog and some occasional fatigue.

The Flight Attendant cited long lasting symptoms from COVID-19 that may have contributed to the event.,"A flight attendant reported a potential violation of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) due to insufficient crew during a crew change while passengers were onboard. The incident occurred when a flight attendant, Party1, was unsure whether the minimum number of flight attendants was present before leaving the aircraft. During the crew change, confusion arose as to who was on the plane, with only one outbound crew member present despite having through passengers. This uncertainty led to a possible FAR violation. The contributing factor was Party1's long-term COVID-19 symptoms, including brain fog and fatigue, which may have affected their ability to ensure compliance. To address this, the solution proposed is to verify the number of outbound crew members before leaving the aircraft, ensuring adherence to safety regulations.","safety related, crew-related issues, health and medical issues, between attendant and crew"

During final compliance checks before landing her mask was down again and she was touching her nose. I told her to pull her mask up again. She refused and said she needed to blow her nose because of an ear issue. I told her she can pull her mask up over her nose and mouth and then pinch her nose over the mask and blow to relieve the pressure. She refused. I told her again that regardless her mask needs to cover her nose and mouth and continued my compliance checks. She ignored me and kept her mask down for landing. The couple did not take the mask policy seriously and ignored my warnings as if they were merely suggestions. They were blatantly non-compliant and they did not require their daughter to wear her mask at any time either.I believe that the couple should be placed on the mask noncompliance list because of their blatant non-compliant behavior and the way they ignored my instructions. There was not time during the flight to issue the warning or to call the pilots to arrange for [customer service] to meet the flight because we were in final descent during sterile cockpit.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a family was non-compliant with face mask policy throughout the flight.,"The incident arose due to Passengers X and Y, along with their daughter, refusing to comply with the face mask policy throughout the flight. Despite being asked multiple times, they disregarded the flight attendant's instructions, leaving their masks improperly positioned or removed. The flight attendant repeatedly requested the passengers to adhere to the mask policy. Initially compliant, they later ignored these requests, continuing to lower their masks and touch their faces. During final compliance checks before landing, the passengers again refused to comply, citing an ear issue. The attendant suggested a workaround, but they refused, leading to a refusal to comply during landing. The attendant recommended adding the passengers to a non-compliance list.

Every part of the flight (boarding; climb; cruise; etc.) seemed to be going fine and seemed standard. When the pilots told us to prepare the cabin for arrival; I decided to look over the PAX (Passenger) manifest before tossing it. I had used it during the flight but only looked at part of it. To be honest; I didn't read over it before we departed. When I read over it toward the end of the flight; I noticed that one PAX was listed as a Special Assistance Passenger. This PAX was listed as needing a wheelchair and as blind. At no point was I aware that we had a PAX with a visual impairment. The PAX was boarded first and the person who pushed his wheelchair stowed the PAX's luggage. When interacting with the PAX on boarding; I handed him a sanitizing wipe and he seemed to have no trouble getting the wipe from me or getting to his seat; although I didn't really watch him go to his seat. At no point did the gate agent inform us that we had a PAX with a visual impairment nor did the person who pushed the wheelchair. When the B Flight Attendant asked the gate agent if we had any specials (for the PAX count form) the gate agent said we had one wheelchair. There was no mention of a PAX with a visual impairment.We did the standard briefings (announcements and safety demo); but neither of us provided a one-on-one briefing with the PAX. We were unaware of his visual impairment. After I realized our mistake on descent; I wasn't sure what to do. I had a brief conversation with the PAX; and he seemed to look me in the eye for the conversation. After I played the final descent announcement; I showed the B Flight Attendant the manifest and how it showed a PAX listed as blind. She was surprised to see it. We discussed our situation in regard to the PAX and the possibility of writing a  report.After we landed; the PAX gathered his belongings and deplaned without help. He also told the person waiting with the wheelchair that he didn't need it. He was traveling alone and without the assistance of a service animal. He only used a simple walking cane; not a red and white cane frequently used by people with visual impairments. He gave me no reason to think that he was visually impaired; but I understand that some disabilities are not apparent. When all the PAX had deplaned; I informed the Captain of what had happened and asked for advice. He said to fill out an report because we didn't do a required briefing. The B Flight Attendant and I knew that one-on-one briefings are required; we didn't know the PAX was visually impaired.I am concerned and upset that we potentially caused a safety incident with a PAX with a visual impairment. This is unacceptable. I hope to use this as a learning experience and pay closer attention to the PAX manifest before shutting the boarding door and proactively asking all gate agents about special assist PAX that we may have onboard. I say this with caution; though. We don't always receive the correct manifest; we sometimes receive incomplete manifests with no PAX information; and sometimes we don't even receive a manifest at all. While in the end; it was my responsibility to confirm with the gate agent about special assist PAX; I feel like there was a breakdown of communication between the gate agent and me. I wonder if the gate agent knew there was a visually impaired PAX on the flight. Perhaps there could be strengthened training for gate agents and flight attendants for recognizing special assist PAX. For flight attendants; also what to do if a special assist PAX is discovered during flight and certain briefings did not occur; as in our case. As stated before; I didn't know what to do in regard to the PAX.I understand the severe safety hazards not providing a one-on-one briefing could have caused if something went wrong during flight. I hope to use this as a lesson learned and not solely rely on being informed of all special assist PAX by a gate agent. In other words; I need to be more proactive; and I need to use my resources more wisely. My hope is that this can be used as a lesson for all flight attendants so that incidents like this don't happen again. We are first and foremost a safety industry; and we failed to keep to our safety standards.,,,,Flight Attendant reported not performing safety briefing for blind passenger.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant (Party 1) who failed to provide a required one-on-one safety briefing to a visually impaired passenger (PAX) onboard the flight. The PAX was listed in the passenger manifest as needing a wheelchair and being blind, but the Flight Attendant was unaware of this until reviewing the manifest toward the end of the flight. This oversight occurred despite the manifest indicating the PAX's visual impairment. The Flight Attendant did not receive any communication from the gate agent or ground personnel about the PAX's condition. During the flight, standard safety briefings were conducted, but no special briefing was provided to the visually impaired passenger. Upon realizing the mistake during descent, the Flight Attendant briefly spoke with the PAX, who appeared to manage without assistance. After landing, the PAX deplaned independently, using only a simple walking cane, and declined the wheelchair assistance offered. The Flight Attendant reported the incident to the Captain, who advised filing a report due to the missed safety briefing, which is a regulatory requirement. The Flight Attendant expressed concern about the potential safety risks and acknowledged the need for improved communication and proactive verification of special assistance passengers. They proposed strengthening training for both flight attendants and ground personnel to better identify and address the needs of visually impaired passengers. Additionally, the Flight Attendant emphasized the importance of reviewing the passenger manifest before boarding and proactively confirming special assistance requirements with ground staff.","crew-related issues, operational issues, passenger-related issues, between attendant and passengers"

During the flight FA B approached the galley and states to me that she was going to give Passenger X a face mask warning; because he was having a hard time complying to keeping the mask over his nose and she asked on numerous occasions before pushback; taxing out to the runway; and during the flight to keep his mask over his nose. I called flight deck to inform the Captain what was about to happen. So FA B gave the written policy to Passenger X and he stated he didn't want to see it. FA B informs me what happened and I call the flight deck. I tell the Captain she gave the warning and Passenger X refuses to hear it. The Captain states we'll just call for supervisors to meet us at the gate. FA B and I both say 'okay.' I decide to do a walk through in the cabin and notice Passenger X has his mask on covering his nose and mouth. I inform FA B and the Captain. Captain states that's great; but so there's no further issues with Passenger X we'll still have the Supervisor meet us. I say 'fine.' I guess noticing that FA B and myself are talking to the Captain inflight; Passenger X states to FA B he now wants to read the policy. Once seeing the policy and reading it Passenger X states to FA B that he's sorry. FA B then calls the Captain to let him know Passenger X has a change of heart. Captain still states he'll have the Supervisor meet the aircraft at the gate. We say 'okay.' Once at the gate; I open the main door and the supervisors are there. They wait for Passenger X to deplane to talk to him. The supervisors also state they will inform his connecting flight.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger would not comply with face mask policy and was met at the arrival gate by supervisors.,"The incident began when a flight attendant, FA B, repeatedly requested Passenger X to comply with the face mask policy during the flight. Despite multiple requests, Passenger X refused to keep his mask properly positioned. FA B then provided a written policy warning, which Passenger X initially rejected. The flight attendant notified the captain, who decided to involve supervisors at the gate. During the flight, Passenger X reconsidered, read the policy, and apologized to FA B. However, the captain instructed the supervisors to meet the aircraft upon arrival. The supervisors were present when the plane landed and addressed Passenger X as he deplaned, subsequently informing his connecting flight about the situation. This summary outlines the cause, process, and outcome of the incident, maintaining neutrality and conciseness.","mask policy, safety related, between attendant and passengers"

The Flight Attendant repeatedly requested compliance, made announcements, and informed the Captain and Gate Agent about the issue. The Captain, in turn, addressed the passengers over the public address system. A designated Supervisor was brought in by the Gate Agent, who also made an announcement emphasizing the need to follow the company's mask policy, warning that non-compliant passengers could face removal from the flight. Initially, the passengers complied, but during a later walk-through, the Flight Attendant discovered that all the previously non-compliant passengers had removed their masks entirely. The Flight Attendant notified the Captain, who instructed her to document the seat numbers of the non-compliant individuals.

Passenger X is seated at X5. Another passenger flagged me and said that Passenger X was not wearing a mask; and that he was coughing.  Passenger X was sleeping and I roused him on the arm and gave him his mask to put on; as he had placed the mask on his armrest. He put on his mask.  But sometime shortly before arrival (maybe 30 minutes before); I found him again without a mask and tried to rouse him. But this time he was wearing huge noise cancellation headphones and would not respond to any tapping or rousing; and no response to my calling his name.  He had drank some liquor during the flight; but not enough that he could not be roused.  I believe he was ignoring me on purpose and pretending to sleep; and had put the headsets on as an excuse to not hear me. Then the Captain called me that we had to prep the cabin early due to expected turbulence before landing.We then proceeded to do prep for landing. I again attempted to rouse Passenger X as his seat was reclined.  And again; no response. I had to physically push his chair upright; as he would not respond to do it himself.  Then I tried to rouse him again; tapping him; calling his name; and telling him to put on his mask. He finally slowly came awake. I put his mask in his hand (he again had put it on his armrest) and told him repeatedly to put on his mask.  He finally complied. And as he was leaving the airplane; I saw him again take off his mask at the jetbridge.I believe Passenger X was doing everything on purpose; and that he was awake and just pretending to sleep.  He would have had to have taken copious amounts of liquor to not have been aware of me rousing him; tapping him; or calling his name.  He also had this huge headphones on.  I feel strongly concerned about the possibility that he had done this before; and likely gotten away with it too.   I am putting this on for the record; so there will be something to refer to in case he does it again.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger was non-compliant with face mask policy during flight.,"The incident involved a flight attendant addressing a passenger's non-compliance with the face mask policy during the flight. The passenger, identified as Passenger X, was first observed without a mask and coughing, prompting the attendant to wake him and ensure he wore his mask. However, approximately 30 minutes before landing, the attendant found Passenger X again without a mask, with headphones on, ignoring attempts to rouse him. Despite evidence suggesting intentional non-compliance, Passenger X eventually complied after the attendant physically adjusted his seat and reiterated the mask requirement. Notably, Passenger X removed his mask upon exiting the aircraft. The attendant suspected prior instances of similar behavior and documented the incident to facilitate future reference if recurrence occurs. The summary highlights the passenger's intentional disregard for the policy, the attendant's repeated attempts to enforce compliance, and the eventual, albeit partial, resolution of the issue.","safety related, passenger-related issues, mask policy, disruptive, between attendant and passengers"

He proceeded to pull down his mask and sit down. I asked him at that point to please pull up mask; it's airline's policy to wear mask over nose and mouth. He stared at me but pulled it up. Once in the air; during service; he had his face covering below his nose. I asked him if there was a reason he wasn't following Airline's policy; he replied 'Listen I don't know what you're talking about.' So I repeated the policy to him and asked him to pull up his mask. He was very defiant but pulled up his face covering.,,Passenger X's mask was down when boarding I asked him to pull up; he complied.

Upon boarding, both passengers initially failed to adhere to the policy, with one passenger pulling down his mask after boarding and another passenger, Passenger X, similarly disregarding the requirement. Flight Attendant repeatedly requested both passengers to comply, and while they eventually raised their masks, they did so with resistance and defiance. Passenger X, in particular, responded confrontationally when reminded of the policy during snack service.

The face mask policy announcement has since been changed to reflect the face mask must be worn except while eating or drinking for a brief moment.In the future I will report on any employee if they are non-compliant since employees set the tone and pace on the flight. When employees don't comply with policy or procedures passengers think they can do the same and not comply. The Airline should not ask employees to follow policy and procedures and when customers send in bad letters make employees accountable.,,,,Flight attendant reported a deadheading Captain and a passenger were non-compliant with face mask policy.,"The incident arose from the non-compliance of a deadheading Captain and a passenger with the face mask policy on board Aircraft X. The Flight Attendant first requested the Captain to wear his mask, who complied. Subsequently, the Flight Attendant noticed a passenger in seat X4 and his wife not wearing masks while watching a movie. Despite the attendant's requests, the passenger refused compliance. Other passengers complained about this, prompting the attendant to make an announcement reiterating the mask policy. Following this, the policy was updated to specify that masks are required except when eating or drinking briefly. The Flight Attendant indicated a commitment to report future employee non-compliance, emphasizing that employee adherence sets the standard for passenger behavior. The attendant also suggested that the airline should ensure employees follow policies to prevent passenger non-compliance.

They said something to me about it after my break along the lines that she was upset and combative. I was surprised; as I wore my mask (a KN95 on the ground and a solid multi-layer cloth one in the air) all times outside of the flight deck and in the flight deck if a Flight Attendant was present.  Additionally; the other First Officer did as well. The Captain wears glasses that fog easily with a mask on. He wore a mask on the ground; he did not airborne because it would greatly interfere with his duties both because he wouldn't be able to see and could not communicate. This was our 4th leg together and we had no issues with masks among ourselves or other flight attendants.  Additionally; both the Captain and other First Officer already had COVID which they had gotten from people they knew at home; not in the workplace. Before our next rest room break I got out a new unused N95 mask for the Flight Attendant that would be in the flight deck while I was in the bathroom. When I called back and ask for the break she ordered me that the pilot remaining in the flight deck should wear the crew oxygen mask.  I said that was not something that we did anymore-the practice stopped months ago because of COVID.   I offered her the N95 for extra protection because the Captain can't wear a mask and do his job.  She refused it.  Instead continuing to wear what appeared to be a single layer stretchy black cloth mask. Additionally the flight attendant blocking the cart was wearing a KN95 but the Lead FA did not send her into the flight deck. I found the flight attendant to not be willing to exercise self-help and any wearing of an N95 and apparent multiple complaints to be a distraction from my flight duties. This was not good for crew CRM.

The Lead Flight Attendant offered an N95 mask as an extra precaution, given the Captain's difficulty in wearing a mask while fulfilling his duties. This offer was refused, with the flight attendant continuing to wear a single-layer cloth mask. This refusal led to the flight attendant's distress and complaints, which distracted from crew coordination and resulted in a reported issue with CRM (Crew Resource Management). The Lead Flight Attendant's attempt to mitigate the situation by providing additional protection was met with resistance, highlighting a compliance concern with the established mask policy.","mask policy, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

He further alleged that I knew about this prior to takeoff. I responded that I was not aware of any such issue; and would not have departed had I known. He said he had cell phone video and observed the aft FA (Flight Attendant) make a interphone call to the cockpit. Noting this was a serious safety issue. I concurred with him that if this occurred it was indeed a safety issue and that I would investigate and report as required; but I had not received an interphone call from the FA. He reiterated the cell phone video and stated his intent to submit it to [the company] and the FAA. He provided no further details; nor showed me the video; and departed. As background; the flight was operating about 5 hours late due to aircraft non-availability. Once we had an aircraft; we boarded and waited another 25 mins or so for a replacement FO (First Officer) as the original FO was now projected illegal. The new FO was a [distantly-based] new hire; but this had little if any impact on the flight. On taxi out we stopped for about 20 minutes in the west hard stand to receive a complete weather reroute from ATC; reentered the new route; got approval from dispatch to operate on the new route; changed runways and departures; briefed and accomplished flows and checklist. We had 4 minutes to make our [Departure Time]. I immediately made the 'FA prepare for Takeoff PA'; cleared to line up and wait by ATC; cycled the seat belt chime to alert FAs we were taking the runway; sat for 15-20 seconds and were cleared for takeoff. Uneventful flight to ZZZ till passenger approached me (FO was already gone) at gate in ZZZ. All of this delay information just indicates that passengers; especially a small child; might well have needed to use the lavatory. So I did query the Flt Attendants about this incident. The aft FA did make an interphone call to the #1 FA; following his chain of command; to advise that a father had taken his son into the restroom. The #1 FA told me he did not contact us on the Flt Deck because we had 'already started rolling for takeoff' and he was concerned about violating the sterile cockpit in a critical phase of flight. He made a quick decision that overall safety was better served by not contacting us. Clearly taking off with anyone in the lavatory is unsafe and against [company] SOPs. Unclear to me in this event is exactly when the father and child entered the lavatory. If during the hold short or line up and wait (15-20 secs) phase; a call could be appropriate to the cockpit to alert us of the situation. We could decline the takeoff clearance and clear the runway as needed. If in fact we were accelerating (rolling?) for takeoff; the passengers' safety may be more compromised by the rapid deceleration of a rejected takeoff. The FA's situational awareness is limited to our departure PA; and taking the runway chime followed by aircraft movement and engine noise. This limited input could affect their decision making process as to where we are in the takeoff maneuver.Secondly; I'm concerned about communication. I brief the #1 FA on every flight; I believe this to be important since we now fly with many different crews; from many different bases; frequently different on every leg. I did so on this flight to relay details of the flight and to open up communication. Still no one called to advise us of this event during the entire flight. I only learned about it from the concerned passenger at the arrival gate. Kind of blindsided. Not even the father in the lavatory said anything. Of note there were 10 uniformed crew members on the flight who said nothing when departing; though they may not have been in a position to observe anything. Bottom line is passenger safety is paramount; I believeunless we're on high speed takeoff roll; we could have handled a reject safely if notified. Perhaps a more assertive approach by the FA would have prevented this event from progressing to a takeoff with passengers not in their seats.,,,,A321 Captain reported being informed after landing of passenger using lavatory during previous takeoff roll.,"A passenger reported to the flight captain that a father and small boy were in the lavatory during takeoff. The passenger provided a cell phone video showing an interphone call made by a flight attendant to another crew member, who then did not contact the cockpit to avoid violating sterile cockpit rules during a critical phase. The flight experienced multiple delays, including aircraft unavailability and weather reroutes, leading to a near-miss of the departure time. The flight attendant involved made an interphone call but did not inform the cockpit, leaving the captain unaware of the situation until post-landing. The captain expressed safety concerns, emphasizing the importance of timely communication during takeoffs to allow for safe aborted takeoffs if necessary. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication protocols, especially with diverse crews, to prevent similar occurrences and ensure passenger safety.","safety related, communication issues, operational issues, crew-related issues, training, between attendant and crew"

This briefing; initiated since FA2 and FA3 are also do not feel safe; neither comfortable with FA4 since we were unclear that she is being lazy or do not know her duties.  I am attempted to set the tone for this flight.  FA4 has never performed a pre-flight check; but we did it.  I have asked FA4 to perform 15 mins walk-thru.  Later FA4 complains FA1 (myself) is too strict; she does not think she should take it seriously.  But FA2 advised her to take it seriously but do not take it personally.  Never closed overhead bin after I made an announcement of 'Boarding complete; flight attendant secure cabin for departure.'  Those attitudes become a burden on FA3 during boarding.  The situation was getting close to door closure; regarding exit row briefing; it must be conducted before door closure.  I had to call FA2 to do the exit row briefing and OHB closure to do boarding duties.  FA4 has not performed for compliance check during the flight when the seatbelt sign is illuminated but performed by us as an FA1; FA2; FA3.  FA4 does not answer customer call light even though I told her to get one of them.,,,,FA1 reported that FA4 could not perform duties without additional direction.,"The incident involved a conflict between two flight attendants (FA1 and FA4) during a pre-flight briefing and subsequent flight duties. FA1 conducted the briefing, which included reviewing in-flight procedures and addressing safety protocols. During the briefing, FA1 noticed that FA2 and FA3 were uncomfortable with FA4's performance, as her attitude and lack of initiative raised concerns about her ability to fulfill her duties without additional direction. FA1 attempted to set a professional tone for the flight but encountered resistance when FA4 failed to comply with directives, such as conducting a pre-flight check, closing overhead bins, and responding to customer call lights. FA1 reported that FA4's inability to perform her duties without direct supervision created a burden on the cabin crew, ultimately requiring other flight attendants to compensate for her lack of compliance. The situation was resolved when FA2 assumed additional responsibilities during boarding and the flight. No specific solution was proposed in the context provided.","crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

She said; 'I know this airplane.'  However; there are a few issues noted.  One; no pre-flight check has accomplished but sat down the last row and using a personal cellphone.  FAR 121.309 violation.  Remind herself to do it.  I checked instead.  Second; during all call; she did not know how to use the interphone. Had to ask FA2 to verify with FA4; the customer talked to me it was a concern if she knows what she is doing when I walked-thru the aisle during flight.  Third; when a customer had an issue with FA4 during boarding; FA4 told us the customer said to her 'Damn ass;' we solved a problem with MOD and the agent on the ground to make sure FA4 is ok.  However; after this event; FA4 was on her cellphone; texting on her jump seat while still boarding when I approached her.  Even though I told her not to do so but she continued.  Fourth; during the flight; no 15mins walk-thru; compliance checked when the seatbelt sign is illuminated; no response to customers call light. Those are accomplished but FA1; FA2; FA3 were the only crew have performed the in flight duty. Lastly; this is going to be other report that she was in sleep on the jump seat during the flight; complained about how tired she is.  Reported by FA2; FA3 was offering coffee or something to help; but she refused since she does not drink coffee.  Then shut the curtain.  The curtain opened by FA2 to accommodate other customers.  The last leg; I initiated crew briefing for the special information for our customers; flight-time; a reminder of pre-flight check emergency equipment check; in flight duties; compliance check; etc. FA4 has responded to FA2 FA1 is too strict.  When FA4 was based in New York; those never cared and she told FA2 that she does not need to take it seriously.  FA2; FA3 reported to me that this is not good.  We all do not feel safe to fly with her.  FA4 has also verbalized the eccentric phrase that she wants to create disease to kill people who ruin the environment.  I feel comfortable neither safe to work with this FA4.  FA2 and FA3 had the same sense as me.  I also advise my supervisor; as well.,,,,FA1 reported FA4 did not accomplish preflight checks IAW FAR's and was uncooperative during flight.,"The incident involved two flight attendants, Party1 (FA1) and Party2 (FA4), during a flight operation. FA1 reported several issues related to FA4's performance and behavior. These included non-compliance with pre-flight checks as per FAR 121.309, failure to use the interphone correctly, texting on her phone during boarding despite being instructed otherwise, and not responding to call lights during the flight. Additionally, FA4 was observed sleeping on her jump seat and expressed hostile remarks. FA1, along with FA2 and FA3, felt unsafe working with FA4 and reported their concerns to management. The result was a formal report filed by FA1 detailing the violations and uncooperative behavior of FA4.","safety related, operational issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"
1667046,Aircraft X,General Seating Area,,Flight Attendant In Charge,,,Safety Related Duties,Communication Breakdown,Party1 Flight Attendant; Party2 Flight Crew,1667046,,,,,,,,,,,,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Illness / Injury,,Y,Person Flight Attendant,In-flight,General Maintenance Action,Human Factors,Human Factors,It was brought to my attention by the other Flight Attendant  that an older woman; who had pre-boarded informed her that her seat would needed to be wiped down with Clorox after she deplaned. After speaking with the PAX (Passenger) she informed me that she had a highly contagious disease. After speaking with her; She explained that her illness wasn't airborne but someone could contract it if they touched anything she'd touched. I asked her for her name. Although; it was turbulent and we were on final descent; I contacted the cockpit they were informed of what was going on. I was told he couldn't talk at that time but did I need me Paramedics to meet us at the gate. I asked him to have a Supervisor meet the plane. The PAX was not in distress and showed no signs of needing immediate medical attention; therefore I didn't call for medical assistance. Once at the gate pure chaos erupted. Ops quickly opened the door allowed me to get off the plane then close and locked the jet bridge door which prohibited anyone from deplaning. I was trying to explain what was going on; meanwhile the Captain was trying to get into the jet bridge. I had to open the the door for him. Then I was told to make an announcement telling the PAX not to deplane. I checked on the UM (Unaccompanied Minor) and make sure he understood that he was okay. There were several Supervisors present. I was simultaneously speaking to them and Inflight. We had to wait for clearance to allow PAX off the plane. Together with Ops and Supervisors gathered all the facts so that they could inform the UM's parent's of the possible exposure. I was trying to keep the PAX that was in that same row with the ill PAX and the UM from deplaning as requested by the Supervisors. Pax were cleared to deplane; Supervisor took care of the UM and the PAX in that row deplaned with me getting her information. After everyone deplaned; I helped the ill PAX off the aircraft. I returned to the plane and cleaned the row with our onboard disinfectant. After that; I was talking to the Inflight SUP; trying to help a crew change; speaking with the Captain; updating my crew; and telling the outbound crew they could come down the jet way and board the aircraft. I did not get all the ill PAX information to put in my IR.Once we landed the pilots could have called us back and clarify what was going on. I feel if that would have happened; ground ops would not have went into lock down. Collectively we could have came up with a plan. Everyone plays a vital role but sometimes if we are not flying the plane we are made to feel less than for lack of a better word. I could only communicate the information I was given . We were in final descent but once we landed I did not feel comfortable contacting the cockpit. Once we landed the Captain never tried to contact us to clarify what was going on; which created a problem once we got to the gate and he was locked in. It was only at that time that he wanted know what was going on.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant in Charge reported a communications breakdown between Flight Attendant and flight crew shortly after being notified of a passenger with a 'highly contagious disease'.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between a flight attendant and the flight crew of a B737 aircraft, triggered by the presence of a passenger with a highly contagious disease. The flight attendant was informed by another crew member about the passenger, who had pre-boarded and requested that her seat be cleaned with Clorox after deplaning. Upon speaking with the passenger, the flight attendant learned that the individual had a contagious illness, which could be transmitted through contact but was not airborne. Despite the turbulence and being on final descent, the flight attendant contacted the cockpit, informing them of the situation. The cockpit, occupied by the captain, was unable to communicate at that time but was advised to have a supervisor meet the plane at the gate. The passenger was not in distress and did not require immediate medical attention, so the flight attendant did not call for emergency services. Upon landing, chaos erupted at the gate. Operations staff opened the door, allowing the flight attendant to deplane, but then locked the jet bridge, preventing other passengers from exiting. The captain attempted to enter the jet bridge, and the flight attendant was forced to open the door for him. The flight attendant was instructed to make an announcement asking passengers to remain on the plane, while supervisors gathered to collect information and inform the parents of an unaccompanied minor (UM) about potential exposure. The flight attendant worked to prevent the UM and other passengers in the affected row from deplaning, as requested by supervisors. Once cleared, passengers, including the UM, were allowed to exit, with the flight attendant collecting the ill passenger's information. After everyone had deplaned, the flight attendant assisted the ill passenger off the aircraft, cleaned the affected row with onboard disinfectant, and continued her duties, including coordinating with the inflight supervisor, the captain, and the outbound crew. The incident highlighted a breakdown in communication post-landing, as the captain did not contact the cabin crew to clarify the situation, leading to confusion and the subsequent lockdown. The flight attendant expressed frustration with the lack of communication and the resulting delays, suggesting that a coordinated approach could have been achieved if the captain had communicated with the cabin crew after landing. The proposed solution was for the captain to contact the cabin crew post-landing to avoid the lockdown and develop a unified plan. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of clear communication and collaboration among all crew members, regardless of their role.","crew-related issues, health and medical issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

The Captain was already there; we said hello; [and] I did my walk around then started my preflight duties. As we were boarding; we were having the standard (where are you from) conversation. Captain told me he lives out of base and is relatively new to ZZZ. He then said he was actually thinking about changing bases soon because he can't take the attitudes of ZZZ First Officer's. Personally; I have been a ZZZ First Officer for 5 years and have never heard of a problem. Being concerned; I asked what's been going on. He never really gave me an example; but he basically said that these First Officers have a problem with challenging the Captain. Then he said that he is sure that we won't have that issue on this trip because I don't seem like that type of guy. Then he continued and told me that if I do want to play the game of who knows more; that he promises that it won't end well for me. I assured him that I don't play those games and I only speak up if it's a safety issue or I feel it necessary. And that was about the extent of my briefing from the Captain. I thought it was odd that at this day and age; my briefing was basically 'don't challenge the Captain'. I then told him that he can't hurt my feelings and to please speak up if he sees me making a mistake.At this time; Maintenance comes into the flight deck to tell us a tire that was questionable was well within their limits and that we were good to go. Maintenance questioned what guidance we had and we explained our guidance is much different than theirs; usually more conservative. I gave the mechanic the example of the hydraulic fluid quantities and their 'normal fill' range. The book states if it is at all outside of those limits; even for thermal expansion; that we are required to call Maintenance. The Captain then spoke up and said that wasn't true as they've added a note saying that as long as we don't have any ECAMs that we don't have to call Maintenance. I was surprised he said that and asked when it changed. He said it changed a long time ago; probably 6 months ago. I said that I must have missed the change and we moved on. During the taxi; we had a crosswind that was technically a 1 knot tailwind. I said ok no problem; TOGA take off and I'll go to the TPS and work the number. Captain told me not to use the TPS but to just request a new TPS using 'request T.O. Data' and put the tailwind in there. I said that doesn't work. You can compute the tailwind penalty manually or call and have a new TPS sent with the tailwind penalty added. He said 'oh really; well you're the only First Officer that seems to think that'. He then continued and told me that about 30 of his last First Officer's requested a new TPS with the tailwind. I said that I found that odd because they make it every clear in training that you cannot do this. I asked if I could just do this manually for now and we could talk about the tailwind and the TPS during our flight to ZZZ1. He agreed. As I was heads down doing the penalty; the Captain was swerving down the taxiway because he was also heads down doing the same thing. I said I'll take care of this so you can taxi. He said no it's ok; I'm good at taxiing. So a short time later; I said ok we have a TOGA take off and our penalty is 970 LBS. off MTOW. He said; not its 1;050 [LBS]. I said ok maybe I looked at it wrong. I looked again and it was in fact 970 lbs. He looked again and agreed as he saw his mistake. We were legal to take off. Once we were on our way and not busy with ZZZ; I looked up the note about the normal fill for the hydraulics. I read the note and it still says we are required to call Maintenance. I showed the Captain. He read it and was surprised that it said what it said and that he must have missed the last sentence. We moved on and I said let's look at the TPS. I said that; like the hydraulic issue; I'm looking this up for my own personal knowledge. Things change all the time and who knows; maybe [Company] pushed the button that allows us to grab a new TPS with a tailwind. So I said I'll request a new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind and see what it says. He said; we are in flight; you can't request a new TPS because we are in flight. I said sure you can and pushed the button and spit it out. I showed him the new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind compared to our original TPS and both were identical. The Captain was in the TPS flow chart in the QRH and was in disbelief that it didn't say that you could request a new TPS with a tailwind. He then said 'damn it if I'm going to lose a beer over this'. At this point; I stopped him and said the he wasn't going to lose a beer because we aren't playing a game of who knows what. There have been a ton of changes and if something as important as when to call Maintenance or how to know if we're legal for takeoff; I want to know. That was it. At this point I realized that tension was building. The Captain was irritated that I was challenging him. I decided at this point that I wasn't going to speak up unless I absolutely had to. Now one thing I didn't mention was that the Captain briefed the flight attendants to stay seated for 1 hr and 30 minutes after takeoff as a precaution because of what was left of the hurricane. We were routed around to the north of it but he still kept them down. I thought that was excessive. The ride was smooth. I didn't say anything. Nor did I say a thing when we had to deviate around cells. He would do an all call and tell everyone to take their seats. We were deviating a long way around these cells and I had absolutely no doubt that it would be a smooth ride. We even had reports from other aircraft that the ride was smooth. The other thing I felt was odd; was that less than one minute after he called the flight attendants; he was surprised that they were still dealing with their carts and not already in their seats. I honestly don't think he has any idea what the flight attendants have to do to clean up and sit down. The flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 was mostly smooth. We have specific guidance in regards to the ride quality when it comes to flight attendants and passengers.Either way we had an uneventful flight to ZZZ1 and we had good conversation. The next morning we were getting ready for our leg back to ZZZ. We were ready for departure but I believe we had to wait for traffic behind us. The Captain put the delay for pay purposes into ACARS. I was just making small talk and said I heard there was a potentially easier way of doing it that might save him time. This set him off. The Captain kept saying; almost yelling 'it's amazing when you upgrade everyone tries to prove you wrong. Just you wait; it's amazing. Everyone just tries to prove you wrong.' This little rant went on for an uncomfortable amount of time. I finally stopped him and said that is absolutely not what I'm trying to do and that I'm sorry that I somehow came off that way. I said that there have been so many big changes that it's very difficult to keep up and so easy to miss. I told him how just last month I was told that I was doing a checklist incorrectly. We looked it up and sure enough they were correct. I told him there were no hard feelings and I was glad it was brought to my attention. That was the end of that conversation.  I want to be clear the reason I wrote such detail about the events leading up to the diversion is because I think it's important and can better understand how we ended up in ZZZ2. It's my leg to ZZZ from ZZZ1. We are in a full 320. We have been airborne for less than 20 minutes. The Captain is eating his kung pow kitty as the Flight Attendant calls. She said she turned the oven on and about 1 minute later smoke started coming out. Captain asked if she turned it off and she said she did. He instructed her not to open the oven and that we are diverting. He hangs up with her; looks at me and said smoke in the cabin; we're going down now! Before I could say a word he grabs the mic and [advises ATC] and said we needed to get on the ground immediately. He then dons his O2 mask even though there wasn't even a hint of smoke or even a smell in the flight deck. Because his was on; I grabbed mine. After about 2 minutes; the Captain realized he couldn't communicate very well and he takes it off; as do I. Now I can't remember if we knew on initial contact that the oven was no longer smoking or if it was just a few minutes later. Either way; the Captain and I knew that there were dinner rolls in the oven; it started smoking 1 minute after she turned it on and that it stopped smoking as soon as she turned the oven off.I could not believe we were diverting....for toast. The Captain was busy running the smoke in the cabin checklist and I was flying the plane and talking to ATC. I strongly considered talking to the Captain and asking if we should possibly reconsider the diversion since it doesn't seem to be a safety of flight issue. Considering the way he has responded to any type of questioning; and the fact that he was currently deep in the yellow and headed for the red; if I questioned his judgement; it would have put him through the roof and that would have been very unsafe in any phase of flight; especially a diversion. I decided the safest course was to just go along with his diversion and not question him. During the diversion; he must have fired off a text to Dispatch saying we needed to divert. I don't know what his message said. Initially I suggested we turn back towards ZZZ1. So we did. I then realized we were far too heavy for the short runway. I pulled up ZZZ3 and it was too far for the Captain. At this time Dispatch responds and said to divert to ZZZ2. I plug it in and it was 40 miles to the East. I said Dispatch said to go to ZZZ2. He said that's where he wants to go also. I told ATC and we started to head that way. I slowed the plane down to give us time; changed destination and set up for the ILS. I did the landing distance for our weight and it said around 8;000 feet; we had 13;200 feet. I briefed the Captain and told him I was doing flaps full with manual auto brakes. Since we had such a long runway I was going to stay off the brakes until under 100 kts to keep them from getting too hot. I told him I already spoke with ATC and said we'd either make a right turn off or back taxi. He cut me off and said we were going to be stopping on the runway and having the trucks look us over with their equipment and look for any hot spots and to also check our brake temps. I had a nice touchdown and used the brakes as I briefed. We came to a stop and watched the trucks surround us. As we sit there we put the brake fans on; the temps never got over 220. Minutes go by and I said I'll use this time to call Tower and ask exactly where we are parking. I got snapped at by the Captain once again. He said I needed to calm down and to stop interfering with their emergency procedures. A short time later; Tower called us asking if we were ready to taxi yet. Captain responded that after the fire trucks have looked us over and checked our brake temps that we'd then be able to taxi. Tower said he were completely fine. Again; our brake temps were never above 220. Captain tells Tower we are ready to taxi and we do. There were ramp personnel waiting for us and they parked us on the ramp just before where they park the RJ's so we don't block them. Air stairs are brought to our plane and the fire fighters confirm there is no fire and they leave. At this point we haven't deplaned. Captain looked to me and said he said he was done flying and that it would be unsafe for us to continue due to the nature of the high stress emergency. I said that I think we should consider just getting fuel and continuing. Of course we needed an overweight inspection. He said we were done. So now we needed to get the passengers to the terminal. The Captain deemed it unsa,,,,A320 First Officer reported less than optimal CRM combined with smoke in the cabin caused by dinner rolls in the oven; which ultimately led to a diversion.,"The incident began with a briefing where the Captain expressed concerns about past First Officers challenging his authority, which the First Officer found unusual. Disagreements arose regarding procedures, such as requesting a new TPS in flight, leading to growing tension. During the return leg, smoke from the oven, caused by burning dinner rolls, prompted the Captain to divert to ZZZ2. Despite the First Officer's consideration of continuing, the Captain, under stress, opted for an overweight inspection and refused to proceed further. This resulted in a delay, with passengers disembarking and the aircraft being parked for the night.","crew-related issues, fume/smoke incident, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

One; if the crew never left the gate when they encountered a power distribution irregularity when switching from ground to APU power. Two; if Line Control had a Jetway Operator standing by at the gate. And three; if there was a better and clearer communication between the maintenance crew.I received a gate call on the radio; that Aircraft X was coming back to the gate; due to a 'Warn Elec' message on EICAS. I was informed by Line Control that Aircraft X was returning to the gate and was asked if I needed the jetway to be pulled up. I replied 'Yes I will need the jetway pulled up'. Myself and two mechanics that were assigned to Aircraft X; headed out to the gate. As we approached the gate; the ground crew were getting ready to greet the aircraft; no Jetway Operator. At this time I made a second request to Line Control; for a Jetway Operator. The aircraft arrives; the ground crew guide the plane in. One Mechanic jumps on the headset; the other climbs in to the E compartment to reset circuit breakers.I was thumbing through the iPad; looking for possible causes in the AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) and FIM (Fault Isolation Manual) procedures. Maintenance was ready to go. Still no Jetway. At this time I decided not to wait any longer and go through the hatch of the plane and get onboard. I pointed upstairs to the Mechanic on the headset. I got his attention a second time and mouthed 'upstairs' and pointed upwards again. He nodded. As I am climbing in the E compartment; I got the other Mechanic's attention. He had told me that he reset circuit breakers and that I should see if the message cleared. I agreed.I banged on the hatch before opening it; then proceeded to crack it open. I saw light; looked clear to open. Heard a yell; then a foot come through; hitting me on the head; face; then right shoulder. I reacted by catching a foot with a black shoe and proceeded to hoist the foot to safety; by placing it in the galley on solid ground. I got out and I saw an elderly gentleman; a Flight Attendant; sobbing from pain sitting down. At this point I headed into the cockpit and I started pushing buttons to clear the message. No help. The First Officer and the Observer were explaining the problem they encountered before leaving the gate initially. The Captain was more concerned with the Flight Attendant; than getting this plane out. He took his time and explained to the passengers in great detail of the happenings that occurred. He should have just assured the passengers that matters would be solved quickly and swiftly; instead of shining the light on us maintenance. He was very rude and never once did anyone ask me if I was okay.Now; people are starting to show up. Port Authority police; some safety members from our maintenance department; one other mechanic. Through this bad ordeal; I am disappointed as to treatment that I was subjected to by the Port Authority police; the Captain and one female flight attendant; who felt that her opinion mattered more than the professionalism required to maintain in front of our customers. It never ceases to amaze me on how insignificant we as mechanics are made to feel by other departments here at [Company]. I thought we were all on the same team!,,,,Mechanic reported that a Flight Attendant was injured when he accidentally stepped through an open floor hatch.,"The incident occurred when a maintenance crew responded to a 'Warn Elec' message on an aircraft, leading them to attempt resetting circuit breakers. Due to a delay in obtaining a jetway operator, the maintenance team proceeded without one, resulting in a mechanic entering the aircraft through an open hatch. During this process, a flight attendant accidentally stepped through the hatch, causing injuries to both the flight attendant and the mechanic. The Captain's management of the situation and subsequent interaction with the maintenance crew were perceived as disrespectful, highlighting a need for improved interdepartmental communication and support systems. Proposed solutions include ensuring a jetway operator is available and enhancing communication protocols to prevent such incidents. The outcome underscores the importance of teamwork and respect in addressing technical issues efficiently.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

I walked out and a mother said her toddler had to use the restroom and couldn't wait. I told the woman that I needed to contact the Captain and see if it was possible to let her use the facility before departure. I walked back to the aft inter phone and called the cockpit. The Captain said we would pull off to the side and she would have about 2-3 minutes to use the lavatory. I walked back out into the cabin and relayed the information to her and said to wait until the plane stopped and to make it as quick as possible. The aircraft turned and when we stopped the woman handed the toddler to her husband and they headed to the back lavatory. As the father and toddler entered the lavatory there was a single high-low chime. I headed back to the aft inter phone as the [Flight Attendant] A cleared us for departure. I called the Captain to remind him that we had a passenger and toddler in the lavatory and he responded 'we are going; tell them to hang on'. I knocked on the lavatory door and told the passengers to hang on; that we were taking off and to please stay in there until I said it was safe to come out (keep in mind that there were no empty seats towards the back and they were about 15 rows from their seat). It is very bumpy for the first 5-10 minutes in LAS this time of year and I didn't want them up for initial ascent either. We took off and around the 10;000 ft. ding I escorted the gentleman and toddler back to their seats. The Captain called back via the inter phone and apologized and said something to the effect of 'we were supposed to be second for departure but they moved us up'.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that Captain elected to take off with a gentleman and toddler in the lavatory.,"The incident occurred during a flight's initial stages at LAS airport, where a mother requested her toddler use the restroom before departure. The flight attendant informed the Captain, who agreed to allow the passenger to use the lavatory, giving them approximately 2-3 minutes. After the passengers entered the lavatory, the Captain decided to expedite departure, despite the flight attendant's reminder that the passengers were still inside. The aircraft took off, and around 10,000 feet, the flight attendant escorted the gentleman and toddler back to their seats.

I agreed to tag team and verify she had ended her call. I walked by and she hid her phone down by her side; so I couldn't tell one way or another. I told the other FA I would check during final compliance. After our safety demo; I walked by and she was very clearly texting. I asked her to put her phone into airplane mode. I didn't want to appear that I was singling her out and hovering; so I walked away and checked on my way back up front. Again; she was very engrossed in her texting. She was sending and receiving messages and there was no airplane mode icon on her phone. It showed she had service. Again; I told her that her phone needed to be in airplane mode. I told her that we needed her to comply and put her phone in airplane mode now. She looked up at me; visibly annoyed; turned her phone away and said 'Yeah.' When I was standing there; she made no attempt to turn her phone into airplane mode. I didn't have a visual of the phone anymore but to my knowledge; she never did. Enroute; we caught a couple glances of her cell phone; every time it was not in airplane mode. It wasn't as if she was unaware; she actively chose not to comply.This passenger was a [premium frequent flyer]. Normally; passengers that are that non-compliant are asked to comply or to be removed from flight; however; neither one of us FAs felt the company would support removing a [premium member] over a compliance issue. We also feared we would have gotten in trouble if we had tried. I struggled with it because this passenger was purposely not complying and in an emergency; I don't know that I could count on her to follow crew member instructions.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being unwilling to report passenger misconduct due to the possibility of company retribution.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and a premium frequent flyer passenger. The flight attendant requested the passenger to end her phone call and switch to airplane mode as the cabin door was closing. Despite repeated requests, the passenger ignored the instructions and continued using her phone, which remained connected to service. The flight attendant hesitated to enforce compliance due to concerns about company retribution and potential trouble for removing a premium member. As a result, the passenger's non-compliance persisted throughout the flight, leaving the flight attendant uncertain about the passenger's reliability in an emergency.","safety related, crew-related issues, between attendant and passengers"

As soon as she saw I passed she flipped her phone face down on her tray table. I made an announcement to please make sure electronic devices are in game/airplane mode.This passenger is a [premium frequent flyer.] I feel if we would of returned back to the gate or had authorities meet the plane the company would not have had our back and would have reprimanded myself and my other flight attendant. However; she was not compliant. It wasn't that she just didn't know any better. She is a [frequent flyer] which is a hard status to achieve and she was purposely not complying and having a smug attitude.,,,,Flight Attendant reported passenger using electronic device in prohibited mode.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant noticed a premium frequent flyer using her electronic device in prohibited mode during the flight. The attendant made several requests for the passenger to switch her device to airplane mode, but the passenger appeared non-compliant and displayed a smug attitude. The flight attendant felt the company might not support her if she reported the incident, leading her to decide against pursuing further action. The passenger's behavior ultimately went unaddressed.","between attendant and passengers, safety related, crew-related issues, disruptive"

Saturdays are busier than normal but no effort to adjust that today.  Then management assigns domestic on what they thought was an open desk [XX] but that desk was open and they make that domestic dispatcher who showed at XA00 to move off the desk they assigned in error to desk [XX] one and half hours after being here; in that time of moving desk to desk [YY] they received several calls (please note that releases have that desk number on it) so the one remaining international desk [ZZ] has to now answer and transfer the calls to correct desk; while working their new workload which is in beginning of shift and they are also working to remain in control of desk. The Domestic Dispatcher is now rushing to move and reset up and transfer flights between desks; and of course there are several calls and now all desks in international which where reduced by two are forced to help the lone domestic dispatcher with these issues; in addition.  Now that this Dispatcher moved all but one flight was moved that was caught by incoming Dispatcher and moved to the original desk that had it on the domestic side since new Dispatcher was also on a call and still trying to set up their new desk.  The phones kept ringing on wrong desk and the lone Domestic Dispatcher asked for help not knowing that two of the International Dispatchers where already on phone with the Domestic Dispatchers other issues.  I asked the International Dispatcher next to me to get the Chief to lend assistance but they where in the bridge morning meeting discussing the weather and daily assignments.  The International Dispatcher came back to report that Chief was unavailable; and I suggested that the Chief needs to leave that meeting and help domestic dispatcher for they are swamped and bringing down the entire Caribbean team; so the other dispatcher went to Chief and insisted on getting help for domestic dispatch and fortunately there was a Chief in training who came down to answer phones and lend a hand.  The phone calls I took where Flight ABCD time off gate was generated in error and needed to be removed; Flight DAEE was in ZZZ going to ZZZ1 and they where given a ground delay and ATC re-route so then I had to get reroute ensure compliance build that route and verify that we had petrol to accomplish this: I got so in detailed with this issues I did not get time out and I had to ask International Dispatcher to remove that time.  While working on weather briefing and re-route another of the Domestic lines where ringing and all International Dispatchers where on phone so I grabbed the call and placed them on hold to finish re-route but that person hung up and then called.  I advised the captain of Flight DAEE that I would finish re-route after I briefed on weather and send them an ACARS with route and burns; since the Domestic Dispatcher was at this point under water and not coming up.  The Captain said that would be fine and I built his new route while I answered another one of the Domestic Dispatchers phone lines.  This was a flight attendant who once I answered she said they had a medical emergency and needed Medlink!  I asked for flight number while I was still engaged in the re-route for the Domestic Dispatch (placing all my international desk and its duties on lower priority).  The Flight Attendant (FA) was not using proper radio telephone procedure; nor had any patience; to connect to Medlink we need basic info flight number; age; gender; problem or issue but the FA when placed on hold thought they where disconnected and called back but to further aspirate the issue they called the original desk domestic side of room and needed to be transferred to international side of room.  So this one flight and one flight attendant had to be spoken to sternly just to remain on line with Medlink.  Now once Medlink got on lineagain the FA did not provide information had to be extracted by Medlink and that conversation was very difficult because the FA world speak pause and speak not allowing Medlink to speak or speaking over Medlink with the constant live mic one of the mics stuck open and there was a constant hiss in back ground and flight attendant kept telling doctor to speak louder and the doctor was practically yelling; finally the FA said that they could not hear so I ACARS crew to have PIC call in and speak to Medlink; since the doctor on board was saying they needed to land now; the Domestic Dispatcher got that call and remained on line with the Medlink and did divert the flight but this poor planning of management and multiple error caused problems for a international section that was already task saturated due to managements closing of several desk and distributing that international workload.Several failures:  First Management not understanding that it is not the number of flights but the quality of work and the management team has closed desk that was originally planned open based on published schedule.  Second; Management not familiar with work on quad and placed a Domestic Dispatcher on a weekend International desk; third; the decision to move was not well thought or executed and if it was not for another dispatcher an airborne flight would have been left unattended; Forth; placing a domestic dispatcher in an area by themselves with no support of other domestic dispatchers working similar area and familiar with weather; GDP; and ATC initiatives; fifth; only having one chief who was also task saturated; sixth; not having properly training flight attendants on proper radio telephone etiquette and protocol. Stop closing desk; and Staff properly (follow workload committee models numbers and not a number that is not truly representative of the actual work.  Have sector managers that come from ranks of dispatch and fully understand issues on floor or at least have them trained by dispatch instructors who have worked the floor.  Place like dispatchers together i.e. domestic working NE or ZZZ1 or SE together so highest quality of information is properly disseminated to flight crews without taking extra time and further task saturating the other dispatchers and areas.  Have an International Chief and Domestic Chief (or at least two Chiefs; who are current and qualified to better aid floor dispatchers).  Properly train all flight attendants for proper radio telephone etiquette and protocol.,,,,Dispatcher reported staffing issues resulting in being inundated with various tasks and moving from the desk to desk in order try to maintain operational control and communications with their flights.,"The incident arose from a combination of poor management decisions and miscommunication within the dispatch team, leading to a highly task-saturated workload and operational breakdown. The root cause included the reduction of international desks without adjusting the workload, assigning a domestic dispatcher to an international desk during peak hours, and insufficient staffing planning. These decisions overwhelmed the remaining dispatchers, who were forced to handle an influx of calls and re-routing of flights while managing their own workload. Additionally, a flight attendant's lack of proper radio telephone protocol compounded the issue during a medical emergency, requiring the intervention of a Chief in training to assist the overwhelmed domestic dispatcher. The result was a near-disruption of operations, with the flight being diverted due to the poor planning and lack of support. The dispatcher highlighted several systemic failures, including inadequate staffing models, lack of trained leadership, and insufficient training for flight attendants. Proposed solutions included restoring proper staffing levels, having dedicated international and domestic chiefs, and improving training for both dispatchers and flight attendants to prevent similar incidents.","safety related, operational issues, crew-related issues, communication issues, training, between attendant and crew"

I did hear a chime go off. I never heard 'flight attendants prepare for departure' myself; the number one and a cabin jumpseat rider were all standing up when the plane started taking off. The carts were not secure! All 3 of us stood during takeoff. The number one and myself had to hold on to carts so they wouldn't roll. Bottom line is the Captain never said 'prepare for departure.'Captain must say prepare for departure...if he doesn't we might think that chime was just a call light or something of that nature.,,,,Flight attendant reported that the Captain did not notify the cabin crew before takeoff; resulting in a departure with flight attendants standing in the galley.,"The incident was triggered by the Captain's failure to issue the standard ""prepare for departure"" command before takeoff. Upon hearing a chime, the flight crew, including the flight attendant, assumed it might be a routine call light. Without the Captain's command, they stood in the galley during takeoff. The carts were not secured, requiring the crew to hold them in place to prevent movement. This situation posed a safety risk, as the crew was not properly positioned for takeoff, potentially hindering their ability to respond to emergencies. To prevent recurrence, it was emphasized that the Captain must consistently issue the ""prepare for departure"" command to ensure clarity and safety for the cabin crew.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

The agent informed us at the gate that they were holding the flight for incoming crew. We went ahead and boarded and shortly after the agent stated they were boarding anyway. After boarding was complete; the gent came on and said we were going on the trip since the other crew was not there and that crew scheduling would call. I updated my flight and looked at crew portal where I saw that I had been placed on a trip to ZZZ1 that was supposed to leave a bit later. The door was shut and taxiout started. I started the safety video and my phone rang from crew scheduling. I answered the call; thinking that I needed to; since there was confusion about the working crew and the ZZZ trip listed. Crew scheduling told me to go directly to the gate for the ZZZ trip and I informed them our pre-board had been told by the agent we were going. They told me they had no idea that we were taking the ZZZ1 trip. After hanging up; the video was still playing for safety and I knew that I probably should not have answered the phone.I know not to answer my phone on board the aircraft.,,,,Flight attendant reported answering a phone call from crew scheduling during taxi; resulting in a policy violation.,"The incident occurred due to confusion regarding crew assignments. A flight attendant was called to assist with pre-boarding a flight to ZZZ and was informed by the gate agent that they would board as the incoming crew was delayed. After boarding, the pilot announced they were departing, and the attendant noticed a discrepancy in their assigned trip on the crew portal. During taxi, the attendant's phone rang from crew scheduling, prompting them to answer despite knowing they shouldn't use their phone on the aircraft. This led to a policy violation. The result was a reprimand for the flight attendant, who received additional training on communication protocols. This incident highlights the importance of adhering to established procedures, particularly regarding electronic device usage during critical flight phases.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, training, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

Flight Attendant A was in boarding position during boarding; but may have been temporarily distracted by a request from the flight deck when the [passenger of small stature] boarded. Flight Attendant C had not asked for assistance or confirmation regarding the suitability of the [passenger of small stature] for overwing exit row seating. When Flight Attendant A returned to the forward jumpseat; she asked Flight Attendant C about the passenger and whether she thought the passenger met the requirements. Flight Attendant A had noticed that the [passenger's] feet were sticking out just beyond the seat. Flight Attendant C assured Flight Attendant A that she had asked this passenger if she could perform the duties and had been answered in the affirmative.The passenger was seated and the plane was moving when Flight Attendant A first saw her. Flight Attendant A could not estimate the passenger's height or mobility at this time.Since evacuations are such a rare event; flight attendants frequently do not want to risk a passenger confrontation or worse; a claim of discrimination by someone in a protected group. However; a person claiming to have a disability may not be likely to meet the requirements; and be disqualified from overwing exit row seating.The Safety Information Card states that a person who sits in the exit row must have sufficient strength and dexterity to toss objects the size of the exit row window (approximately 50 lbs.) over seats. Of course; in the past; we actually had to remove the window. While it is no longer necessary to pull the window out and toss it over seats; it is likely that in an emergency an ABA [Able Bodied Assistant] at the overwing exit might have to wrestle luggage away from exiting passengers and toss it over seats. An ABA would also be expected to be able to assist other passengers.When the [passenger] exited the aircraft; Flight Attendant A noticed that she was approximately as tall as the G7 counter; about 42 inches. She was not especially stout; and probably weighed 80-90 lbs. Considering that she was only 3.5 feet tall; it is unlikely that she had the strength or stature to toss heavy objects over seats; or even lift something that weighed more than half her weight; or manipulate something the size of an overwing exit window. The proportionally shorter arms and legs of [small stature passengers] impact mobility.Flight Attendants are deathly afraid to be charged with discriminating or have a scene that could result in negative media. Additionally; the Flight Attendant runs the risk of not being backed up by the Customer Service Representative if they call for assistance.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger of small stature sat in the exit row and caused doubt as to whether she would be capable of assisting in an emergency.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant (Party1) who noticed a passenger of small stature seated in the overwing exit row. During boarding, the Flight Attendant was distracted and did not immediately assess the passenger's ability to assist in an emergency. Another Flight Attendant confirmed the passenger's capability without further evaluation. Post-departure, the Flight Attendant questioned the passenger's height and mobility, noting she was approximately 42 inches tall and weighed 80-90 lbs., making it unlikely she could perform necessary tasks. The concern arose due to the risk of discrimination claims and negative media, which deters Flight Attendants from challenging such situations. The result highlighted the need for a proposed solution: evaluating passengers' abilities before assigning exit row seating.","crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and passengers"

It became apparent that while we thought he was sleeping with the blanket covering his head he had indeed been puffing his cigarette. (A-FA) then realized when she thought she had smelled a faint cigarette odor in FC (First Class) but found no smoke or anything in the lav she chalked it up to being on someone's clothes. These types of cigarettes are a newer items that are smokeless and quite odorless as well. He was standing outside baggage claim as we were walking to our crew van so (C-FA) and myself politely went up to him and mentioned that we had found his smokeless cigarettes around his seat. Our intention was to politely tell him that it was a fine-able offense and so for future flying he'd have been warned. However before we finished speaking he started berating us and our airline; using explicit language and saying we are the worst airline he's ever experienced and that the cigarettes had fallen out of his pocket. He said that he had already tweeted a negative review and was awaiting [TV New Channel] response and to get the '[Expletive deleted]' which (C-FA) and I remained calm and polite and walked away knowing anything else we might say would fall on deaf ears. During our agricultural form pass-out of the flight we had limited quantities so I allowed a few traveling families to include their elderly grandparents on their forms so that we had enough. (Literally we were short only 2 forms on walk through). [Passenger] said he heard that and was notifying [State] Agriculture that we allowed them to lie on their forms. However we had a few families take extra forms and then delivered those to previously stated families to fill out for the grandparents so his allegations were obviously not true. He was a very rude passenger and escalated any event on this flight to create a very hostile work environment. Earlier submitted report:We had a very disgruntled first time [Airline] flyer occupying seat XX.His first grievance was that we could not serve him a double bourbon upon boarding and then became pissed when he realized we served our pre-departure beverages in plastic glasses and refused his sparkling white wine when it was handed to him. His companion then requested a pillow which I told them we did not have and his response was 'Do you guys have [expletive deleted] anything'; I apologized and walked away. During the flight while I was guarding for a Pilot break he tried to stand and come forward; I politely explained I needed everyone to remain seated as the pilots were utilizing the lav. He began to complain once seated again that this was '[expletive deleted] unnecessary and he's never seen it before'...he then got impatient and got up to attempt going to the aft and rudely made his way past our C doing a water service cussing under his breath. While there was no personal damage done; his choice of foul language and bad attitude is worth mentioning seeing as our normally favored [Airline] service was not enjoyed by him and he may write one healthy complaint.[Passenger] should not be allowed to fly our airline and should be fined for his obvious rule breaking behavior. He was defiant and apparently has trouble understanding our responsibilities as a crew.,,Mid flight I noticed I smelled cigarettes around row X; and after looking could not locate the origin of the smell; and saw no smoke. At this point I figured someone had smoked before we left and had shifted positions and the smell was suddenly released from their clothing.

(Flight Attendant D) and (Flight Attendant B) informed him as they passed on the way to the shuttle that that kind of behavior is a fine able offense.Crew to be made aware of the situation on his original flight. Agents should inform him before he boards that this kind of behavior is illegal and flight attendants can and will in force FAA rules.,,Flight attendants reported finding smokeless cigarette butts and confronting passenger in baggage area.,"The incident involved a passenger (Party2) and a flight attendant (Party1) aboard a flight. The flight attendant discovered three smokeless cigarette butts in the first-class cabin near the passenger's seat. Despite the passenger appearing to sleep with a blanket over his head, the flight attendant noticed the butts and an odor she initially dismissed as clothing scent. Upon deplaning, the flight attendant and a colleague confronted the passenger about the butts, explaining it was a fineable offense. The passenger responded with explicit language, blaming the butts on his pocket and claiming he had already filed a negative review. During the flight, the passenger was confrontational, complaining about alcohol service and using offensive language. He disregarded crew instructions to remain seated and made inappropriate comments. His behavior disrupted the cabin environment and created a hostile atmosphere for the crew.The flight attendants also managed a situation where they allowed extra forms for families with elderly grandparents, despite a shortage. The passenger falsely accused them of misconduct, which was later proven baseless. The result was a disruptive and hostile environment for the crew, prompting concerns about the passenger's potential legal action or future banning from the airline.

However, due to a hectic pre-takeoff taxi process, where passengers repeatedly needed to be reminded to sit down and fasten their seatbelts, the information was inadvertently forgotten. The lead FA proposed a potential solution: implementing a system in the computer to denote FFDOs with a triangle symbol, which could help ensure the information was readily accessible during busy boarding or pre-takeoff procedures. The incident resulted in the other FAs not being informed about the First Officer's role as an FFDO, but a solution was suggested to prevent similar occurrences in the future.","communication issues, crew-related issues, operational issues, training, between attendant and crew"

The crew was; at that moment not aware of any inoperative chiller on the aircraft. During the briefing with the Captain; and after checking the list of maintenance issues in my link; there was no mention about an inoperative chiller. The two carrier boxes posed a significant tripping hazard to our customers boarding; but the catering representative refused to remove the carrier boxes; stating that the flight attendants should take them on board. The carrier boxed where too heavy to lift; and it is my understanding that we should not carry heave carrier boxes full of dangerous goods through an aircraft with customers on board.

He was unwilling to listen or understand the problem with having two carrier boxes full of dry ice being placed in front of the boarding door while customers were boarding. At this point I was informed by the Captain that chiller number 7 in the aft galley had an issue and the fuse was pulled. No one informed the crew about this. In the interest of departing on time; and to satisfy the Supervisor who was getting more hostile by the minute; I decided to accept two bins of dry ice; that I hand carried on the aircraft myself. We then were able to close to boarding door and leave on time.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that a communication breakdown resulted in dry ice being brought onboard the aircraft without proper documentation.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between a flight attendant and a catering representative regarding the placement of two carrier boxes filled with dry ice in front of the boarding door. The flight attendant was not initially informed about an inoperative chiller, which the catering representative cited as the reason for leaving the boxes on the ground. The boxes posed a tripping hazard to passengers boarding the aircraft, but the catering representative refused to remove them, insisting the flight attendant take them on board. The boxes were too heavy for the crew to lift safely, and an In-Flight Supervisor present in the area was unhelpful and displayed aggressive behavior when the flight attendant attempted to resolve the issue. During the conflict, the Captain informed the crew that chiller number 7 in the aft galley had an issue, but the crew had not been previously notified. To de-escalate the situation and avoid further delays, the flight attendant decided to take the two bins of dry ice herself, carrying them onto the aircraft. This allowed the boarding door to close and the flight to depart on time.","communication issues, operational issues, safety related, between attendant and crew, equipment malfunction, crew-related issues"

I had my MFD on the status page before push and all doors showed green. We did before start flows and before start checklist. We were cleared to push and also to cleared to start engines shortly thereafter. I reached over and started engine one. The number one engine was fully online and had stabilized when we received a master caution. The EICAS message was saying that the front door on the FO (First Officer) side was ajar. By this time we had completed the push and the ground crew was working on getting the airplane ready for taxi. The Captain called back to the flight attendants to check on the door and maybe try to recycle it. We sat there as we heard the Flight Attendant try to get the door shut. After a few seconds of messing with the door; I heard a loud hiss and the airplane started shaking. At that point we had determined that the slide had been deployed. The Flight Attendant then called to let us know what had happened. He tried opening the door and then closing it again. This was an honest mistake and had no malicious intent. It was an abnormal situation in a high pressure environment.The cause could've been a quick misinterpretation of wording between the crew. The FA (Flight Attendant) was told to recycle the door and I've heard that wording can be misinterpreted throughout the whole [company] fleet.Change the wording in the in-flight manual for the words 'recycling doors.' I've heard it can mean something different in all the airplanes and I guess maybe it was taken one way or [another] the night of the incident.,,After push back in ZZZ on Aircraft X; we had an accidental slide deployment. Prior to push back; I verified the doors were green and told the ramp crew we were cleared to push. As we started the number 1 engine; once it came online we received a 'DOOR SERVICE FWD OPEN' warning message. I called back to the flight attendants and the number one answered. I had interrupted the safety demo that he was already doing. There must have been a perceived miscommunication as the next thing I knew there was a slide deployment. Thankfully no one was hurt when this honest mistake occurred and there was no willful intent by any crew member to deploy the slide.I believe the cause was miscommunication on the interphone between the CA (Captain) and the number one FA (Flight Attendant.) A contributing factor was the delayed flight and a rushed turn at the outstation.In the future I intend to treat any door issue similar to this event with a better initial reaction. First words to the FA will be to ensure the door is disarmed while following procedures more specifically.,,ERJ-175 flight crew reported an inadvertent emergency slide deployment after pushback.,"The incident involved an ERJ-175 flight crew and a flight attendant during departure from ZZZ. After starting the first engine, a warning indicated a forward door was ajar. The flight crew communicated with the attendant to check and recycle the door. During this, the emergency slide deployed, an inadvertent deployment with no injuries. The cause was attributed to a miscommunication regarding the term ""recycle,"" leading to confusion. Contributing factors included a delayed flight and rushed procedures. To prevent recurrence, the flight manual's terminology will be revised for clarity, and procedures will be followed more meticulously.","safety related, crew-related issues, emergency, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

The passenger was informed to take a seat at mid to aft cabin due to distribution on the 800 aircraft; stating there is plenty of overhead bin space at the back for his carry on that seemed a bit large for the more narrow/less deep bins up front. The passenger snapped at the D Flight Attendant indicating that he was going to do what he wanted to do.Flight Attendant D recognized that the tall male passenger sat in the OWWE (Overwing Window Exit) Row. As the D made her way back she stopped to see how the passenger was doing. He was glossy eyed and loud. Flight Attendant D inquired if he had been smoking and under the influence of a substance. The passenger replied 'Yes; all day long.'  Flight Attendant D clarified if he were referring to Marijuana? The passenger replied 'Yes; I voted for it and I have been smoking all day long. We just signed a deal...' Then showing his logo/ clothing brand.The D Flight Attendant congratulated him on his business dealt then proceeded to inform the B Flight Attendant of the concern having a person under the influence of a substance in the OWWE. The B Flight Attendant concurred stating that 'Under the influence of a drug/marijuana is the same as alcohol.'The D Flight Attendant informed the A Flight Attendant of the concern then went up to the forward galley to discuss with the A [Flight Attendant]. The C Flight Attendant conducted the OWWE brief.The A [Flight Attendant] proceeded to talk to the passenger. The D Flight Attendant informed the flight deck both Captain and First Officer. No verbal response was given to the D Flight Attendant from the flight deck.The A Flight Attendant informed me; the D Flight Attendant that the man was okay.The D; said 'No he's not - he is admittedly in front of many passengers; I can smell the marijuana; under a controlled substance; approved use in Captain is only for use in the home and at a minimum he should not be in the OWWE; if even on this plane however even people who smell as if they've been drinking are not to be allowed to board.' The A Flight Attendant responded by saying; 'I spoke to him and leaned in and could not smell it.'Later the B Flight Attendant stated that he appears under the influence of marijuana/a substance and is eating a lot of pretzels; referring to the munchies.Later the C Flight Attendant stated that he (C) 'Heard how the passenger was talking to the D Flight Attendant and told him to settle down.' As the D Flight Attendant - the C heard that the passenger said he had been smoking marijuana all day long why was he allowed to remain in the overwing window exit?I think the FAM (Flight Attendant Manual) needs to clarify the term 'Intoxicated' to define if it only refers to alcohol or any substance to include marijuana; meth; speed; cocaine. Particular clarification is suggested with respect to marijuana as it is now legal in many states. However I don't think those laws supersede federal law or Federal Aviation Regulations. I think that the flight deck/ops made an error in allowing the passenger to remain in the OWWE; even if they wanted to approve a stoned/person under marijuana passenger to be able to remain on the plane. I think the fatal error was made in saying 'The A said the passenger was okay. 'If the A Flight Attendant has the final say then please clarify for crew.  The C and B Flight Attendants are still on probation and the A has not been flying too long. Being able to answer a question 'Yes; I will help' is not very reassuring when someone is under the influence of a primarily illegal substance even if it is legal in some states. It is a known fact that reaction time and mental processing of information is delayed under the influence of marijuana and other drugs; legal or illegal.,,,,Flight Attendant reported that a person under the influence of marijuana was allowed to remain seated in the emergency aisle after admitting being under the influence.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who encountered a passenger emitting the odor of marijuana. The passenger admitted to smoking marijuana throughout the day and refused to comply with instructions to move to the mid to aft cabin. Flight attendants noticed the passenger's behavior, including his glossy eyes and loud demeanor, and expressed concerns about his condition. They debated whether he should be removed from the overwing window exit seat due to safety concerns. The flight deck was informed but did not provide a verbal response. The A Flight Attendant deemed the passenger acceptable, while others, including the B and C Flight Attendants, disagreed, noting the passenger's behavior and the potential risks of marijuana use. The situation highlighted the need for clarification in the Flight Attendant Manual regarding the definition of ""intoxicated"" to include substances like marijuana, despite its legal status in some states. The crew's handling of the situation and the adequacy of their judgment were questioned.","crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, operational issues, training, health and medical issues, between attendant and passengers"

Shortly after; we both felt our throats burning. C Flight Attendant said she also saw smoke inside the lavatory. passenger also seemed paranoid. We called the Captain and notified him of the events.Police met the aircraft and questioned the passenger. Initially passenger lied to the police saying he didn't do anything. Police Officers and TSA came onto the plane looking for evidence and could not find anything. When we deplaned the aircraft we stayed in the gate area while on the phone with Operations. In the gate area; we noticed the passenger shaking the police officers hand and walking away. As he was walking away; he dropped the vape pen on the ground and picked it up. We notified the police and they detained him. The police tested the vape pen and it tested positive for THC (marijuana). The passenger then confessed to smoking in the back lavatory and in the cabin among other passenger. At the time of writing this; my throat is still burning and I have a headache. I do feel a little off and not sure if it is the stress of the event or effects of the THC.,,Passenger came onboard; confused about seating. We explained to him we have an opening seating policy. When I came around to take his order; he; confusingly reading the menu; asked for items we didn't have on the menu. He then orders a Jack and Coke. I checked his ID to make sure he was of age and said no problem. As I was taking the next rows order; he interrupts me asking where to buy the snacks. I explained to him we'd be around shortly with pretzels as our snack option. As I went back to taking orders; he interrupts me again asking if he could use the lavatory. I explained to him the seatbelt sign was on and I was not able to give him permission as long as the seatbelt sign was illuminated. At this point; I finished taking orders and waited behind the B Flight Attendant as she finished taking her last row of orders. Passenger apparently got up right after I informed him the seatbelt sign was on because I felt a hard tap on my shoulder of him explaining he had to use the bathroom. I told him politely that we both needed to wait until she was done taking her last order. At this point; I informed the B of unusually behavior from him. As I was pouring drinks and the B was putting pretzels in the snack basket; the passenger came bolting out of the lavatory; leaving the door wide open. As I went to close the door; the B and I both realized he smelled strongly of marijuana. I walked into the lavatory and smelled an even greater odor of marijuana. There is no doubt in my mind at this point; that the passenger was smoking weed in the bathroom. We went up to talk to the A; called the Captain and all decided that we needed police assistance upon landing. We also decided to monitor the passenger. Passenger appeared paranoid and edgy as he watched us call the Captain and watched each of us every time we walked by. Upon landing; police met him and questioned him. He admitted to using a vape pen but said it was not marijuana. He said he could not find said vape pen. Ultimately he had to be let go for no evidence. As passenger was walking away; he [waved] good bye to police and the vape pen fell out of his pants. He was taken into custody and I wrote a police report. The vape pen was tested positive for marijuana. Passenger also admitted to smoking in the cabin during his interrogation.,,Flight attendants reported misconduct by a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight.,"The incident involved a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight, leading to a conflict with the flight attendants. The flight attendants noticed a strong smell of marijuana when the passenger exited the aft lavatory and observed smoke inside the lavatory. The passenger appeared paranoid and initially lied to the police about his actions. The flight attendants called the captain, and upon landing, police were summoned. During questioning, the passenger denied using marijuana but later admitted to smoking in the cabin and lavatory after a vape pen, which tested positive for THC, was found in his possession. The passenger was detained, and the flight attendants reported the incident to the authorities. The flight attendant experienced throat irritation and a headache, possibly due to the effects of THC exposure. The police confirmed the vape pen contained THC, leading to the passenger's confession and detention.","safety related, crew-related issues, emergency, fume/smoke incident, between attendant and crew, electronic cigarettes"

To me it appeared to be a hover board. I did question the Ops Agent; asked him if he looked it up; he said yes. He also told me TSA let them come through with it. I then asked him if he could show me. He then took the device and sent it down for cargo. I went to the Captain to bring it to her attention. I then started to look it up in my manual. I could not find verbiage regarding this particular device. Understanding it was a mobility device. Where it concerns me is Ops was not able to verify the type of battery in the device.,,Female passenger preboarded the aircraft using an assistive device that appeared to be a hoverboard with a handle. The A Flight Attendant (FA) inquired about the type of battery powering the device and the passenger didn't give a conclusive answer. She responded that in ZZZ; the ground staff consistently checked the device as checked baggage and in ZZZ1; they allowed her to stow the device in the wheelchair compartment; which was what I desired to do for her. The A FA and I communicated this to the Operations Agent; who curtly replied that TSA allowed it through and that he had tagged it to be checked. He never communicated with us that he had confirmed the type of battery inside the device and he verified that it was safe for travel in the cargo hold of the aircraft. If he had indeed safely verified he had checked the device thoroughly; he should have been able to answer the question about the type of battery powering the device and communicated that information with both the flight deck crew and the Flight Attendants. It is my belief that a potential safety violation occurred here; and if not; then the Operations Agent needed to communicate the information to the crew in a manner that allowed us to be sure that the device in question was carried safely. We departed ZZZ with that device in the cargo hold; unsure what type of battery was down there.,,Two air carrier Flight Attendants reported communication breakdown with Operations Agent regarding transport of battery powered 'Segway'.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between a flight attendant (FA) and ground personnel regarding the transport of a battery-powered Segway by a passenger. The passenger had boarded the aircraft using the Segway, which the FA perceived as a hoverboard. The FA questioned the Operations Agent (Ops Agent) about the type of battery in the device, as it was unclear and potentially concerning for safety reasons. The Ops Agent stated that TSA had approved the device and that it had been tagged as checked baggage. However, the Ops Agent did not confirm the type of battery or communicate this information to the flight deck crew and cabin staff, leaving the crew uncertain about the safety of the device in the cargo hold. The flight attendant attempted to verify the device's classification in the manual but found no relevant information. The incident concluded with the device loaded in the cargo hold, and the crew remained unsure about its safety. The FA expressed concerns about a potential safety violation or a failure in communication.

On the past five flights; Captains have insisted upon leaving the seat belt sign on for the entire flight. Some are so brazen they make an announcement prior to take-off advising the sign will be left on for the entire flight! Keep in mind; flying times range between 6.5 to 9.5 hours. On past flights; I have attempted to employ/educate using CRM strategies with some Captains in order to understand their reasoning behind their actions of keeping the sign on. Most express concerns about liability related to passenger injury due to unexpected severe turbulence. Others state they are doing flight attendants a favor by not cycling the sign off during late night flights - minimizing need for compliance checks. I'm deeply concerned the negative safety culture this type of behavior is creating -- a dangerous risk for passengers and crew. It encourages passengers to disobey the sign while fostering complacency among flight attendants. For example; during my last flight; FAs stopped enforcing the requirement for passengers to be buckled due to the sign being constantly on and lack of turbulence. Their reasoning (understandable); belts were unnecessary due to the smooth ride. At one point; I counted at least 15 passengers in the aisle while the sign was on. This occurred about seven hours into the flight; following the breakfast service. Clearly a violation of 121.311 and portions of 121.571. I witnessed this more often on long range flights.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant expressed concern in regard to the overuse of the seat belt.,"The incident involves concerns raised by a flight attendant regarding the excessive use of the seat belt sign by flight deck crews, particularly captains, on multiple flights. The flight attendant reported that captains frequently left the seat belt sign on for the entire duration of flights, which ranged between 6.5 to 9.5 hours. Some captains even made pre-flight announcements about this practice. The flight attendant attempted to address this issue with the captains using CRM strategies, but the captains cited concerns about liability in case of severe turbulence and claimed they were minimizing compliance checks for flight attendants during late-night flights as reasons for their actions. The flight attendant expressed deep concern over the negative safety culture this behavior was fostering, as it encouraged passengers to ignore the seat belt sign and created complacency among flight attendants. During one flight, the flight attendant observed at least 15 passengers in the aisle while the seat belt sign was on, approximately seven hours into the flight, following breakfast service. This situation violated Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 121.311 and portions of 121.571. The flight attendant noted that this behavior occurred more frequently on long-range flights. No specific solution was proposed in the context of the incident, but the flight attendant emphasized the need for addressing the safety risks associated with the misuse of the seat belt sign.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

In training we are told to open the lavatory; visually inspect; close the lavatory; and then lock it. The flight operations manual section states that the flight attendants will ensure the surrounding area is secure including all lavatories. B777 pilots are being verbally told to lock the lavatories doors open; language which is not in the flight operations manual. This concerns me as it is contradicting to what our security section/training calls for. Most of the time during pilot/Purser briefing I am acknowledged and the pilots comply with the proper security procedures. While working [a recent flight] I briefed the Captain as to what is required by our training. He refused to acknowledge the procedures outlined in our manual and I was forced to leave the lavatory doors open during cockpit entry/exit. This action compromised the integrity of security and left the cockpit vulnerable; however; because he was the Pilot in Command I was forced to comply.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported some pilots are requiring cockpit entry/exit procedures that are contrary to Flight Attendant training.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding cockpit entry/exit procedures. The flight attendant adhered to training and manual protocols, which require lavatory doors to be locked during cockpit access. However, some pilots have verbally instructed the flight attendants to keep the lavatory doors open, a practice not aligned with established procedures. During a recent flight, the flight attendant briefed the captain on the required security measures, but the captain refused to acknowledge them, forcing the flight attendant to leave the lavatory doors open. This compromise in security left the cockpit vulnerable. The flight attendant expressed concern over the inconsistency between training and pilot directives, which could potentially undermine safety protocols.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

At the same time the Number 2 FA picked up the inter-phone and began speaking. The Number 3 FA was a little bit frantic and vague in his communication. I attempted to get more information from him but he had hung up his inter-phone. About 30 seconds later; I called back to the Number 3 FA. He answered and I asked him to calm down and tell me what happened. He said the #1FA had hit his head on a 'tray table.' I asked if he was ok and did he need any medical assistance. He said the Number 1 FA was ok and no medical assistance was required. The remainder of the flight was without further issue. After parking the aircraft at ZZZ; I went back to the forward cabin to ask the Number 1 FA what happened. He had a small ice pack on his head. He removed it and had a light reddish bruise where he had obviously hit his head. I asked him to describe to me what happened. He said he was sitting in the FA jump seat; facing aft. When he stood up; he hit his head on the side of a metal tray which extends from the storage area just aft of the FA jump seat. I then asked him if he felt ok or needed medical assistance. He said he had a little bit of a 'headache' but otherwise felt ok. He said he felt ok to work the return leg to ZZZ1. He did request that when we arrived back to ZZZ1 that a supervisor meet us at the gate. I agreed that I would notify ZZZ1 Operations when we were in range. There was no turbulence or other weather related events. There were no external factors contributing to this injury. All normal procedures were being followed. All cabin crew members continue to be aware of their surrounding work environment and continue to exercise diligence. Flight attendants are trained how to handle medical situations in the cabin area and how to effectively communicate this to the flight deck. The Number 3 FA could have done a better job remaining calm; analyzing the non-life threatening situation and communicating this to the flight deck.,,,,B737-800 Captain reported poor communication with Flight Attendant relating to a Flight Attendant's injury.,"The incident occurred during the descent of a B737-800 aircraft into ZZZ, approximately 20 minutes before landing. The Number 1 Flight Attendant (FA) sustained a minor injury when his head struck a metal tray in the cabin while standing in the forward cabin. The Number 3 FA reported the injury to the flight deck via interphone, initially appearing frantic and vague. The Number 2 FA also attempted to communicate the situation. The captain, after calming the Number 3 FA, learned that the Number 1 FA was conscious, had a small bruise, and declined medical assistance. The Number 1 FA reported a minor headache but felt capable of continuing the flight. The flight landed without further issues, and the Number 1 FA requested a supervisor to meet the aircraft upon arrival at ZZZ1. The incident was attributed to a lack of awareness of the surrounding environment, though no turbulence or external factors were involved. The Number 3 FA was noted to have communication room for improvement in handling the situation.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

After the flight; in ZZZ1 during the debrief; we noted that the agent should not have closed the door without talking to the Number 1 Flight Attendant. Also noted was the fact that due to the busy and crowded flight deck; and the difficulty for me to turn around; and see if the person asking if it was clear to close; I apparently had given clearance to close to the agent and not the Flight Attendant. We agreed that agent was in the wrong to have closed the door without coordinating with the Number 1 Flight Attendant.Agent closed the door without the consent of the Number 1 Flight Attendant. This occurred because the agent failed to follow the correct procedure. The Flight Attendant is supposed to close the door; not the agent.Agents need to be trained that they must have the Number 1 Flight Attendant there to close the entry door. Pilots should make every effort to see that the person they are giving clearance to close is the Number 1 Flight Attendant and not the agent; although; as I stated this can be difficult to do at times with a busy crowded cockpit and doorway. The most important thing is that the agents not close the door without the Flight Attendant.,,,,A319-100 Captain reported the gate CSR did not follow company policy during the final passenger boarding procedures.,"The incident involved a miscommunication during the final boarding procedures of an A319-100 flight, where the entry door was closed by ground personnel without the consent of the Number 1 Flight Attendant. The pilot, unable to visually confirm who was requesting clearance due to a busy cockpit, assumed it was the Flight Attendant and granted permission. However, it was later discovered that the ground agent had closed the door, violating company policy, which mandates that the Flight Attendant must authorize such actions. During the post-flight debrief, it was determined that the ground personnel were at fault for not coordinating with the Flight Attendant. The crew acknowledged the challenge pilots face in confirming identities in a crowded cockpit. To prevent future occurrences, it was agreed that ground personnel should be trained to follow proper procedures and wait for the Flight Attendant's authorization before closing the door. Additionally, pilots were encouraged to make every effort to confirm the identity of the person requesting clearance, highlighting the importance of clear communication protocols. This incident underscores the need for enhanced training and communication to ensure adherence to company policies, emphasizing the crucial role of the Flight Attendant in such procedures.","communication issues, operational issues, between attendant and other people"

As we were ready to close the cockpit door; the A F/A (Flight Attendant) stated that we had 139 + 1 infant. I conferred with the [Gate] Agent; and confirmed with our F/A's that the infant was in fact in a lap and not in a seat. After a discussion on the radio; the [Gate] Agent confirmed that we did in fact have 139 + 1; as one boarding pass had not been scanned; even though that passenger had boarded. She sent us Version 2 of the Takeoff Data with the updated count; we re-accomplished the Before Push Checklist; and the flight proceeded normally.GENERAL SAFETY CONCERN: This isn't the first time I've had this situation occur. It's easiest to catch on full or nearly full flights with a senior 'C' F/A who still counts the number of empty seats before pushback. Various things can set up the situation where this error can occur; a boarding pass that isn't scanned will do it; or an [Gate] Agent who assumes that the thru count is correct without verifying can cause it as well. I've seen that too; the deplaning F/A's got a thru-count; but the [Gate] Agent never asked for it; and the oncoming F/A's were never asked or told what it was. The [Gate] Agent blindly assumed that the count was right; and she was wrong. (That error got caught because it occurred before the final passenger count was abolished.) With current procedures; if the thru-count is off and the subsequent flight isn't full; NOTHING will catch this sort of error after it gets made. 'What's the thru-count supposed to be? 28. Yeah; we have 28.' (No; you have 29; because the 4th Rider; in a seat; is staying on even though the operational information system thinks she's getting off here; but you didn't catch it because another passenger was using the lav when you counted and you weren't aware of it. Or because you got distracted during the count; and it was like 27 or 28 or something; and it's easier to say 'yeah; we have 28' than to go back and count again.) These errors happen ALL THE TIME; but now we are generally oblivious to them; whereas before the procedure change; 'count's off; have to count again' was common. Sometimes the F/A's count before push was simply off and the recount straightened everything out; but other times there was a real discrepancy between the number of people that the computer had on the aircraft; and the true number. The ramifications of errors like this are two-fold. First; the aircraft is operated with an inaccurate ZFW (Zero Fuel Weight) and Takeoff Gross Weight. This means that the aircraft is operated in a non-compliant manner with certainty; even though the actual impact of a 200 or even 400 pound error is essentially nil. Second; however; in the event of an aircraft accident; having an accurate count of Souls On Board can be absolutely vital; and an inaccurate count may be the difference between leaving someone on the aircraft who could be rescued; or sending a firefighter into an aircraft in search of an individual who was never there in the first place. In other words; an accurate count makes no difference whatsoever; until that one day when it is of life and death importance. It frankly astounds me that; at the same time that we obsess over 97 bags versus 98 bags (at 50 pounds each); with elaborate checks and verification between the ramp agents and the [Gate] Agent; we willingly forgo the best and only verification of what the computer says about our number of passengers (at 200 pounds each). How the FAA can require no counting of people actually onboard the aircraft at the same time they require exact accountability of bags; is beyond me. An extra passenger; as we had today; is four times as consequential in terms of aircraft weight as an extra bag; and infinitely more important as a soul to be rescued and accounted for in the event of an accident.The FAA should require Company to return to the previous practice of counting the actual number of people who are physically onboard the aircraft prior to pushing back from the gate. Yes; those counts take time; and when a Flight Attendant miscounts; it takes time to resolve the error. But; isn't an accurate count of the number of lives in our care worth it?,,,,B737 Captain reported an inaccurate passenger count prior to departure.,"An incident occurred involving a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding an inaccurate passenger count prior to departure. The flight captain noticed a discrepancy in the ""Souls On Board"" count, initially reporting 144 souls (138 passengers, 1 infant, and 5 crew) based on the Weight and Balance report. The flight attendant, however, stated there were 139 passengers plus an infant. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the infant was in a lap, not a seat. The flight crew consulted with the gate agent and verified the counts. A boarding pass had not been scanned, leading to the error. The gate agent confirmed the count and provided an updated Takeoff Data version, prompting a recalculation of the Before Push Checklist. The flight proceeded normally after the resolution. The flight captain highlighted that such discrepancies often occur due to unverified boarding passes or gate agents assuming counts are accurate without confirmation. They emphasized the critical importance of accurate passenger counts for aircraft weight calculations and emergency response, proposing that the FAA require a return to physically counting passengers before departure, despite the time it may take. This practice, the captain argued, ensures the safety and accurate accounting of lives on board.","between attendant and crew, crew-related issues, operational issues, safety related, communication issues, training"

Began the process of securing the galley and doing the last trash runs. However; final descent chime was not made or heard throughout the cabin. It was not until [we] looked out the service window; that they were able to notice the street lights coming into view. That was when the landing gear was [extending]. Both FA's (Flight Attendants) rushed through the cabin to try to assist passengers and secure the cabin. As FWD FA walked back to the galley; the momentum pushed her into a jog and she yelled at the AFT FA; 'Get down.' [AFT FA] was able to make it to her jump seat safely and secure herself. This momentum caused [another FA] to run into the flight deck door; hit her head and bounced off. Due to the stress of the situation; neither flight attendants were fully able to secure the cabin or galley before landing. FO (First Officer) said that he did do the chime but there was a system malfunction. Captain wrote up the plane after jet bridge was extended.,,,,CRJ900 Flight Attendant reported that the cabin crew was not alerted to final descent.,"The incident occurred on a CRJ900 flight when the final descent chime, intended to alert the cabin crew, malfunctioned and did not sound. As a result, the flight attendants were not promptly informed of the aircraft's preparation for landing. Approximately 20 minutes before landing, the initial descent announcement was made, and the flight attendants began securing the galley and performing last-minute tasks. However, the absence of the final descent chime caused them to remain unaware of the impending landing until they noticed street lights outside the aircraft, indicating that the landing gear was being extended. In response, the flight attendants rushed to secure the cabin and assist passengers. During this rush, the forward flight attendant was pushed into a jog and yelled for the aft attendant to ""Get down."" The aft attendant safely reached her jump seat, while another flight attendant collided with the flight deck door, sustaining a head injury. Due to the sudden and stressful situation, neither attendant was able to fully secure the cabin or galley before landing. The first officer reported that he had activated the chime but faced a system malfunction. The captain subsequently filed an incident report post-landing. This incident highlights the importance of reliable communication systems in ensuring passenger and crew safety during critical phases of flight.","equipment malfunction, operational issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

He immediately responded that he was a frequent flyer and didn't have to. I asked him politely stating that it was FAR procedure that bags that size be checked (it was over 21 inches in height and rather wide). He got belligerent and said he would be talking to the airline about the poor treatment. I apologized; stating that I was following procedure. He checked his bag and immediately came back saying he was being abused and that I had been yelling at him. At this point; I asked my Captain to see if there was anything he could do to alleviate his mood. My Captain politely talked to him; and the passenger sat down.Once everyone was on board and I got my final; I immediately did my announcements; count; and shut the door. When I did service; I asked him what he wanted and had him repeat it so I was certain I got it right. I then offered him his complimentary drink or snack because he was entitled to it. He got the [snack] box. I finished service; did a trash run; and as I am eating; he ripped back my galley curtain and demanded that I talk to the guy behind him who was rudely kicking his seat to not; because he should be allowed to keep his seat back. I nodded; and asked the guy behind him in [4C] to refrain from kicking him. It was painfully obvious that he wasn't doing it on purpose. The passenger in question was 6'5 and well over 350 pounds. He was just too big for the seat and was pressing against it; because his legs had nowhere else to go. I offered the passenger in 4C a different seat away from him and the passenger declined calling Passenger X an entitled baby and that he wasn't interested in moving for him. I did not respond in any way to the name calling; as I did not want to further gain Passenger X's ire; but I was very polite to both of them. About 25 minutes to landing; Passenger X asked for coffee. I told him we ran out; but offered to make him some. He declined.Other passengers remarked about his rude behavior and apologized to me. I didn't respond because it is unprofessional to do so. One woman told me I had the patience of a saint. Upon departing; he told the Gate Agent that I was drunk and rude. The Gate Agent talked to me and I explained that he was upset with me. She remarked that I definitely didn't seem drunk; just very happy go lucky.I boarded for the next [flight]. After shutting the doors; I started to do my safety announcements. I get a call from my Captain and notice the police are waiting. He had called the police and told them I was intoxicated. I don't drink. I haven't had alcohol in over 20 years. I explain this to the police and give them a statement and all my identification and information. I tell them I will fully cooperate with them and I am willing to give blood; pee in a cup; and take a drug or breathalyzer test. The police tell me I definitely do not appear to be drunk or on anything; but they must do a breathalyzer on me to document it. I absolutely complied immediately. I am given a breathalyzer and it comes out 00. The police apologized and I immediately go back to work.I will say that I am absolutely distraught that I was put in this situation. I am a very energetic and enthusiastic individual when it comes to doing my announcements. I am disheartened that my manners were misconstrued in anyway as I try to be as completely professional and polite to everyone I meet. I usually have a great time with my passengers and they always come out of my plane with a big smile on their face. I regret that I was unable to please this passenger at all; but I did everything within guidelines of behavior and professionalism. I really don't know what I could have done differently; except try to accept a bag that was too big for the bin.,,,,Flight Attendant reported a passenger became rude and disruptive after having to check in his carry on bag that was too big for the overhead bin.,"The incident involved a flight attendant and a passenger on a flight. The passenger, identified as Passenger X, became disruptive after being asked to check his large carry-on bag, exceeding the overhead bin's size restrictions. The flight attendant followed proper procedures, but Passenger X responded with belligerence, complaining of poor treatment and later accusing the attendant of yelling at him. Despite apologies and attempts to manage the situation, including involving the captain, the passenger's behavior persisted. During the flight, he made further disruptive demands, including regarding another passenger's seat behavior. Upon disembarking, Passenger X falsely accused the flight attendant of being intoxicated. The captain reported this to the authorities, leading to a police investigation. The flight attendant complied with all requested tests, including a breathalyzer, which confirmed no impairment. The investigation concluded with no evidence of intoxication, allowing the attendant to return to work. The attendant expressed regret over the passenger's misinterpretation of her professionalism and energy, emphasizing adherence to protocol.","between attendant and passengers, disruptive, training"

Captain insisted they could still fly without it. His alternate protocol was to open the flight deck door during takeoff and landing. Flight Attendant X was very uncomfortable with this and was saying it is against what her manual says. She was peer pressured and guilted by the Captain into operating all four flights with the flight deck door open. The company has taken on more contracts than they can handle with their fleet and amount of crew members. Aircraft have fallen into disrepair; and those who complain about it are punished; those who operate flights illegally get more money in their pockets. This Captain is notorious for flying any aircraft and allowing crew scheduling to manipulate his hours so that he can work more than what is legal for a big chunk of money. I contacted manager of inflight; Chief Pilot; Director of Operations; and Director of Safety prior to flying this morning. I showed them that the manual says 'an aircraft cannot depart if the interphone system between flight deck and cabin is inoperative.' I contacted another Captain who showed me that even on the MEL list; at least 50 percent of cabin interphones must be able to reach flight deck. None of ours did. I only received a reply from our Director of Operations saying that 'In certain circumstances it can be done.' He then stated he did not find it safe for a Captain to take off and land with the flight deck door open. However this Captain will never receive any questioning about his protocol because the company is just relieved the flights operated.,,,,Flight Attendant reported aircraft interphone was inoperative and the Captain continued the operation with flight deck door open.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and a Flight Captain regarding the operation of a flight with an inoperative interphone system. The Flight Attendant reported that the interphone system, which is a critical communication link between the flight deck and cabin, was not functioning. According to the aircraft manual, the aircraft should not depart if the interphone system is inoperative. However, the Captain insisted that the flight could proceed by opening the flight deck door during takeoff and landing as an alternative protocol. The Flight Attendant expressed discomfort with this approach, as it contradicted the manual, but was reportedly pressured and guilted by the Captain into complying with the protocol for four consecutive flights. The incident highlights issues within the company, including overloading its fleet and crew capacity, aircraft disrepair, and a culture where those who raise concerns about safety are punished, while those who operate flights illegally are rewarded financially. The Flight Attendant had previously raised concerns with multiple senior management personnel, including the Director of Operations, who acknowledged the potential safety risk but did not take definitive action to prevent the flight. The Captain, known for maximizing his flying hours and earnings, was not held accountable for his protocol, despite the risks involved. In summary, the incident reflects systemic management and safety concerns within the organization, including disregard for safety protocols, crew well-being, and regulatory compliance. A potential solution proposed was to review the manual's requirements, assess the Captain's flight hours, and investigate the interphone system's compliance with the MEL (Minimum Equipment List).","between attendant and crew, crew-related issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, safety related"

I was given a shuttle to the maintenance hangar to get onboard. When the FO and I had everything ready; I opened my window to speak with the ground agent standing outside. He said he had never towed from here before; and he didn't have a headset or wing-walkers. We were parked tightly at an angle between other things; so I asked him if he could get a headset and helpers. I also called maintenance to see if they could send someone out to help the guy. Finally; [the ground agent] came back with a headset and helpers; and he was fabulous about getting us pulled out. We flew to ZZZ and landed just after midnight. We landed and were cleared to the gate. As we were about to turn left; an airport bus almost drove right in front of us going westbound along the road. I hit the brakes. He stopped; but he stopped too close for me to go past him. I flashed all my lights at him and we told ground about that happened. The vehicle behind the bus flashed lights several times. We all needed him to back up but he didn't get it. Then he gunned it and drove right in front of us. We told ground; and I called the tower to clarify the details after landing. The bus was a blue and white design. When we arrived at [the] gate; the agent had positioned the jetway and then left. So we had to wait about 15 minutes for an agent to come and let us out of the jetway in order to avoid setting off security alarms. Make sure bus drivers on the ground know that they should give way to aircraft.,,,,An aircraft Captain reported he had to abruptly apply the brakes to avoid a bus driving in front of the aircraft.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and ground personnel during aircraft operations. The flight attendant reported being sent messages about a reassignment to an empty airplane and subsequent flights. While preparing for departure, the flight attendant communicated with a ground agent who lacked necessary equipment (headset and wing-walkers) and experience in towing the aircraft from the location. After resolving this initial issue with the help of maintenance, the flight attendant proceeded to ZZZ, landing just after midnight. Upon landing and taxiing to the gate, the flight attendant encountered a near-accident when an airport bus failed to yield, nearly driving in front of the aircraft. The flight attendant had to apply brakes abruptly to avoid collision. Despite communication with ground personnel and the tower, the bus driver did not comply, creating a safety hazard. The aircraft was eventually positioned at the gate, but the ground agent left the jetway unattended, requiring a 15-minute wait for assistance to avoid triggering security alarms. The flight attendant recommended that ground personnel, particularly bus drivers, be informed to yield to aircraft to prevent similar incidents.","between attendant and other people, communication issues, safety related, operational issues"

We were on hold with Scheduling when they called me asking if I wanted to go over 16 hours; I responded no. I find this a safety issue; we were definitely fatigued and they were trying to push us past the limit.,,,,CRJ Flight Attendant reported the company manipulated block time to remain within the required work period.,"A conflict occurred between a CRJ flight attendant and the crew scheduling department regarding the manipulation of block time for a trip originating from JFK.

The attendant and a coworker were informed that they were approaching the 26-hour mark and were at 15:43 hours when contacted. Although the flight was delayed by an additional 40 minutes, the block time was shortened, resulting in an earlier arrival but a later departure. The flight attendant expressed concern over this scheduling decision, citing fatigue and safety risks, and refused to work beyond the 16-hour limit.

We arrived at the aircraft and passenger boarding began without any crew briefing from the Captain. Upon door closure; we were notified that the ramp was closed; and we would be sitting for at least 15 minutes; potentially more. I called the cockpit to see if our brake was released (wondering; 'are we receiving flight pay/ATC hold pay for this delay?'). The Captain informed us that 'No-we aren't getting paid a penny to sit here!' We finally were able to leave the gate. Upon taxiing out; we were notified that we would not be departing for some time. We parked and the engines were shut down at some point. The passengers moved about the cabin to the lavatories during this delay. Approximately one hour later; the engines came back on and we heard the announcement 'Prepare for takeoff.' We made an announcement for passengers to return to their seats and bring their seatbacks and tray tables forward; as well as to stow laptops.While conducting our compliance check; I noticed that we were turning onto the runway and beginning to accelerate. The Number 4 Flight Attendant and I struggled to get to our jumpseats as the airplane was taking off. Following take off; there was a substantial amount of turbulence during the climb out. I called the Number 1 Flight Attendant and asked if they had heard a chime before takeoff. They had NOT; and indicated they had been scrambling to get to their jumpseats in time; as well. The Captain finally called to indicate it was probably safe to get up. I called him back to tell him that we were all in the aisle during takeoff; and that we did not hear a takeoff chime. He immediately defended himself; saying 'YES WE DID; we said prepare and chimed;' to which I replied 'Regardless; four of us did NOT hear the chime; and we were in the aisle during takeoff.' He told me that we would 'have a discussion on the ground.'Upon landing the Captain made no comment to us; and when the Number 4 Flight Attendant asked if we were going to discuss what had happened in the crew van; the Captain answered with a loud 'NO!' Pilots should always verify if the cabin is ready for takeoff following a significant delay and sit on the tarmac. A pilot briefing should always be conducted; even if flight is delayed.,,,,B737-800 Flight Attendant reported not receiving the proper pre-takeoff warning from the cockpit.,"The incident involved a B737-800 flight where the cabin crew reported not receiving the proper pre-takeoff warning from the cockpit. The flight attendant, working a delayed flight, noticed that the cabin crew did not hear the takeoff chime despite the Captain claiming it was heard. This omission led to confusion and safety concerns during takeoff, as the cabin crew was still in the aisle when the aircraft began accelerating. The Captain defended his actions, but no resolution was reached post-landing. The flight attendant suggested that pilots should verify cabin readiness after delays and conduct briefings to prevent such issues.","communication issues, safety related, between attendant and crew"

So; I wrote up aft cargo door L/H blowout panel and FWD LAV upper track guide screw which was broken in half. Maintenance arrived and began to thoughtfully address the issues. I was informed by a Line Mechanic that the blow out panel was missing 3 of 4 fasteners and they were checking on if they had another panel in stock. Shortly after that; a Maintenance Foreman or Supervisor showed up and said we're all good; everything is being signed off. I didn't see the new part arrive; so I asked the Foreman if they had brought and installed a new panel. He said; 'Yes; we installed the new panel and you're good to go.' When I later spoke with the Line Mechanic who actually did the work; he said they had not installed a new part; but had just taped in the old one. So; I found the Foreman and explained to him what was wrong with the old panel (3 missing fasteners) and that reinstalling it wasn't solving the problem. At that point; his story changed and he said they had found the fasteners in the cargo bay and reinstalled them into the panel before taping it up; so once again we are good to go! Then; he left. The remaining line mechanics were completing the paper work for the LAV door repair when I told the one who had done the work in the cargo how fortunate it was that they had found the 3 missing panel fasteners to which he looked befuddled and told me they hadn't found or installed any new fasteners; just taped in the old panel. He said that was why he refused to do the sign off on that job... so the Foreman signed it off. I called Maintenance Control and asked for Maintenance to reinspect the panel and was told they would do so and then 'rub your belly'. When Maintenance arrived to reinspect the panel; I was present when he removed the tape and panel which was still missing 3 of its 4 required ball-bearing fasteners. A new panel was ordered and another write-up was requested; which I did. During the delay; passengers were receiving regular updates and provided a water service. I had also tried to arrange regress to those who wanted off to reset the ground delay clock; but the Station refused to allow only a few off - it had to be all or nothing. When the new panel was ordered I deplaned all of the passengers. The part arrived and was installed fairly quickly; so we re-boarded and were preparing to depart when someone attempted to use the forward LAV and the door fell off its upper track again. We found the upper track screw on the floor and it was the exact same dirty one that was broke in half prior to the first repair. For some unknown reason; the broken screw (bolt) was reinstalled on the LAV door; so I wrote it up again. Maintenance came out and determined a new part or whole new door would be required which they said would take at least an hour; so we deplaned all of the passengers a second time. After the new LAV door was installed; it did not fit well and was scraping metal on metal across the top of the door; making the door hard to open and close; so I asked them to adjust it. They tried; but in the end; said it was as good as it was going to get. The door did open and close just not easily which in my opinion; will probably lead to another upper track screw failure; but it was signed off; so we boarded and finally completed the flight after a 4 hour and 16 minute delay. There is no doubt in my mind that the Maintenance Foreman lied directly to my face multiple times regarding maintenance that was supposedly performed; that is not acceptable. It was an unsafe act that could have been the first link in the chain of an accident/incident had I not intervened. By trying to save an hour delay; he caused a 4+ hour delay. I was told that this push; push; push; go; go; go; get it out by whatever means possible pressure was common place for that Foreman. I am concerned that his concept of risk management allowed him to reinstall a known defective piece of safety equipment (the pressurization blowout panel); sign it off; and lie about it to the Captain. Do maintenance correct the first time. Don't falsify maintenance signoffs and don't lie to crew members about the condition of their aircraft.,,,,CRJ-900 Captain reported the aircraft was refused because the corrective action taken and explanation by Maintenance was unacceptable.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and Maintenance personnel regarding the resolution of aircraft maintenance issues on a CRJ-900 aircraft. The Flight Attendant reported two problems during boarding: a protruding aft cargo L/H blowout panel and a broken upper track guide screw on the forward lav door. Maintenance was summoned, and a Line Mechanic noted that the blowout panel was missing three of four fasteners. A Foreman arrived and assured the Flight Attendant that the issues had been resolved, claiming a new panel had been installed and signed off. However, the Flight Attendant later discovered that the old panel had only been taped in place without the missing fasteners. The Foreman's story changed, claiming the fasteners had been found and reinstalled, but this was contradicted by the Line Mechanic, who admitted no new fasteners had been installed. The Flight Attendant raised concerns, leading to a reinspection by Maintenance, which confirmed the panel was still missing fasteners. A new panel was ordered, and passengers were deplaned and reboarded multiple times due to delays. Despite the replacement, the forward lav door again failed during the flight, with the broken screw reinstalled. Maintenance ultimately installed a new door, but it did not fit properly, causing metal-on-metal contact and difficulty in operation. The Flight Attendant expressed strong concerns about the Foreman's dishonesty and unsafe practices, which could have led to a potential accident. The incident resulted in a 4-hour and 16-minute delay. The Flight Attendant emphasized the need for accurate maintenance signoffs, honesty, and thoroughness to prevent such incidents in the future. The aircraft was eventually cleared for flight after the issues were addressed.","between attendant and crew, equipment malfunction, operational issues, crew-related issues"

A paramedic and a nurse are assisting an ill passenger in seat 19b. Paramedics are waiting at destination. No ATC [notification was made].We see a small; individual cell ahead on radar: about 4 miles wide with light green rain indication and small amber center. We receive deviation clearance to the left from Control. We change course and continue descent. Visibility zero. When abeam of the cell on our right side; we flew through some imbedded cumulus and a short burst of rain. We received a quick; sudden jolt of moderate turbulence.I called back to the cabin via intercom to check with the cabin crew. I apologized about the event with no warning from us. I was assured that everything was okay although FA C sounded a bit unhappy about the event.We landed and arrived at the gate at [destination] with paramedics waiting to examine the ill passenger. A lot of confusion at the gate after the passengers deplaned with an army of cleaners coming aboard to 'turn' the aircraft. I saw FA A was moving aft to speak to FAs C and B while the cleaners and ground supervisors were on the airplane between us. The paramedics had left the jetway with the ill passenger. It was going to be difficult to wade through the cleaners to speak to my crew who were scheduled to fly the aircraft back to [origin]. Not having heard from them while at the gate; [First Officer] and I assumed our cabin crew were okay. We exited the aircraft to start our overnight.24 hours later; [First Officer] and I arrived at the aircraft for the northbound flight to [origin]. FA C and FA B were present and met us. It was then when we heard that they had sustained injury during the previous day while standing in the rear galley from the moderate turbulence jolt event. Both crew members complained of back and shoulder strain. In addition; FA C had sustained a small cut on her hand while grabbing a hand hold to steady herself.The event occurred because I failed to warn the cabin crew of possible moderate turbulence during descent. So; the crew was completing normal duties when the unexpected turbulence occurred. As is well known; turbulence effects are magnified when in the aft section of aircraft and also there was no warning of small bumps before the big jolt took place.I need to communicate better with my cabin crew during flight to warn them about turbulence ahead and also at the gate after such an event (by intercom; if necessary); to make sure that they are okay. I am not happy about my lack of knowledge about my cabin crew condition as I left the aircraft. One of my roles is to make sure they are okay and to assist them if they are not okay.,,,,A319 Captain reported learning the next day that Flight Attendants had been injured during an inbound turbulence encounter.,"An incident occurred during the descent of a flight, 100 miles north of the destination, where the flight crew encountered embedded thunderstorms with zero visibility. The flight crew deviated around a small thunderstorm cell, resulting in a sudden jolt of moderate turbulence. The cabin crew, including flight attendants B and C, were in the rear galley and were injured during the turbulence, sustaining back and shoulder strains, with FA C also receiving a minor hand injury. The incident was primarily due to the captain's failure to warn the cabin crew about the impending moderate turbulence, particularly considering the increased turbulence effects in the aft section of the aircraft. The flight crew descended through solid cirrus clouds, encountering light turbulence and using weather radar. Encountered a thunderstorm cell, leading to deviation and moderate turbulence. Cabin crew, assisting an ill passenger, were injured during the turbulence. Post-incident confusion at the gate hindered immediate communication with the cabin crew. The cabin crew sustained injuries, and the captain realized the need for improved communication regarding turbulence warnings and post-incident checks. Enhance communication with the cabin crew about upcoming turbulence and use the intercom to ensure their well-being after such events. The incident highlights the importance of timely warnings and effective communication to ensure the safety and well-being of the cabin crew during turbulent conditions.","communication issues, crew-related issues, health and medical issues, safety related, weather related, between attendant and passengers"

After arrival and shutdown at ZZZZ, the flight crew, including the designated operator (the flight attendant) and an observer (the captain), went to the courier area to disarm the entry doors. During the process, the captain noticed the L1 door arming panel handle was already in the disarmed position (green). The flight attendant attempted to arm the door by positioning the handle to armed (red), but the captain intervened, instructing her to return it to the disarmed position. The flight attendant then verified the girt bar flags were out of view. The right side door was also found disarmed, and the captain confirmed both doors were disarmed, announcing ""doors clear."" No further incident occurred after the flight attendant cracked open the L1 door. The cause of the incident was attributed to last-minute departure route changes just prior to departure, which led the flight attendant to not arm the doors and the captain to overlook the manual memo message regarding the doors. The crew agreed that fatigue and distractions could have contributed to the situation. The proposed solution was to ensure a more thorough review of EICAS messages to prevent similar incidents.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

The gate agents stated that I could not go down to the plane because the security search was being done. I then asked when did that start and the 3 gate agents looked at me as if I was speaking in a foreign language. At XX:18 the gate agent let down my First Officer and said I still could not go down while the security search was being conducted so I then called crew scheduling to notify them as to what is going on. After hanging up the phone one of the gate agents then says to me not every aircraft get a security search. I tell her I'm very well aware that first flights of the day as well as aircrafts that were in a non-secure area receive security searches. I work this same flight serval times a month and no one has ever told me I could not be on the plane while a security search was being done. They then call someone on the phone and a fourth person comes over. They walk me down the jet bridge to 'check' and see if the security search was finished and it is now XX:25; I'm still being denied access to the aircraft. I see the time and state we will not be boarding on time. The male says excuse me and I repeated we will not be boarding on time. He says boarding is 25 mins prior to departure so I tell him my report time is XX:15 not XX:25 I have first flight of the day duties that I need to do and have a report time for a reason. You have denied me access to the aircraft at the time I was supposed to be so we will not be boarding until I'm ready and that's when I was granted access to the plane. As I'm conducting my pre-flight Captain comes and asked me if I was ready and I said no! I literally just got on the plane they are not going to rush me. When I walk back to the front of the plane there are several more people standing on the jet bridge as if they were trying to intimidate me. After the [allotted time] was up for me to charge the floor path lighting I told them I was ready. After the gate agent hands me the paper work she asked could she pull the jet bridge and I tell her no. I make my announcements and conduct the cabin count. When I return to the front to give the Captain the count; there is a slew of gate agents on the jet bridge staring me down.If not being allowed access to the aircraft during a security search is indeed procedure; it needs to be followed daily and not just a random day out of the blue. It should also be applied to all crew members. What is the difference between the pilot and I? We put our bags in the same closet.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being denied access to their aircraft during a security check.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant arrived at the gate for their scheduled report time but was denied access to the aircraft due to a security search being conducted. The flight attendant questioned the procedure, as they were unfamiliar with being restricted from boarding during the search. After several attempts to resolve the issue, including contacting crew scheduling and being transferred to a fourth person, the flight attendant was eventually granted access to the aircraft after a 10-minute delay. The delay caused the boarding process to be pushed back, and the flight attendant expressed concerns about the inconsistency in applying the security procedure to crew members. The incident was resolved when the flight attendant was finally allowed on the plane, completing their pre-flight preparations and boarding duties. The flight attendant suggested that if such procedures are standard, they should be consistently applied to all crew members.","crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

He asked me to close the cockpit door. As I was trying to close the cockpit door with no success; I continued to try 2 more times; when the Captain shouted angrily! 'Don't slam the damn door.' He repeated it several times; while slamming his hand on the Yoke! 'Don't you ever slam that door again; I'm sick of flight attendants slamming this door.' This was clearly a loss of temper heard by other crewmembers. I stood in fright and shock. After a moment; I told him his outburst was unacceptable and unprofessional for my attempts to close the door. It was then that First Officer explained how the door could be closed. He realized that the door closing mechanism switch (red toggle switch) was not engaged and was preventing me from shutting the door. The door was finally closed; and we departed. There are other events that gave me serious concerns about Captain [name removed].During the flight; the Captain asked for a bathroom break. I was terrified of being alone with him; so I asked another Flight Attendant to stay with me while I stood by the cart barricade. When he came out of the cockpit; he tried to intimidate me by staring me down; I ignored him. When he was finished using the lavatory; Flight Attendant [name removed] and myself noticed Captain fumbling with the keypad on the cockpit door; after several attempts; we were concerned. Flight Attendant [name removed] told him not to press so many numbers; as it would lock him out. He clearly did not know the door code; Flight Attendant [name removed] told him the door code.Captain [name removed] made it clear to us that he did not want us to use the door key pad; he wanted us to call the cockpit whenever we are to enter the cockpit. This is not in the Standard Operating procedures for flight attendants.During his briefing; he told us that while he's taxiing and if a passenger goes to the lavatory; he doesn't want us to call him; because he does not consider these events 'important or an emergency.'I am reporting this event as a 'Hostile Workplace Environment Incident' and that the matter be forwarded to the proper administrative forum. I make no personal request or recommendation for resolution as there should be standard procedure for handling 'Hostile Workplace Incidents.',,,,Flight Attendant reported a negative interaction with the Captain.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant (Party 1) and the Captain (Party 2) of the flight crew. During the pre-flight preparation, the Flight Attendant attempted to close the cockpit door but was unsuccessful. The Captain became visibly angry, repeatedly shouting at the Flight Attendant not to slam the door, which was witnessed by other crew members. After the Flight Attendant expressed concerns about the Captain's outburst, the First Officer intervened and explained that the door closing mechanism switch was not engaged, preventing the door from closing. The issue was resolved after the door was successfully closed. During the flight, the Captain requested a bathroom break, and the Flight Attendant expressed fear of being alone with him, asking another Flight Attendant to stay nearby. The Captain reportedly attempted to intimidate the Flight Attendant after using the restroom and appeared confused while trying to input the cockpit door code. The Flight Attendant intervened and provided the code, noting that the Captain did not know it. The Captain also instructed the crew not to use the door keypad, which is not in line with standard operating procedures. The Flight Attendant reported the incident as a ""Hostile Workplace Environment Incident,"" citing the Captain's unprofessional behavior, including his disregard for safety protocols and intimidating actions. The Flight Attendant requested that the matter be forwarded to the appropriate administrative forum for resolution, noting that standard procedures should address such incidents.","crew-related issues, safety related, operational issues, disruptive, between attendant and crew"

Captain failed to warn us of documented turbulence enroute [to] Oakland; failed to keep us seated throughout the flight; and Captain failed to keep us as safe as reasonably possible while performing our inflight responsibilities.Turbulence was both moderate and severe and lasted from the time we began drink service which we were unable to finish past one tray to the time we landed. It is inconceivable how the duration and severity of turbulence would not have been known to the Captain prior to flight. This is a heavily traveled route by both commercial and non-commercial air traffic and it is my understanding that turbulence of this nature should be included in the turbulence plots and weather briefings the Captain is required to obtain and share with his crew prior to departure.Secondly; were there no PIREPs indicating how severe and lengthy the frequency of turbulence was that evening? This is not the only time this has happened. In fact it occurs at [airline] every day practically. Captains in general almost never brief us on weather and when we ask if it will be okay to get up at 10;000 feet to begin service on short flights we are usually told yes. Then; we are bumped and rocked all over the place and never told to sit down until we are in the bad turbulence or the turbulence event has already occurred. We are not being given the weather briefings we deserve prior to flight and Captains are repeatedly not briefing us at all thus compromising our safety.In this particular instance; I woke up this morning with an aching back from the twisting and turning and jarring of my body during the turbulence. The Captain only communicated with us once the event was in full occurrence telling us to take our seats and to remain seated. We were not able to conduct any service beyond the one tray of drinks we in the back were able to distribute. The galley was a mess with spilled drinks everywhere and we were being thrown violently as we attempted to secure the galley.We were unable to collect garbage or secure the cabin for arrival due to the severity and duration of this event. Customers who purchased cocktails from me were never refunded their money because there was no way to do so safely. I ask why it is that the PIREPs of severe turbulence were not communicated to us by the Captain (as is all too often the norm); and why no preflight briefing was conducted by the Captain (also the norm at [airline]) . I also ask why it is we are required to serve drinks on very short flights and how that is considered safe. Some of our flights are barely 50 or 55 minutes block to block. We can't get up until 10;000 feet and must 1. Take drink orders 2. Pour the drinks 3. Balance trays with drinks on them and distribute them; then offer a snack service; conduct trash cleanup; offer seconds on drinks; again do a round of trash; and in addition restock the galleys on many flights. How is this safe?If you do the math the actual time we have to do all this is approximately 20 to 25 minutes and we are not allowed to simply do a water service. It appears safety of flight attendants is not a concern at [airline] as demonstrated by the overall lack of concern and failure of cockpit crews to brief us on matters paramount to our safety and managements disinterest in hearing how unsafe doing a full beverage service is on our shortest flights. When will you; the FAA; step up to the plate and hold our pilots responsible when they do not brief us even when there is an abundance of information available to us and when will you hold Management responsible for their unwillingness to deviate from unsafe practices?,,,,Flight Attendant reported not being informed in a timely manner or at crew briefing about turbulence reported along the flight path.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and the flight crew (Party2) regarding safety practices and communication during a flight. The flight attendant reported that the captain failed to conduct a pre-flight weather briefing or general briefing, did not warn the crew about documented turbulence along the route to Oakland, and allowed the flight attendants to move about the cabin despite severe turbulence. The turbulence, which lasted from the start of drink service to landing, was described as both moderate and severe, with the flight attendant experiencing physical strain and being unable to complete their duties safely. The flight attendant also criticized the lack of timely communication from the captain and questioned the safety practices, such as requiring full beverage service on short flights, which they argued compromised their safety. The flight attendant raised concerns about the captain's failure to brief the crew on known turbulence, the absence of pre-flight briefings, and the systemic issues within the airline, including the lack of action from management and the FAA to address these practices. The flight attendant requested that the FAA hold the captain and management accountable for these unsafe practices and ensure safer working conditions for flight attendants. In summary, the incident stemmed from a failure to provide timely and adequate safety briefings, leading to a hazardous work environment for the flight attendant and highlighting broader safety concerns within the airline.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

My working position on the aircraft required me to work the top of the meal cart and then spin to assist with the bar cart drinks. When I got far enough down the aircraft with the meals; I left Flight Attendant Y to finish distributing the meals and I then walked up the aisle to assist Flight Attendant X with the bar cart and drinks. I did not even have a chance to get my hands on the bar cart when he carelessly and quickly pushed it down the aisle towards me and struck an arm rest spilling both coffee and tea carafes all over one passenger. Flight Attendant X's hands never left the bar cart. I lunged to try to catch the carafes as they fell; but was unable to help. I immediately apologized to the passenger several times; all while trying to hold the hot soaked part of his sweater on his shoulder away from his skin; trying to pick up the carafes while Flight Attendant X is still shoving the cart onto me. I got up and thought he was assisting the passenger further but no he did not. He continued to push the cart down the aisle and continue service. I twisted my left knee when lunging for the hot carafes. I still thought that Flight Attendant X was attending to the passenger while I was pinned on the other side of the cart. I told him that he needed to slow down three times because he hurt me and the passenger. While in pain; I continued with the service. I had done my best to squat down to the bottom bin and grab a beer for a passenger; just before I stood up Flight Attendant X pushed the cart forward and I struck my forehead and nose on the tray on the cart. He sarcastically stated; 'Oh there you are!' I don't understand why he would push the cart forward when he saw me there. He saw me reach for the beer. I have a bruise on my nose and it hurts when I wear my prescription glasses. Flight Attendant X was aggressive verbally with the passengers and the entire crew but specifically honed in on myself and purser; Flight Attendant Z. We were the only women working the flight. He consistently undermined Flight Attendant Z by disobeying her authority. We had turbulence and Flight Attendant Z; after checking with the pilots on the situation; decided that it was not safe to bring the carts into the aisle. Flight Attendant X specifically ignored Flight Attendant Z's orders and took the cart into the aisle to serve while the remaining flight attendants used pick up pans to distribute drinks.  Flight Attendant X caused an unsafe; and uncomfortable work environment. How am I to react when I learned that he had stated to Flight Attendant A that he was going to 'xx Me Up!' I was afraid to be anywhere near him at this point and did not know what to do. I was afraid to talk to him because I did not want to inflate this situation. I have never worked in an environment where I have feared for my safety.,,,,Flight Attendant reported being in an unsafe situation and injured by another Flight Attendant's actions.,"The incident involved two flight attendants, Party1 (Flight Attendant X) and Party2 (Flight Attendant Y). Flight Attendant X was described as acting unprofessionally, recklessly, and aggressively while handling the bar cart. During service, X carelessly pushed the bar cart down the aisle, striking an armrest and spilling hot beverages on a passenger. Flight Attendant Y attempted to assist but was injured when she lunged to catch the falling carafes, twisting her left knee. Despite Y's injuries, she continued to apologize to the affected passenger and attempt to clean the spill. Y also reported being struck in the forehead and nose by the bar cart when X pushed it forward as she was trying to assist another passenger. Flight Attendant X was noted to have disregarded safety protocols, including ignoring Flight Attendant Z's orders to avoid bringing carts into the aisle during turbulence. Instead, X continued to push the cart into the aisle while other flight attendants used pickup pans. Additionally, X was described as verbally aggressive with passengers and the crew, specifically targeting Y and Flight Attendant Z, and undermining Z's authority. The situation created an unsafe and uncomfortable work environment. Flight Attendant Y reported feeling unsafe and feared for her safety after X made a threatening statement, stating he would ""xxx her up,"" which left her feeling afraid and unsure of how to proceed. The result of the incident was a hostile work environment, physical injuries to Flight Attendant Y, and emotional distress. No specific solution was proposed in the context of the incident.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

First passenger was seated in 8C with cabin pet in carryon kennel. Second passenger was 25A with small dog tucked under her coat. First Animal; [seat] 8: [The] dog remained in kennel for entire flight and did not cause disruptions. However; what caught my attention during boarding was passenger had to swap seats (at my recommendation) with 9D due to 8C's kennel unable to fit under her seat. The kennel was blocked due to the IFE power box under 8C. It should also be noted that PETC [Pet in Cabin] was not discovered as undocumented until inflight; thus ZZZ ground staff was not alerted about this animal prior to departure.Second animal [seat] 25A: Requested [passenger's] seat number as she boarded since I had not noted no pets on the Special Services List during preflight briefing. As boarding continued; I refreshed my Flight Attendant tablet to check if passengers with dogs were a last minute add to the manifest. However [passenger] was checked-in but no reference to ESA or SVAN [Emotional Support Animals and Service] on The Tablet seat map. Also; [I] referenced a fresh copy of the Special Services list no documentation.  I then contacted the female gate agent via phone and advised that we had a passenger with an undocumented cabin pet aboard while providing seat assignment. Prior to door closure; I witnessed [customer service representative] come onboard and question [the passenger].  I overheard him asked what type of service passenger's animal provided. The passenger responded; but I was unable to hear her answer. Later noted after landing that passenger's PNR had been updated reflecting her dog was a medic alert animal -- thus making it a SVAN. However; the dog had no exterior badging; vest; harness; or leash to keep the animal under control during the flight. The passenger simply cradled the dog in her arms during the flight.  As noted in the FA Inflight Manual; SVAN are to remain on leash or harness under passengers control at all times for safety.The main focus of this report is to express extreme concern on how two animals: 1 PETC and 1 SVAN were permitted to board the flight completely undetected by the ZZZ ground staff. Of even greater concern; PETC was in cabin kennel during the boarding process thus clearly visible to agents working the flight. Further; SVAN was permitted in the cabin without the correct restraint thus creating an injury risk to passengers and crew.Report filed due to personal safety/injury risk to passengers/crew with dog permitted to board without proper restraint requirements (leash/harness/vest). It also appears this animal was not correctly documented as a SVAN due to last minute add to PNR.,,,,B737-800 Flight Attendant reported 2 dogs being brought onboard without proper paperwork or notification from the gate agent.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party 1) and ground personnel (Party 2) regarding two passengers boarding a B737-800 aircraft with dogs that were not properly documented or restrained. During boarding, the flight attendant observed a passenger in seat 8C with a pet in a carry-on kennel and another passenger in seat 25A with a small dog under her coat. The first dog remained in the kennel for the entire flight without causing disruptions, but the passenger had to swap seats due to the kennel being blocked by an IFE power box under seat 8C. The second dog, later identified as an emotional support animal (ESA), was not documented as such on the passenger's manifest or special services list. Although the passenger was checked in, there was no reference to the ESA or service animal (SVAN) on the flight attendant's tablet or the special services list. The flight attendant notified the gate agent about the undocumented ESA and observed a customer service representative boarding the aircraft to inquire about the animal. After the flight, it was discovered that the passenger's PNR had been updated to reflect the dog as a SVAN, but the animal was not properly restrained, as required by safety protocols, and lacked any visible identification or control gear. The flight attendant expressed concern over the lack of proper documentation and restraint, which posed a safety risk to passengers and crew. The report was filed to address the safety risk associated with the un restrained animal and the failure to properly document the ESA. The flight attendant recommended improving communication and compliance with documentation and restraint requirements to prevent similar incidents in the future.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and other people"

He had trouble getting bags in bin and slammed bins. He approached fwd galley asking C Flight Attendant for Band-aid with finger bleeding. The OPS agent came to finish up and I asked him what was going on with this passenger. I was told he was okay; they couldn't smell alcohol on him. He was probably tired from being out with business friends during the night. I voiced my concern of his wobbling; and his very slow movements and drifting off. I was told he was fine. The door was closed. During takeoff; he was loud trying to engage passenger in 1-A who feigned sleep. During service; he continually got up for the forward galley restroom but could not find the door; even trying the cockpit door. I stayed in the galley unless he was sleeping during most of the entire flight for security reasons. The B and C flight attendants were made aware of the situation. He continued his lavatory routine many times. At one point; he was returning to his seat and I heard a thud. He had fallen into the bulkhead row and was picking himself getting back to his seat. I asked if he was ok and he at first didn't respond. I asked again and he mumbled yes. I went back to fwd galley and I turned; he was right there backing me up saying he went to the doctor and had taken codeine and I had no right to ask him anything. I explained that I wanted to be sure he had not injured himself with the fall. He returned to his seat. He then shouted that he wanted my name. I stepped to the aisle and stated [my name]. He wanted my last name which I said we do not give out [last names] but [Company] has that info and knows who is working. He was upset. I turned to my galley and he jumped up and came at me with his phone and snapped my picture. I immediately asked him to delete it. He returned to his seat saying NO. I calmly told him that he cannot take a crew members picture without permission and he needed to delete it or have ground personnel meet the plane when we land. He refused. So I clearly stated; you are making the choice to have someone meet the aircraft because you are refusing to delete the picture. He just sat mumbling. The C Flight Attendant had come forward at that time and saw most of this. She then went back to take care of the cabin. I did tell her I was going to inform the Captain and ask for ground assistance. I did call the Captain; however; at that time; they were being diverted due to runway issues in ZZZ so he told me he would get back to me. I stayed in the galley waiting for the Captain to call. I was cleaning up when this passenger; who had been mumbling and talking most of this time; came up at me again; backing me up saying I was going down the wrong path with him. I firmly told him to sit down. The Captain called and informed the crew of the diversion and ZZZ issues. He asked about the passenger situation. I quickly gave a summary and asked for ground assistance. We diverted to ZZZ1. On landing; this passenger jumped up to get his bags saying he was leaving. Ops met the plane and police were quickly there along with ground Supervisor. I gave a statement to police. We received witness names and numbers along with a statement from a passenger who witnessed this passenger in [departure airport] in the gate area. This was given to police.Stop allowing passengers that are clearly under the influence of something to board. I don't know what else to say. These passengers are allowed and enabled. There should be no arguement or debate. If someone is asking if you have been drinking or taking medication; then it's a pretty good bet your behavior brought attention to you. Flight crew DOES look out for these issues. Our FAR states we cannot let them onboard. WE do not! We bring attention to the OPS agent or Supervisor or; our Captains; and then we are continually told 'they are fine' or 'they will sleep' or 'this is the last flight out'. Someone has to stop allowing this. Deny boarding; and stopenabling this behavior. Alcohol related issues are one of the biggest conversations among crew. [The passengers] expect ENDLESS alcohol. Drugs are unseen and are hard to detect but just as dangerous; and then you mix the two. Something has to be done to stop allowing this without there being serious consequences to the passenger! This situation has shown me just how vulnerable we are. I could have been physically hurt. I was trapped by this man. For the entire flight; I was on the highest alert in my head. My anxiety level hit me after we landed back in base. I am still having anxiety each time I have to file a report. My passengers could have been hurt. My Captain was busy with a last minute flight diversion due to runway issues in ZZZ; and had to acknowledge this situation. This puts everyone in harm's way. This man should NEVER have been ALLOWED on this aircraft. One of the witness statements was that he observed this man in [departure airport] and was shocked he was allowed on the aircraft at the very last minute. 74 people were trapped at 35K with him. I am not Management; I do not get to have a say in how our passengers are handled. I only know I; my crew; and the rest of the passengers are put at risk for the sake of ONE individual.,,,,B737-700 Flight Attendant reported a passenger became enough of an issue that police met the aircraft at destination.,"An incident occurred on a B737-700 flight involving a disruptive passenger. The passenger boarded late, exhibited unusual behavior, and was observed struggling with his luggage and appearing fatigued. Despite concerns raised by the flight attendants about his instability, he was allowed to board. During the flight, the passenger displayed erratic behavior, including repeated attempts to locate restrooms and falling in the aisle. He became confrontational with a flight attendant, taking her photo and refusing to delete it, leading to a safety concern. The flight attendant informed the captain, who was managing a runway diversion. Upon landing, the passenger was met by police, and the flight attendant filed a report. A witness statement supported concerns about the passenger's behavior. The incident highlighted the need for stricter boarding procedures to identify and prevent passengers under the influence from flying, emphasizing the importance of denying boarding in such cases to ensure passenger and crew safety.","disruptive, crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and passengers"

We had not yet completed our emergency demonstration when we received the single hi-lo chime from the flight deck that we were being cleared for departure. I knew that our procedure in these short taxis was to do the oxygen demonstration after takeoff. However; the Captain had communicated to us that we were expecting turbulence after takeoff; and that he would call us when it was safe to get up. Because of this; I continued with the emergency PA. I then began my final walkthrough; as it was my understanding that this always needs to be done. I had always seen other A flight attendants complete our pre-takeoff procedures even after we had received the single chime. I had reached the back half of the cabin when we started to accelerate into our takeoff. I was able to quickly get into an open seat and fasten my seatbelt; was not hurt in any way; and I returned to my jumpseat when it was safe to do so. Passengers and my fellow flight attendants saw this happen. Our C Flight Attendant was still in my field of view at the front of the cabin after I took a seat; and she rushed to take her jumpseat after we began accelerating into our takeoff. I debated calling the pilots during cruise to let them know that this had happened; but I was shaken up and upset and decided against it. I did bring it up with him while we deplaned at our destination. He was apologetic; and we both agreed that more communication on both of our parts would have benefited. The crew was not told that we would have a short taxi; and I did not communicate with the pilots that we were not ready to take off after we had received the chime. In my experience; it has always seemed like standard operating procedure for the pilots to wait for the A flight attendant to make the 'cleared for departure' PA before initiating takeoff; and if it is not made; for a call to be made to see what was going on in the cabin. The Captain had told me that ATC chatter had interfered with his ability to hear us making our PAs; and he thought we had made the 'cleared for departure' PA. Our C Attendant did ultimately make it after we were already in the process of taking off; and I was in a passenger seat. I consulted my manual when I got home; and did see where it says to signal the flight deck with 2 chimes and inform the pilots that we had not yet finished our emergency demonstration. Then; finish the oxygen demonstration after take off but below 25;000 ft. Again; that was not an option in this case because it was communicated to us that turbulence was expected on our ascent. Then; the manual says to exercise discretion on conducting the final walk through. I had elected to start my walk through after we had received the single hi-lo chime because I was under the impression that the walk through was always required prior to takeoff; and I do not recall being trained to not do it in any circumstances. Again; I had always finished all surface movement procedures before making the 'cleared for departure' PA; and had seen other A flight attendants do the same; even after receiving a hi-lo chime. And; I had never seen a plane take off without a flight attendant making the 'cleared for departure' PA; which is what happened in this case. Ultimately; this was a learning experience that got me to become more familiar with the manual's details in an unfamiliar situation that I had not yet encountered. In the future; I will communicate with the pilots if we are not ready for departure when we receive a hi-lo chime; and determine what procedures should be completed prior to taking my seat for departure. In my case; it was probably something that needed to happen for me to learn. I did not recall learning to not complete my walk through if we had received a hi-lo chime from the flight deck. If one has never been in a situation like this; the manual's language to 'exercise discretion on conducting the final walk through' does not easily connect to areal world situation where that discretion should be applied. It never would have occurred to me that not 'exercising discretion' could result in me being caught in the middle of the cabin during takeoff. Now that I have referred to the relevant section of the manual after this experience; I am prepared to handle this situation correctly in the future; both through more communication with the flight deck as well as my 'discretion.',,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported not immediately seating after receiving pre-takeoff chime notification.,"The incident involved a miscommunication between the flight attendant and the flight crew. The flight attendant, following standard procedures, began the final walkthrough after receiving the pre-takeoff chime, unaware that the Captain had been unable to hear their safety announcement due to ATC interference. As a result, the flight attendant found themselves in the cabin during takeoff, necessitating them to sit in a passenger seat temporarily. Post-incident, the flight attendant and Captain agreed on the need for improved communication and adherence to procedures. The flight attendant committed to enhancing communication with the flight deck and following manual guidelines more diligently in future situations.","communication issues, operational issues, safety related, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

There was NO PHONE CALL AND NO CHIME OR ANYTHING.. so now safety is involved because if the beverage cart out and being around passengers. I had [the other FA] come back with the cart as quick as she could cause we were closer to landing and when she got back to the front of the plane I had [the other FA] leave the cart in the front and I had told her to take her seat and I will put away the cart as quick as possible. I had a few passengers ask if I needed help but I was not going to put anyones safety in danger due to a pilot error.,,The safety department contacted me to inform me that a communication chime was not received or heard by the flight attendant in the landing phase. This may have led to a situation where a service cart could have been unsecured during landing.The flight was the last of four legs for the flight crew. The transition to this leg was expedited due to some delays impacting the arriving leg. As a result; the flight crew boarded the airplane with the passengers already loaded and the Flight Attendants already onboard. The Captain deliberately stated on multiple occasions to me 'No rush.' To the best of my knowledge; all checklists; SOPs; Chimes; etc. where accomplished completely; deliberately and without rush. To my recollection; the arrival chimes where accomplished; however; there is no aural feedback in the flight deck that I could reference for their accomplishment. To the best of my recollection; an arrival message was given over the PA to the cabin; and all checklists; including chimes; were accomplished per SOP.,,CRJ-900 Flight Attendant and flight crew reported that pre-landing notice was not heard in the cabin and the service cart was not stowed when the landing gear was deployed.,"The incident occurred during the landing phase of a CRJ-900 flight, involving a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and the flight crew (Party2). Party1 reported that they were unaware of the pre-landing chime and had not received a phone call or any notification indicating the deployment of the landing gear. As a result, the beverage cart was still out in the cabin during landing. Party1 instructed another flight attendant to secure the cart as quickly as possible, but due to safety concerns related to the imminent landing, they prioritized securing the cart and ensuring passenger safety. The flight crew, however, maintained that all checklists, including chimes, were completed in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOPs). They emphasized that the arrival chime was broadcasted over the public address (PA) system and that no procedures were rushed despite delays. The incident was reported to the safety department, highlighting a potential communication gap between the flight deck and cabin crew, which could have led to the service cart being unsecured during landing. No specific solution was proposed in the context of the incident.","safety related, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

When the flight deck shuts down the aircraft while we are still deplaning passengers and leaves for their layover; it leaves the cabin crew in an unsafe position due to the inability for us to use the cabin inter phone or PA in the event of any type of emergency in the aft section of the aircraft. In essence; we have no way to communicate with the front of the aircraft other than use of the megaphone. In addition; the cabin temperature rises rapidly once the air flow is discontinued making it a health/safety issue for the 100 or more passengers still waiting to deplane.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft was shut down; on multiple occasions; prior to deplaning all the passengers.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant (Party1) and the Flight Crew/Ground Personnel (Party2) regarding the shutdown of a B737 aircraft during layovers. The Flight Attendant reported that the aircraft was shut down on multiple occasions before all passengers had deplaned, resulting in the cabin crew losing communication capabilities (interphone and PA systems), leaving them reliant on a megaphone. Additionally, the cabin temperature rose rapidly due to the cessation of airflow, posing a health and safety risk to passengers still on board. The Flight Attendant suggested that the aircraft should not be shut down until all passengers have deplaned to address these safety concerns.","safety related, health and medical issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

Subsequently the slide pack dislodged fell part way from door. I grabbed the door to stop further deployment and told agent to back away. I then called captain and told him of situation. He instructed me to get everyone away for safety and came out to assist. He took over my place holding the door and had station personnel call for maintenance. He calmly let passengers know what was happening and remained at door until slide pack was removed to a safe distance and we could deplane passengers.Background of the day and offered as an explanation and not as an excuse; for the fault lies with myself.Several things happened that day to not only distract my focus but also to degrade my physical condition and awareness which led to my subsequent failure.On [a flight] earlier that same day when responding to someone hitting their flight attendant call light repeatedly while I was seated I stood up from jump seat to see what was required. They had turned it off by then and when I went to sit back down in my jump seat it had returned to its spring loaded upright position and instead of sitting in my jump seat I fell to the floor. The rest of the day was filled with discomfort as a result. I tried to fill out an incident report immediately however I was made to understand from the company website that I would need to use an actual computer as the reports were not supported by my handheld device. Dwelling on that and actively trying to physically avoid my number three as he was not feeling well and I didn't want to come down with something as I was already starting to feel unwell. The last few days had included many days of long flight hours and between the physical and mental strain of that and the stress of starting to get sick; I initiated actions that led to the incident.Specifically at the time of the incident I initiated all call procedures to disarm doors and deplane passengers. The flight attendants 2; 3; and 4 all accomplished their disarming per policy. At this time I also realized that the carts needed sealing with blue liquor seals.My door however was still armed. At that point; my number 3 flight attendant pointed to my door and in an attempt to shake me from my non focused state firmly said; 'you need to disarm your door.' I acknowledged him; turned towards my door and immediately gave the thumbs up for the station agent to open door 1L even though it was in the armed position.Between all the issues fighting for my focus at that time; I did not personally use the appropriate disarming procedures including monitor and challenge on my door even after I had crosschecked door 1R.I obviously did not have my focus where it belonged. I was hurting; trying to keep from getting more sick and feeling the effects of fatigue after several long flight hour days. While all of these things are true; the door was opened and slide fell out because I incorrectly initiated the process.I understand the importance of monitor and challenge procedures and I let my pain; distraction and illness take away my focus. The reality of the situation and the danger I put the station agent in is a big reality check that I will not soon forget. My job; when opening or closing a door always involves the monitor and challenge procedures and I intent to always make sure to using them completely to always succeed in my job when opening and closing aircraft doors.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported that the entry door slide was not disarmed when customer service attempted to open the door.,"The incident involved a flight attendant (Party1) and ground personnel (Party2) during aircraft operations. The flight attendant opened the 1L door of a 737 aircraft in the armed position after receiving a thumbs-up signal from the station agent. This caused the slide pack to dislodge and partially deploy. The flight attendant immediately grabbed the door to prevent further deployment, instructed the agent to step back, and informed the captain. The captain assumed control, ensuring passenger safety, communicating the situation to passengers, and coordinating with maintenance. The slide pack was eventually removed, and passengers were safely deplaned. The incident was attributed to the flight attendant's failure to follow proper disarm procedures, including the monitor and challenge protocol, due to physical and mental fatigue, discomfort, and distractions from prior incidents during the day. The flight attendant acknowledged the lapse in focus and expressed intent to adhere strictly to procedures in the future. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further complications.","crew-related issues, emergency, operational issues, health and medical issues, between attendant and other people"

Additionally the passenger reported he saw smoke emanating from the overhead panel in the lavatory. Uncharacteristic of him simply smoking in the lavatory; but possibly something much more serious and potentially life-threatening; an actual aircraft fire. The smoke alarm was activated and projecting an extremely loud and piercing tone throughout the cabin. This caused distress among passengers as well as the FA's. Communicating with the FA's over the interphone was very difficult due to the combined chaotic nature of the alarm and the chaos surrounding its activation. The FA's were having difficulty extinguishing the alarm. I did not know if this was due to continued smoke; or some delay in extinguishing the alarm. Our collective belief was the situation could be much more serious. The FA's asked me for assistance in evaluating the situation. I knew my assistance in the aft of the aircraft would be a departure from our standard protocol. However; based on the information we received at the time; I concluded my assistance might very well mitigate a further degradation in the cabin and secure a safe condition as quickly as possible. The First Officer had demonstrated confidence and technical competence; thus I had no reason to doubt her ability to navigate and control the aircraft; as well as communicate with outside agencies while I assisted the FA's with what appeared and sounded to be a rapidly deteriorating situation. In the interest of time and consequently safety; I elected to personally inspect and evaluate the severity of the incident. I did this in order to determine the most expeditious course of action regarding continuing to [our destination] or turning back.As we were mere minutes from the critical point on our flight plan there was only one FA present in the forward part of the aircraft during the time I exited the flight deck. I shut the flight deck door before the forward FA could enter the flight deck. After working with the FA's to silence the alarm and after inspecting the lavatory and it's overhead panel; I determined there was no immediate threat of an actual aircraft fire; as there was no evidence of heat; burning; or residual smoke. I instructed the FA's to lock the lavatory; and reassess every few minutes. After I returned to the front of the aircraft; I established communication with the First Officer via interphone; and advised her I was ready to return to the flight deck; (after approximately 4-5 minutes). The smoke did not continue; so I opted to continue to [our destination]; as long as the condition didn't reappear. For reasons unknown to me; the First Officer left her seat to open the door rather than pushing the unlock button. About twenty minutes later; the FA's found an electronic cigarette in the toilet that was discarded in what appears to be an attempt to conceal its presence and cause for the smoke. After the passenger (who reported the smoke emanating from the overhead portion of the lavatory) was asked about the device; he did admit it was the cause for the smoke and activation of the smoke detector. I felt in the interest of safety; it was best to leave the flight deck and assess the situation personally; and that would be the most expeditious way to evaluate an overall course of action.At no time during the above events did I intentionally disregard standard procedure; rather I utilized my authority as the Captain to bring the situation to safe conclusion while being mindful of [Company policies].,,,,B737 Captain reported leaving the flight deck to evaluate smoke in the aft lav caused by a passenger's electronic cigarette.,"The incident involved a B737 flight crew responding to smoke in the aft lavatory, which was traced to a passenger's electronic cigarette. Upon notification, the smoke alarm activated, causing cabin chaos. The captain, departing from standard protocol, left the flight deck to personally assess the situation, concluding no immediate fire hazard existed. After extinguishing the alarm and inspecting the lavatory, the captain instructed the flight attendants to lock the lavatory and monitor the situation. Despite the First Officer's departure from standard procedure by opening the flight deck door, the captain returned and decided to continue the flight to the destination. Later, the flight attendants found the electronic cigarette, confirming its role in the incident. The captain's actions prioritized safety, aligning with company policies.","safety related, crew-related issues, emergency, operational issues, fume/smoke incident, electronic cigarettes, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers"

FA (Flight Attendant) X was not in compliance the first day of work. [She] was eating out of first class basket before anyone was served; not briefing the exit row before main cabin door was closed and texting once she finished her service. The second day; FA X was working first class. When we arrived in ZZZ with almost a four hours and a half sit; I arrived in the crew lounge and was watching TV. FA X came in shortly after me [while] I was watching TV and texting. I look up and FA X pulls the plug from the TV and I said to FA X why are you behaving like this?FA X said you are not watching TV and I said I was and did not appreciate her behavior and she said she would do again if I turn the TV back on and she did for a second time. This time ripped it out of the wall and I said to FA X you are being disrespectful and to not do that again. She left the room; came back at the same time another crew member came in the room. She had her phone so loud. FA Y said would you please turn your phone down. She said that the volume was on the lowest setting for her phone. FA Y offered FA X headphones. She said they would not work on her phone. The show FA X was watching was using profanity every other word and it was very loud. Any crew member who walked in immediately walked out and sat outside the crew room. FA Y and myself left the room. We both felt very uncomfortable with FA X's behavior. The crew room is supposed to be a place to rest and relax. I did not feel comfortable with FA X's behavior [and] called my manager and explained what had happened and to see if once we arrived [at our destination;] if another FA could take her place. The manager said I know you have high expectations and informed me this was a CRM [issue] and we needed to work things out. Requested at some point to send an email in regards to what happened. When we arrived in ZZZ1; it was late and I was very tired and had an early report the next day. Did not have time to do a report in regards to the CRM. Following our ZZZ sit; I arrived to the aircraft for our next trip to ZZZ1; FA X said we needed to make it through these next 2 days. She was not sure what came over her in the crew room. I agreed with FA X let's work together. We performed our safety demo and part of the demo was to wear the life vest and performed how to wear the vest. FA X would only hold the vest during our demo. After our demo; I mentioned she needs to wear it versus holding it. On the third day of our first leg; FA X was leaving bins half open and the closet door open. This happened more than 8 times and had requested to please make sure they are closed and locked. She would just look at me and walked away. The service cart was left unattended at the exit row. FA X left her service cart and walk to the front galley and called the flight deck. I saw the cart sitting in the aisle at row 12. We did have turbulence on and off during the flight. I walk back to the cart and checked with passengers for service. She was requesting [that] a passenger wanted to purchase Pringles. Prior to FA X making the call to the flight deck; FA X had touched the FA call button twice in a row and I held my index finger to say give me a minute with okay I will be there. I was in the middle of my service with first class.I was not comfortable and felt the safety on the aircraft for the passengers and myself was not safe and FA X would not comply with the safety of the aircraft. I had requested for a manager to meet the aircraft once we arrived at our destination due to the situation through ACARS.I was not sure what the reason was for her calling the flight deck. I spoke to the flight deck in regards to problems of safety in flight. FA X called the flight deck and said I was ignoring her and not helping her on requested items. I explained as before; I was serving first class and [I] would be there shortly. I said to the CA (Captain) [that]there was a communication problem and FA X was leaving bins opened and unlocked service cart left in the aisle at row 12. FA X walked up to [the] galley to call the flight deck and left the cart in the aisle. I requested the flight deck to please notify ACARS there was an issue with safety on board and FA X was not keeping the bins closed and locked; left her cart at the exit row and not talking to me. After FA X's service in the main cabin; she began texting on her phone for the remainder of the flight and would not respond to me.On arrival; two regional managers came to the aircraft to talk and discuss the issues. I had explained to FA X; once all passengers had left the aircraft; a manager would be coming to talk with us in regards to our flight. Before I could address the reason for the call; FA X started the conversation in regards to the incident in ZZZ crew room and made false accusations in regards to what happened to the point of making up things that did not occur. The main reason for the meeting was to discuss the safety issues. I explained the issues of FA X not listening to my request to please lock and close all bins and several occasions to please close the closet door after she opened it to remove an item. The manager asked if we both could work this flight together if not; and you choose not to; you will have a missed trip and a meeting with a manager. FA X said she was okay and I said I had a problem flying with FA X from inflight safety as well making false accusations that did not occur.,,,,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that the work environment was very stressful due to the cabin crew pairing.,"The incident involved two flight attendants, FA X and FA Y, on a flight operated by an air carrier. FA Y reported that the work environment became increasingly stressful due to FA X's non-compliant and disrespectful behavior. On the first day, FA X violated protocols by eating from the first-class basket before service, failing to brief the exit row, and texting after completing her duties. The following day, during a layover, FA X disrupted the crew lounge by unplugging the TV, leading to a confrontation. FA X's behavior in the crew room was deemed disrespectful and uncomfortable by other crew members, prompting FA Y to contact management and request a replacement. Despite management's suggestion to resolve the CRM issues, FA Y did not file a report due to fatigue. Subsequent days saw continued non-compliance from FA X, including failing to secure bins, leaving the service cart unattended, and making disruptive calls to the flight deck. During turbulence, FA X was observed texting and ignoring safety protocols, leading FA Y to inform the flight deck about safety concerns. Upon arrival, managers met with the crew, where FA X made false accusations. The managers facilitated a discussion, with both agreeing to continue working together, though FA Y expressed ongoing concerns about safety and false allegations. In summary, the incident stemmed from FA X's repeated non-compliance and disrespectful behavior, leading to a CRM breakdown. Management介入 aimed to address the issues, but FA Y's concerns about safety and accuracy highlighted the need for continued attention.","safety related, crew-related issues, disruptive, operational issues, equipment malfunction, training, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

We found someone to interpret; but Ms. X was unresponsive; uncooperative and was unable to understand what was going on. I was flying; so I had the last break; so I (the Captain) went back to see what assistance I could offer. I found Ms. X agitated and not responding to verbal commands. I was advised that she wanted to open the door and get out; she kept telling the interpreter that she wanted to see her daughter 'right now' (the daughter was waiting for Ms. X to connect to another flight; and was going to pick her up). I observed her trying to go for the door; and she became somewhat combative; in addition she began to 'chant' out loud. I talked to the Doctor and Nurse who had offered to help and asked their advice. It was decided that we would let her stand in the aisle way and try and tire herself out (she refused any liquids or medication). I requested an F/A to remain at the door. I didn't want to force her to sit down; and I didn't want to have to restrain her; due to her frail stature and age. I had requested the two pilots in the cockpit to contact Dispatch and advise them of the situation; and our desire to have medical meet the airplane. I discussed the option of diverting with the Doctor and the Nurse; they thought that she could be managed; and that they would keep an eye on her. I elected to continue the flight. I ordered the cabin lights to be turned on in the hope that she would feel a little more secure. I returned to my seat and tried to resume my break. A few minutes later I was advised that she was becoming agitated and aggressive again. I returned to the cabin and after a discussion with the Doctor and Nurse; I ordered her to be put in an aisle with three seats so that the Nurse could sit on one side and the interpreter could sit on the other and keep her secure. It should be noted that by this time she had become a little more familiar with them and was responding somewhat to their voices. She did not want to sit down; so we had to hold her hands down while we physically put her in the seat. This was done with the help of myself; the Doctor; the Nurse; her granddaughter and another F/A. We got her into the seat and buckled her in; while the Nurse and Translator positioned themselves on either side of her. Ms. X calmed down; but did experience a few more episodes of agitation and aggressive behavior. I again questioned them of their ability to keep her calm. If the situation continued; or got worse; I was going to divert and get her off the airplane. They assured me that they could handle her; and there was no further incident for the rest of the trip. When we arrived; the Paramedics were standing by and had to restrain her to get her out of the jet. We thanked all who were involved; and told them how much we appreciated their assistance and consideration. I elected not to call for a Security level 1 or 2; after discussing it with the crew. Ms. X was clearly confused and suffering from Dementia; I did not feel she was a threat to the flight; only to herself. Her agitation and aggressiveness appeared to be due to her confusion and fear; I witnessed no malice or desire for violence. Because of her advance age and frail stature; I saw no real or immediate threat. The event was one of medical nature; and not a security threat.,,,,B777 Captain reported a passenger with dementia and poor eyesight experienced confusion and anxiety on an international oceanic flight. A physician; nurse; and her granddaughter were able to calm her sufficiently to complete the flight successfully.,"The incident occurred on a B777 flight with an elderly passenger, Ms. X, who suffers from dementia and has limited vision. Due to her confusion and anxiety, Ms. X became agitated and unresponsive, expressing a desire to exit the aircraft. The cabin crew, including an interpreter, attempted to assist her, but she remained uncooperative. The Captain intervened, consulted with a physician and nurse on board, and decided to let her stand in the aisle to calm down. When her agitation worsened, the crew helped her sit down with medical assistance, and she was restrained upon landing by paramedics. The flight continued without diversion, as the medical team assured the Captain they could manage the situation. The incident was deemed a medical issue rather than a security threat.","safety related, health and medical issues, between attendant and passengers, crew-related issues"

She had deplaned to retrieve her uncle's medication from the security check point (located in main terminal). We departed; requiring a tram ride from main terminal; where security is located. I was completely unaware a passenger had deplaned during boarding--I was busy doing catering checks; prepping galley; loading ovens; pre-departure beverages; making PA's etc. FA3 was occupied hanging coats and serving the drinks. Boarding was going on this entire time. FA4 stated she believed FA3 and I were aware a PAX had deplaned because boarding was held up briefly for PAX to come forward through First Class to deplane. I was not aware of this; FA2 stated he thought the passenger was coming forward to give a bag to the agent for checking. He stated as the PAX rounded the closet with her bag he proceeded back down the aisle to perform his duties so did not actually see the PAX deplane. Apparently there was an agent at the door but I had zero awareness of any of these goings on. I was task saturated. FA4 states she told PAX to take her carryon baggage and tell the agent what she was doing. Upon my awareness of the incident I spoke to the remainder of her traveling party. My conversation with family confirmed [the] PAX had deplaned with carry on; she had checked luggage; she did not return to aircraft; she returned to main terminal security check point to retrieve [her uncle's] medication kit bag; and she did not make it back to the plane. Family had been in text contact with her and their main concern was how would she get out of ZZZ; what flight would she be on? When asked why they did not notify the cabin crew that PAX had not returned before we left the gate [the uncle] said essentially 'we knew the plane would wait anyway.' I said that may or may not be the case depending on where she was in the process; but we really needed to account for her; for security sake and for her sake and for your peace of mind. They were very kind and calm about the incident; their only concern was how/when [she] would get to [destination].I then briefed the Captain with all I knew of the incident. He was able to contact dispatch and confirm that the PAX was #1 on the Stand By list for [another] flight; with that flight showing 4 open seats at the time. I informed [the uncle]. They continued to text and make positive contact at various times; to include upon landing.Besides the obvious breach in procedure; potential security concerns; and anxiety for the family-the Captain and I became concerned about how many souls we actually had on board. At door close the agent first said 149. Then another agent came back down and said 151; but didn't explain how/why it changed. Then door closed. So now...with PAX deplaning and NOT returning...how many Souls On Board did we really have?In retrospect I recalled an agent stating something to the effect of all the passengers having made it 'except for that one.' I don't know if that is in reference to [the deplaning PAX] or another revenue passenger who didn't make the flight. A 'time-out' to ensure all FAs are aware of what is happening- especially FA1 who is ultimately responsible for ensuring procedure is properly followed. Boarding should have been stopped- FA4 should have escorted the PAX and handed her off to me; or directly to the agent who was standing by; but definitely brief me on the situation. Communication. Slow down. Be deliberate. I feel awful about this event- I feel bad for the family. I am terrified that I let this happen on my watch for the security implication of such an incident. Thankful it had an innocent outcome; but I realize how serious it could be. I have learned a great deal and will include this in my future preflight briefings with my crews. Also; if the plane had crashed...how many pairs of shoes ARE we looking for? That scares me too. I don't know as anyone really knows and am beyond thankful that did not happen. Ask the captain--I was shaken to the core about this for those very reasons and the implications therein. The responsibility weighs heavy and I accept it completely. I feel terrible for what happened and am thankful there were no worse outcomes than some worry and inconvenience for the family. Lesson learned. Thank you.,,,,An Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that she was notified by another Flight Attendant that a passenger did not return to the aircraft after she deplaned during boarding.,"An incident occurred during a flight operation involving two flight attendants (FA1 and FA4) and a passenger who deplaned during boarding but did not return to the aircraft. The passenger had left the aircraft to retrieve her uncle's medication from the security checkpoint in the main terminal. FA1 was unaware of the situation due to being occupied with pre-flight tasks, such as catering checks, galley preparation, and loading ovens. FA3, another flight attendant, believed the passenger was returning a bag to the agent and did not notice her deplaning. FA4 notified FA1 of the incident after the fact. FA1 informed the passenger's family, who confirmed that the passenger had not returned to the aircraft and was at the security checkpoint. The family expressed concern about how the passenger would reach her destination. FA1 briefed the captain, who confirmed that the passenger was on the standby list for another flight with available seats. Despite the resolution, the incident raised concerns about communication protocols, the number of souls on board, and potential security risks. The flight attendant expressed regret for the lapse in procedure and acknowledged the importance of clear communication and halting boarding to ensure all passengers were accounted for. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and adherence to safety protocols among the flight attendant team. The flight attendant committed to incorporating this lesson into future pre-flight briefings and emphasized the importance of ensuring passenger accountability for safety and security.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and passengers"

We called the flight attendants and (in accordance with standard operating procedures) the FO stepped out of the cockpit and a FA came in; closing the cockpit door behind him. While the FO was in the lavatory; a female passenger came up to the forward galley. The FA informed her that she must use one of the lavatories in the back of the aircraft or return to her seat; but that she could not remain in the forward galley. The passenger was Hispanic and claimed not to understand the FA. Luckily; all three of the FAs spoke fluent Spanish and it was again explained in Spanish. The passenger still refused to move and she verbally abused and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA came up to assist. The 'A' FA called up to inform me what was going on. I could hear loud voices over the interphone and the FAs speaking to the passenger in Spanish. Meanwhile; the FO had exited the lavatory and was now also in the galley. After several more minutes; the passenger's husband came up and convinced her to return to her seat. After she was seated and with the three FAs plus the male deadheading FA guarding and blocking access to the forward galley and the cockpit door; the cockpit door was opened and the FA exited the cockpit and the FO entered. We then locked down the cockpit in accordance with a Threat Level 1. I contacted Dispatch with our status and requested to have law enforcement meet the aircraft in ZZZ. After arriving in ZZZ; law enforcement removed the passenger from the aircraft.After speaking with the FO over the interphone; and visually confirming the galley was secure; I determined that it was safer and more prudent to have the FO in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. This scenario needs to be addressed during recurrent security training. What is the safest course of action if the cockpit is locked down with one of the pilots in the cabin? If it is determined that keeping the cockpit on lockdown is the safest course; where should the FA sit? In the jumpseat or in a pilot seat?,The reporter stated that this encounter with a passenger was more of a misunderstanding; but it brought up the bigger issue of what to do if the threat is real. If a real threat was just outside the cockpit door with the first officer out of the cockpit with a single pilot and flight attendant in the cockpit; what is the proper procedure? Do you put the FA in the pilot's seat where they have access to the flight controls; but you can keep an eye on him/her? Do you put the FA in the jumpseat where you can't see them? The reporter mused 'could the FA be in on it'; what is really happening on the other side of the door? The reporter stated that he feels unprepared for which procedure should the pilot use for these type of scenarios. He feels more training should occur addressing these issues.,,,B737-800 Captain reported that a passenger refused to leave the forward galley while the First Officer was using the forward lavatory causing a security issue.,"The incident occurred during the cruise phase of a B737-800 flight about 45 minutes prior to landing at ZZZ. The First Officer (FO) required a physiological break and temporarily left the cockpit to use the forward lavatory. A flight attendant (FA) entered the cockpit in accordance with standard procedures, closing the door behind them. During the FO's absence, a Hispanic passenger approached the forward galley. The FA instructed the passenger to either use one of the rear lavatories or return to her seat, as she was not permitted to remain in the galley. The passenger, who did not understand English, was initially uncooperative. However, the three FAs, who spoke fluent Spanish, repeatedly explained the situation. Despite this, the passenger refused to comply, verbally abused, and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA was called to assist. The 'A' FA informed the Captain via interphone, who heard loud voices and ongoing dialogue between the FAs and the passenger in Spanish. The FO, having exited the lavatory, joined the situation in the galley. After several minutes, the passenger's husband intervened and persuaded her to return to her seat. With the passenger seated and the FAs, including the male deadheading FA, positioned to block access to the forward galley and cockpit door, the cockpit door was opened. The FA exited the cockpit, and the FO returned. The cockpit was then secured in accordance with Threat Level 1 protocols. Upon arrival at ZZZ, law enforcement was summoned to remove the passenger from the aircraft. The Captain, after consulting with the FO and visually confirming the galley's security, determined it was safer for the FO to remain in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. The incident highlighted the need for recurrent security training, particularly addressing scenarios where the cockpit is locked down with one pilot in the cabin. The discussion raised questions about the safest seating arrangement for an FA in such situations—whether in the jumpseat or a pilot seat.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, emergency, fume/smoke incident, disruptive, between attendant and passengers"
1413468,Aircraft X,Flight Deck,Air Carrier,Captain; Pilot Flying,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),,,Training / Qualification; Communication Breakdown,Party1 Flight Crew; Party2 Flight Attendant,1413468,,,,,,,,,,,,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Other / Unknown,,,Person Flight Crew,Aircraft In Service At Gate,General None Reported / Taken,Human Factors; Procedure,Human Factors,The primary concern of this report is the flight attendants not disarming their door after arrival. The signal for the cabin to disarm doors is the seatbelt sign going off. We waited about 45 seconds and they still hadn't started disarming doors. I cycled the seatbelt sign in case they hadn't heard it; still no disarming. As the jet way was quickly approaching the door we made a PA for the flight attendants to disarm doors. This is the same crew who didn't check handset the night before until we had done a [return to the gate] for another reason. The same 'A' that had no idea what a security check was or why we did it on first flight of day. Same flight attendant that had no idea why we wear O2 masks when one of us leaves the flight deck.Maybe we should train the new hires in more than 2 weeks so they learn what we used to teach all flight attendants in their class. This in just one example of the many things I see on a daily basis that hardly ever happened a few years ago The training of the new hire flight attendants is only hitting high spots now train them the way we used to so they actually learn something.,,,,An Airbus A320 Captain reported that after arrival the flight attendants did not disarm the doors in a timely manner.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding the delayed disarm of cabin doors after arrival. The flight attendant failed to disarm the doors promptly after the seatbelt sign was turned off, despite a 45-second wait and an attempt by the captain to cycle the seatbelt sign. When no action was taken, the captain made a passenger address (PA) announcement to urge the flight attendant to disarm the doors. This incident highlighted concerns about the flight attendant's knowledge and training, as they reportedly lacked understanding of basic procedures such as security checks and oxygen mask usage. The flight attendant in question was part of a new hire group that the captain criticized for inadequate training, suggesting that the training program may need to be revised to include more comprehensive instruction. The summary concludes with a call for improved training for new hires to address recurring issues.","between attendant and crew, crew-related issues, training, operational issues"

I was working in A position on the aircraft; a sold out flight with two jump seats occupied. A pre-boarding Customer was listed on my specials report as having a vision impairment and having a working assistance animal. I met the Customer in the jetbridge and offered my assistance; to which he refused. The Customer's service animal appeared to be a full sized golden lab.The Customer proceeded to sit in a bulkhead row aisle seat on this aircraft. I informed the Customer that he would need to sit in the window seat so that his service animal would not hinder the egress of Customers sitting outboard of him. The Customer informed me that he was not going to move to the window seat; that he knew his rights and that he had every right to sit in the aisle seat and that he didn't have to occupy the window seat if he didn't want too. He informed me that his dog was not going to be in the aisle and would not obstruct the aisle. I explained to him that the aisle was not my greatest concern; that the animal was in fact obstructing access to the aisle for the two yet to be occupied seats. The Customer still refused to move. Sensing that the customer was going to be difficult to deal with; I simply replied with; 'Ok' and continued with the boarding process.I pulled out my EFAM (Flight Attendant Manual) and conducted a search to make sure that I was in-line with [Company] policies and procedures. I also asked assistance from my B to help with the search so I could face my customers as they boarded the aircraft. Our search quickly found what we were looking for. [In the FAM] it stipulates that an assistance animal 'May not obstruct an aisle or access to an aisle.'  I informed a ramp agent in the jetbridge that I would need a representative to address the situation and they informed my Ops Agent. I informed my Captain of the situation.Boarding was complete and I still didn't have a representative. Ops Agent again called and Ops Supervisor came to assist. I explained the situation to Ops Sup and Captain and showed them the aforementioned FAM requirements for assistance animals. Captain reviewed the FAM for several minutes to ensure there was no grey area around the policies and procedures. We as a team; all 4 Flight Attendants; our Captain; our Ops Agent and our Ops Supervisor all found ourselves in agreement that the Customer with the assistance animal would need to sit in the window seat in order to meet our safety regulations. Ops Sup was tasked with engaging the Customer with the assistance animal and asking him to swap seats to the window seat. Ops Sup explained everything to the Customer and was rejected just as I was; but this time with all the seats full of Customers; Ops Sup found himself at the end of the stick. Customers who had no reason to be engaged in the conversation with Ops Sup found themselves yelling at Ops Sup; telling him that the disabled Customer had rights and that he didn't have to move if he didn't want too. Ops Sup left the aircraft and made a call to Customer Service to get their stance on the conflict. They backed the direction of the FAM and crew and directed Ops Sup to again ask the Customer with the assistance animal to move one last time or to remove him from the flight for non-compliance with safety regulations. Again; Ops Sup engaged the Customer and the Customer refused to move. He even said that he wasn't getting off the aircraft; period. With that Ops Sup was left with only one option; to call the police and have the Customer physical removed from the aircraft for his refusal to comply with the required safety regulations. After 10 minutes of waiting for the police; Ops Sup called the police again as they still hadn't shown up. The Customers in the row tried repeatedly to get the Customer with the assistance animal to move to the window seat but he refused. Everyonejust wanted to get the flight under way.After nearly 30 minutes the Customer with the assistance animal finally agreed to take the window seat; at the convincing of the Customers in his row. He was angry and told everyone that this was going to be their last day on the job. He stated that he wasn't going to leave the [arrival] airport until he had received justice for the injustices against him. The police never showed up. During the flight the Customer showed no aggression and other than using the forward lavatory three times; stayed in the window seat. He had a Jack and Coke which I comped. Upon arrival; the Ops Agent approached me regarding a known difficult Customer. I gave him the rundown of what happened so that he could alert his leadership team. The Customer and his supporters did in fact give the Customer Service and Ops team a difficult time in the gate area. Leadership informed the Customer that he needed to get in touch with Customer Service.Customers need to abide by the required safety regulations; including Customers with disabilities. Maybe the ACAA (Air Carrier Access Act) could assist the airlines and their members by informing their members of what they can do to avoid conflict on an aircraft and how follow the safety regulations that airlines must enforce. As for flight crews; everyone must be on the same page in enforcing the safety regulations. When one crew lets safety slide; the rest of us hear about it from the Customers.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported an encounter with a visually handicapped; dog-assisted passenger who refused a window seat thus failing to comply with company aisle obstruction regulations. The passenger voluntarily moved to a window seat after a threatened removal from the flight.,"The incident involved a visually impaired passenger with a service dog on a sold-out flight. The flight attendant requested the passenger to move to a window seat to prevent obstruction of aisle access, as per company policies. The passenger refused, citing his rights, leading to a prolonged delay as the crew and supervisors attempted to resolve the issue. The situation escalated when the police were threatened with being called, though they didn't arrive. Eventually, other passengers persuaded the man to move, allowing the flight to proceed. The passenger remained agitated but compliant. Post-landing, he caused a scene, prompting leadership to direct him to contact customer service. The flight attendant suggested that the ACAA could aid in educating passengers to prevent such conflicts, emphasizing the need for consistent enforcement of safety regulations.","safety related, crew-related issues, disruptive, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people"

I made appropriate periodic PAs to Passengers. Our wheels up was :50 so I told Agent and Crew to plan to push at :40. At push time no one was ready. I had to go to the top of the jet way to find the Agent and there was no Pushback Crew. As a result we were rushed despite the 50 minute delay. At this point there was a serious chance that we would not make our wheels up time. At the last moment the A Flight Attendant tossed the napkin on to the console and closed the cockpit door. The last digit of the count was illegible and I made the mistake of assuming it was correct. As we approached the runway we were cleared for immediate takeoff. I rang the cabin to notify the Flight Attendants and as we took the runway the A called up to tell us that there was a Passenger that thought he might be on the wrong aircraft. I had the First Officer instruct everyone to remain seated and that we would sort it out in the air. Above 10;000 feet I confirmed the load sheet count of 46 and compared it to the napkin count of 4 (illegible). I contacted the A who said her count was 47. Further investigation revealed that our extra Passenger was a connect for [a different airport] that had failed to exit at the last stop and remained on the aircraft despite the numerous PAs referring to our destination. I suspect that he was in the lav during the through count process. We coordinated with Dispatch to have a [customer service agent] meet him.Slow down; it's always wise to slow down. Also; our procedure of verifying the count as the very last thing to occur before push; seems like there could be a better time to discover this showstopper; especially when faced with a potentially significant delay if an error is detected. Maybe I haven't been paying attention but I ride other airlines and I've never seen flight attendants actually count Passengers before pushback. The potential error chain has too many links with our system.,,[Report narrative contained no additional information.],,B737NG flight crew reported they departed with an unaccounted passenger onboard.,"The incident arose from a miscount of passengers during the boarding process, resulting in an unaccounted extra passenger on board. The flight experienced a 50-minute gate hold after boarding was complete. Despite periodic passenger announcements, the pushback was delayed due to unprepared staff and missing pushback crew. At pushback, the flight attendant provided an illegible passenger count, leading the captain to assume the count was correct. Takeoff was approved, and the cabin was notified. Shortly after taking the runway, the flight attendant reported a passenger concerned about being on the wrong aircraft. The captain instructed everyone to remain seated and planned to address the issue in flight. Upon reaching 10,000 feet, the load sheet showed 46 passengers, while the flight attendant's count was 47. The discrepancy revealed an extra passenger, a connecting passenger who had not exited at the previous stop, found in the lavatory during the count. The crew coordinated with dispatch to have a customer service agent meet the passenger at the destination. The flight had to divert to resolve the issue, causing delays and operational challenges. The extra passenger was offloaded, and the aircraft was prepared for the next leg. The captain suggested revising the passenger counting procedure, possibly conducting counts earlier or more thoroughly to prevent such errors, noting that other airlines may handle this process differently. This incident highlights the importance of accurate passenger counting and the potential benefits of revising current procedures to minimize errors.","crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people"

I directed the flight deck crew to don oxygen masks and set the regulators to 100 percent and established crew communication. I then [advised] ATC and asked for direct [destination]. Shortly thereafter; the Flight Attendants notified us that the device and its spare batteries (which were also in a state of thermal runaway) were contained in the ion battery emergency containment bag and there was no smoke.The device was apparently an e-cigarette. As the device was contained and there was no smoke; I elected to discontinue the QRH. However; the flight deck crew remained on oxygen for the duration of the approach and landing. Approach and landing were uneventful. My biggest concern is that after attempting to notify the Flight Attendants that we were on oxygen; I never called them back. They were making announcements on my first attempt and I simply dropped calling them back off my to-do list. They were surprised when we landed and were surrounded by Fire Rescue.Distraction management continues to be an issue for all flight crews. As a Check Airman; I should have done a better job of communicating. Better use of all my resources would have kept this from happening. I found myself doing the lion's share of the work in the cockpit when I had a very competent First Officer to help me. Simply dividing a few more of the tasks would have freed up my mind and allowed me to think more clearly.,,,,B737 Captain reported the flight crew donned oxygen masks and asked for direct destination after a Flight Attendant reported smoke in the cabin related to thermal runaway of an e-cigarette battery.,"The incident occurred during the arrival into [destination] when smoke was reported in the cabin due to an e-cigarette battery experiencing thermal runaway. The flight crew donned oxygen masks, communicated with the flight deck team, and requested a direct approach to [destination]. The flight attendants successfully contained the device and its spare batteries in an ion battery emergency containment bag, resolving the smoke issue. Despite the situation being controlled, the flight crew remained on oxygen throughout the approach and landing. Upon landing, the flight crew was surrounded by Fire Rescue, surprising the flight attendants who had been making announcements. The incident highlighted a communication lapse, with the captain failing to follow up with the flight attendants after initially notifying them of the oxygen use. The captain acknowledged the need for better resource management and delegation, recognizing that shared responsibilities could have mitigated the distractions and improved communication.","safety related, crew-related issues, emergency, operational issues, equipment malfunction, fume/smoke incident, lithium batteries, electronic cigarettes, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

At that time the purser opened the cockpit door. I tried to tell her to close the door but she misunderstood me and thought I wanted her to come out of the cockpit. The flight attendant that was guarding the cart was trying to persuade the passenger to go back to his cabin. The purser exited the cockpit and I told her to close the cockpit door. The passenger went back to his seat and I then established contact with the First Officer (FO) via interphone.

While the Captain buzzed the cockpit door, a passenger approached the first-class cart, prompting the purser to open the cockpit door. The Captain instructed the purser to close the door, but she misunderstood and exited the cockpit. Meanwhile, a flight attendant tried to persuade the passenger to return to their seat. After the purser closed the cockpit door, the Captain contacted the First Officer (FO) via interphone. The FO unlocked the door, allowing the Captain and purser to re-enter the cockpit.

The gear dropped and the Captain said 'Prepare for landing.' Yikes! We hadn't gotten the approach announcement. We rushed around; picking up trash and checking seat belts.  Still couldn't see the ground. I saw the ground; we were coming in fast; perhaps 100 feet? Rushed to my jumpseat and made it. Just before landing the lavatory door behind me opens and a passenger is there. I told him to stay in the lavatory for landing; because he couldn't get back to his seat before landing; hold onto the assist handle and brace himself. This was a  passenger sitting in 6C; according to my tablet. The landing was good; the passenger was OK. I called the Captain to ask him to stop for a minute so he could get back to his assigned seat; but the Captain didn't answer. We did stop for a while so I told him to return to his seat.

I checked and none of us said he could - we were landing!The Captain called me back and I told him what had happened and what I had done. After deplaning; the Captain was very apologetic; telling me that Air Traffic Control had changed the runway on them THREE times. I passed on his apology to the crew. Oh; and I think I forgot to dump the coffee before we landed too.  If Air Traffic Control hadn't changed the runway three times; the Captain would have been able to notify us in a timely manner. But...stuff happens.,,,,A321 Flight Attendant reported not receiving the approach announcement from the Captain and only realizing how close to landing when hearing the gear extended. The cabin was not completely secured and a passenger was in the forward lavatory during the landing.,"The incident involved an A321 flight where the flight attendant (Party2) reported not receiving the approach announcement from the flight crew (Party1). This led to the cabin not being fully secured for landing. During the landing, a passenger was found in the forward lavatory, which is against safety protocols. The flight attendant instructed the passenger to stay in the lavatory and brace for landing. After touchdown, the passenger attempted to return to his seat but was initially prevented due to the Captain's unresponsiveness. The flight attendant informed the Captain of the situation, after which the aircraft stopped briefly, allowing the passenger to return to his seat. The Captain later apologized, citing that Air Traffic Control had changed the runway three times, which delayed the timely approach announcement. The passenger was unharmed, and the flight attendant conveyed the Captain's apology to the crew.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, emergency, operational issues, communication issues, disruptive, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers"

You would think exit row passenger of all passenger would be willing and able to comply with crew instructions. This man should never be allowed to sit in an exit seat again! At the time of walk through his seatbelt was undone was under his feet in aisle and newspaper was under his feet. I requested he stow bag and laptop and fasten seatbelt and asked if newspaper was trash could I take it for him. He said no he was reading it so I asked him to remove it from floor in exit row so no one would get hurt if we actually had to use exit; then I continued down aisle. On passing him on my way back he still had not complied with one thing I said. I seriously thought about removing him from exit seat; but did not want to escalate situation. So I made the same request AGAIN. He told me he was keeping his laptop on his lap because he could. I was wrong. I then informed him that I was not wrong and that it was in my manual as such and I would be happy to show him. Finally he said I will put it away but you are wrong and then told to LEAVE HIM ALONE. I talked to the CA of the situation. CA told me to show him in magazine where it is required to stow laptops. I didn't because as I said it would have escalated. This sort of behavior is unacceptable in exit row passenger. This man was of course one of the airline's [high] mile passenger. It is a shame because they hold a status that we cannot do our jobs. Something truly needs to be done. Our hands seemed to be tied and I have a plane full of passenger to protect.

The passenger refused to stow his laptop and remove items from the floor, despite safety instructions. The attendant repeatedly requested compliance but faced defiance. The passenger's status as a high-mileage traveler complicated the situation, as the attendant felt constrained in enforcing regulations. The incident concluded with partial compliance but highlighted the need for consequences to address such defiance.

I noticed that he was consuming alcohol and appeared to be inebriated. His eyes were red and his speech slurry.He had previously told me that he didn't have a card to pay for drinks only cash. He then said that he had paid some passenger to use their cards for his drinks. I slowed down his drinking explaining that we needed to monitor his possible medical situation. He became increasingly agitated and repetitive despite me trying to de-escalate the situation. He was following me around and came into the galley to video me.

They replied back by saying they were supposed to be in Rome flight; that they missed the flight and also was booked in Business Class. Customer mentioned that they already paid Business Class fare and since now is seated in Economy Class; I should not charge for the food. I politely ask for the full name and check my name list. Since the name was not on the list; I explained that I can't compliment a meal. Customer started to complain about how bad Customer Service is and will write me to the company if I charged for the food. I apologize for what happened in earlier flight but I did not have all the information and suggested that they can write feedback to the company online. Customer seems to be more agitated and refused to listen and continue verbal abuse to me; saying that will make a big case about this incident and make sure the social media get my name and the company will fire me. At this moment; I realize that the situation will escalate; so I decided to remove myself from the situation by saying 'Please enjoy your wrap for now and we can have this conversation after the service' and proceed to the next row. Customer now demanded a cheese plate. I told her that I can't compliment for this; and explained even for upgraded customer I can only compliment 1 food item and 1 alcoholic beverage. Customer harassed me again with words; and when I turn away; that's when they grabbed my arm and yanked my sleeve. I told the customer not to touch me. They let go of me and said 'You are very rude. I am not done with you! I want my cheese plate!' They tried to grab me again on my arm but this time I managed to avoid her and I told the customer again for the second time; not to touch me.

The ramp agent was right behind her with the pink sheet. We compared the manifest to the pink sheet and entered the numbers for the solution. We overheard the FA talking with the gate agent about missing 30 people. I asked the agent to come forward and explained to her that it's still 10 minutes before departure time. Please go back up the jetway and make sure there's not a bunch of passengers up there trying to get on the flight. We're not going to leave people behind while the door is still open. As this conversation concluded another FA came forward to share his perception. He stated; quite emphatically; 'there's NO WAY that count is right... there are WAY more than 90 people on this aircraft.' He said he was going to do a head count. I thought that sounded like a good idea. As it turns out there were 127 passengers on board; not 90. I walked up the jetway to talk to the agent and calmly explained to her; 'there is obviously a meaningful discrepancy in the passenger count that will need to be reconciled before departure.' That process took about an hour.The passenger count cannot be trusted at this airport. All flights should require a head count to compare to the passenger manifest.,,,,A320 Captain reported that the passenger manifest was incorrect by over 30 people.,"The incident involved a discrepancy in the passenger manifest for an A320 flight. During the boarding process, the ground personnel noticed that the manifest reported 90 passengers, but the actual number of passengers on the aircraft was 127, a difference of over 30 people. The ground personnel raised concerns with the flight attendant, emphasizing the need to resolve the issue before departure. A head count was conducted at the suggestion of another flight attendant, confirming the discrepancy. The ground personnel then informed the gate agent about the mismatch and suggested implementing a standardized head count procedure for all flights at the airport to prevent similar issues in the future. The resolution process took approximately one hour, and the flight eventually departed after the discrepancy was addressed.","safety related, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and other people"

I made a PA to PAX; asking for volunteers to move. I went to the back of the aircraft to help (FA name) find two seats together. As I was going back up to the front looking for bin space for their carryon bags I saw the FWD entry door closed. The woman with the toddler was standing in the aisle with 3 bags on the floor because we could not get anyone to move. I asked (FA name) why the door was closed. She told me the OPS agent closed the door. I reopened the door as the cabin was not secure. I made another PA asking for people to move. Two PAX were volunteering to move. I was assisting them in moving. When I started towards the front of the aircraft I saw that the forward entry door was again closed. I opened the door again. I then went into the jet way.

I walked onto the threshold of the aircraft with my back facing the FWD entry door and she let the door fall into the cabin. The door was so close it grazed my hair. I went into the cockpit and told the Captain I wanted to speak to a Supervisor. When the Supervisor arrived I told him what happened.

During this time, the ground personnel (OPS agent) repeatedly closed the forward entry door before the cabin was fully secured, disregarding the flight attendant's instructions to wait until all passengers were seated and bags stowed. The OPS agent dismissed the flight attendant's concerns and even shooed her away, causing the door to nearly hit her. The flight attendant reported the incident to the captain, who then summoned a Ground Operations Supervisor. The OPS agent claimed the door closed due to wind, but the flight attendant and another crew member disputed this, stating the door was manually closed.

I attempted to go back to sleep but couldn't due to a galley cart that was parked in front of the door knocking against it every time the aircraft moved from the light turbulence we were experiencing. I got dressed and attempted to exit the bunk but couldn't because of the galley cart parked in front of the door. I waited for the cart to be moved and exited the bunk. The ISM (Inflight Service Manager)/purser and another flight attendant were in the galley. I told them to stop parking carts in front of the bunk door for two reasons; noise from the cart knocking on the door; and we couldn't get out of the bunk in the event of an emergency. [The] flight attendant immediately became argumentative with me. He asked me which manual prevented them from parking a cart in front of the bunk door. He said that it's a galley and that I should expect that kind of noise. He told me to use ear plugs. Here's the best one. He said it's a galley design flaw from Boeing. I gave up after that one. From his argumentative careless attitude towards my concern I was obviously wasting my time trying to fix the problem with this flight attendant. This is a constant issue.In conclusion; I believe that galley carts should not be parked in front of the pilot crew bunk door in the interest of safety. Galley carts banging on the door make sleep impossible and prevent us from exiting the bunk in the event of an emergency.,,,,B787 First Officer reported his rest was interrupted by noises from a galley cart that was parked next to the bunk room door.,"A conflict occurred between a member of the flight crew (Party1) and a flight attendant (Party2) regarding the placement of a galley cart near the pilot crew rest bunk door on a B787 aircraft. The incident was triggered when the flight crew member was unable to sleep due to noise caused by the galley cart colliding with the bunk door during turbulence. Additionally, the cart blocked the exit from the bunk room, raising safety concerns. The flight crew member addressed the issue with the Inflight Service Manager (ISM) and another flight attendant, requesting that galley carts not be parked in front of the bunk door. The flight attendant responded dismissively, challenging the validity of the concern and questioning the relevant procedures. Despite the crew member's efforts to resolve the issue, no agreement was reached, and the problem remained unresolved. In conclusion, the flight crew member emphasized the importance of not parking galley carts in front of the pilot crew bunk door to ensure safety and reduce noise disturbances.","between attendant and crew, safety related, operational issues, crew-related issues"

After 2 minutes; the FA called and reported she was out and feeling better. We asked 'are you sure?' The FA said yes. We taxied; took off; and flew for an hour and 20 minutes without incident. At this time; they called to report our meals were ready. I asked about the ill passenger; and the FA told me there were 20-25 sick people in the back. Vomiting; diarrhea; etc. At this point; we knew we had an issue. We asked them for as much info as possible; if the people knew each other; stayed at the same resort; etc. It was then we learned people boarded the aircraft complaining of illness. This is the first time we heard any of this. I'm truly not trying to throw anyone under the bus; but it was frustrating to find out these details so late in the flight; where we are an hour from the nearest airport with few options. At this point; we requested direct [to destination] and tried to get a patch to MEDLINK. We were on the boundary of HF and VHF; so we never got a clear signal on the VHF frequency they gave us. The FAs came back that 3-4 passengers felt really sick; and the other 20 or so either felt off or had been sick in Puerto Plata. One had even been in the emergency room the night before in the Dominican Republic. Again; news to us. Most or all of the sick passengers stayed at the same resort.

Approximately an hour and 20 minutes into the flight, the crew discovered that many passengers were unwell. With limited communication and options, they requested a direct flight to their destination and CDC evaluation. The flight was diverted, landed visually, and parked offsite for CDC evaluation. After assessing the sickest passengers, the CDC cleared the flight to proceed to the gate.

I start to preflight without putting bags away and I mentioned to the gate agent; if she could please not board without our permission. The gate agent says in front of the line of passengers 'I'm trying to expedite the boarding process on such a short flight since you guys were late'. Our FO (First Officer) then said; 'you cannot board without our permission we have to make sure our safety procedures are done'. The gate agent mumbled to the passengers who could clearly see we were not ready and were very kind to us. After boarding while waiting for the bag slip the other FA (Flight Attendant) made a comment to the gate agent 'that it wasn't very nice to make a comment like that in front of passengers and if she could ask before boarding?' The response was 'good comment; I may take into consideration' and started laughing and walked away to talk with the other gate agent. She had paged us when we were right in front of her and she was aware of us; and started pushing the lady in the wheel chair right behind us as we entered the jet bridge and asked us if we were ready to board when we hadn't gotten on the plane yet. CRM between gate agents and flight crew requires proper communication and respect by the entire team. I would like to add our crew were all on the same page and our FO was respectfully helping us communicate to the gate agent.,,,,Airline Flight Attendant reported having a gate agent commence passenger boarding before the required preflight safety checks were complete.,"The incident occurred during the final flight of a trip, where the inbound flight was delayed, causing the crew and passengers to wait at the gate. The flight crew was preparing for departure when the gate agent prematurely began boarding passengers before the required preflight safety checks were completed. This led to a situation where the flight attendant's bags were blocking the doorway, delaying the preflight procedures. The flight crew communicated their need to complete safety checks, but the gate agent proceeded with boarding, citing the delay as a reason. The flight crew expressed their concerns, emphasizing the necessity of safety protocols. The gate agent's subsequent actions, including making a comment in front of passengers and displaying unprofessional behavior, further strained the situation. The flight crew remained united, with the First Officer facilitating respectful communication. The incident highlighted the need for improved Crew Resource Management (CRM), stressing the importance of effective communication and mutual respect between flight and ground personnel. The boarding process was delayed, and the incident underscored the necessity for better inter-team communication and respect to prevent future occurrences.","safety related, crew-related issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

She said something about a migraine and rode to the airport with her eyes closed. The ride was very long due to rush hour traffic. During the van ride; the other F/A and I were talking and both thought there was no way she could work. When we got to the airport the van driver pulled me aside and told me I needed to do something about her (both that she seemed sick and she smelled sick) the other F/A and I were able to pull the captain aside and share our concerns and the van drivers comments; even telling him that she was not fit to fly. We shared the same concerns with the lead F/A when we got to the airplane. To my knowledge; neither of them spoke to her; and we began to board. We were rushed during the boarding process; even closing the door with bags in the cabin that needed to be checked. After takeoff when the sick F/A came to the back; she went in the lavatory and proceeded to get loudly and violently ill. Myself and the other flight attendant were left to serve and clean up a full 321 by ourselves.I have had some time to think about this; and am extremely disappointed that I feel our concerns about the ability of a crew member to do their duties was virtually ignored. I know we were in an out station; and removing her from the trip would have caused great delays and customer inconvenience; however; that is exactly what should have happened. An ill crew member is often not a very good judge of their own ability and we have an obligation to look out for each other and act in the best interest of our coworkers and passengers. I do not feel I had the tools to do so. We go to great lengths to outline procedures for ill pax; etc. but those were not applied here. We must not fail at our primary duties in order to protect the operation. Without us doing our duties; there is no operation. We need to feel to feel more empowered to do what we know is right.,,,,A321 Flight Attendant reported another Flight Attendant was obviously ill; but worked the flight anyway. This put additional workload on the remaining flight attendants.,"The incident occurred on an A321 flight where a flight attendant, Party 1, arrived late, was not in uniform, and exhibited signs of illness, including a migraine and a strong odor. Despite concerns raised by the other flight attendant and crew about her inability to work, no action was taken to remove her from the flight. During the boarding process, the crew was rushed, and after takeoff, Party 1 became severely ill, vomiting in the cockpit, which increased the workload on the remaining crew. The failure to address the situation led to operational challenges and highlighted the need for crew empowerment to handle such incidents, ensuring both passenger safety and crew well-being are prioritized.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, health and medical issues, between attendant and crew"

He told the passengers that if they wanted to get up and move about the cabin; stretch their legs; use the lavatories; do what they needed to do they could get up. A lot of passengers in the cabin got up out of their seats. Took their luggage out of the overhead bins and used the lavatories. The bins were open the aisle was blocked by bags. I made an announcement to let everyone know they should stay seated if they didn't need to use the lavatories and keep all luggage stowed so when it is time to taxi to the gate [we'll be] ready.Then I called the cockpit and spoke with [the] Captain and told him maybe that wasn't such a good idea. We will need a few minutes to get all passengers seated and make sure the cabin is secure. He said okay. Then 7 minutes later he made an announcement that our gate was open and for everyone to take their seats. We made an announcement for everyone to take their seats. Make sure bags were stowed and setbacks and tray tables were in their upright position. When we were doing our checks the phone chimed.I went to go answer it and when I got to the phone we were already moving. My flying partner told the cockpit we were getting checks done and were almost ready. The Captain's decision and lack of effective CRM resulted in luggage and passengers blocking exits and aisles which would have delayed or prevented an effective evacuation in an emergency.The Captain's decision and lack of CRM also impeded; delayed; and prevented our ability to monitor and ensure a safe cabin during active taxi; a critical phase of flight. The Captain's decision; although fully his; allowed customers to create an environment in direct conflict with FARs; company policy; and established safety practices. The Captain's communication with the crew was condescending; unprofessional; and created a work environment that was unsafe for crew and passengers.,,,,B737-800 Flight Attendant reported being concerned about the safety implications of the Captain's decision to allow passengers in the aisle while they were waiting for a gate.,"The incident occurred on a B737-800 flight when the Captain announced they were landing 10-15 minutes early, allowing passengers to move about the cabin, use the lavatories, and retrieve their luggage. This resulted in blocked aisles and exits due to open overhead bins and loose luggage, creating safety concerns. The flight attendant addressed the issue by asking passengers to remain seated if unnecessary and keep luggage stowed, then informed the Captain of the potential risks. Despite the Captain's agreement, he later instructed passengers to return to their seats, and the attendant continued preparing for taxiing. During this time, the cabin was not properly secured, and the Captain's communication was deemed condescending and unprofessional, contributing to a potentially unsafe environment. The flight attendant expressed concerns about the situation violating safety regulations and company policies. A proposed solution emphasized the need for better CRM and adherence to safety protocols to prevent such incidents.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and passengers"

She is incoherent and mumbling.' I told the Lead Flight Attendant that I intended to call Medlink. She then said that we did not need to do that and she would let me know if things got worse. I repeated that I intended to call Medlink and asked her to find out her name; age and if she had taken any drugs or alcohol. I found the appropriate frequency for AIRINC and had them patch me through to dispatch. I then explained our situation to our dispatcher and requested a patch to Medlink. This communication was very broken. We were dropped a few times and dispatch and Medlink had a hard time understanding us. While I was talking to Medlink I called the Lead Flight Attendant back and attempted to get the information and requested she locate a Medlink checklist that past flight attendants have given to me. She said that the lady was now on oxygen and had taken a Motrin and a glass of wine and would be alright and I did not need to contact Medlink. I told her that I was already talking to them and requested the info I had requested earlier. She then stated that there was a language barrier and she could not understand the woman; but she was doing better. I again asked her if she could find out her name and age. The flight attendant then asked if I wanted her to rummage through the passengers belongings. I said no just do the best you can and ask her. She then said that the passenger just wanted to be left alone and was tired. I again asked her to do the best she could and find out the information that Medlink was requesting. She then said 'Here talk to Flight Attendant B' and would not coordinate with me anymore. This flight attendant gave me the seat number and estimated her age. He stated that the passenger was acting like she was really drunk and about to pass out. I asked him if he smelled alcohol on her and he replied no. I relayed this information to Medlink finally. The Medlink Dr. requested that we have the passenger lay on the floor with her feet up.Upon landing I asked our Lead Flight Attendant to debrief our flight with us as I felt that we had a communication breakdown. She said we did have a communication breakdown because she did not want me to call Medlink and I did anyway. I informed her that my calling of Medlink was not her decision to make and that getting the opinion of a trained doctor was the safest course to take as well as relieving us from liability for not seeking out medical help for a sick person. She stated that she has medical training as a flight attendant and that in the future she will not call the pilots until it is a dire emergency and she wanted us to call for help and we will just be out of the loop. I feel this is an unacceptable and dangerous attitude. Medlink is not just for dire emergencies and waiting until someone becomes very sick could have grave consequences for a sick passenger someday.,,,,B737 Captain was informed by the Lead Flight Attendant that a passenger is down in the aft galley; but it is not necessary to contact Medlink at this time. The Captain disagrees and contacts Medlink; which upsets the lead Flight Attendant.,"During the cruise phase, the Captain was informed by the Lead Flight Attendant of a passenger lying in the aft galley, appearing incoherent. The Captain decided to contact Medlink, despite the Lead's advice to wait. This decision led to a communication breakdown due to poor call quality and language barriers, hindering information exchange. Upon landing, the Captain addressed the communication issues, stressing the importance of consulting Medlink for safety and liability reasons. The Lead Flight Attendant responded by stating her medical training and intent to contact pilots only in emergencies, expressing upset over the situation. The Captain deemed this approach unacceptable, highlighting potential dangers. The incident underscores the tension between the Captain's focus on safety and the Lead Flight Attendant's policy on emergency communication.","between attendant and crew, communication issues, safety related, operational issues, crew-related issues"

When I returned to the Cockpit to start back to my flight Duties; I was informed from the acting Copilot that they had dealt with an unintentional None Crew Person entry into the Cockpit.  Although shocked; after listening to how it had happened I could see how it might have been able to.  The Flight Attendant misunderstood the FO's request to tell his son that they were passing near Greenland for him to take a look.   When I later went back for a washroom break just prior to the landing at ORD; I also talked with the Flight Attendant about his required procedures with the entry into the Cockpit and the Cockpit Door opening. Also reminded him if he ever felt that a request of that nature is what he heard; he best clarify and to just speak up and ask if that was what was asked of him.  Also knowing his responsibilities and training; to just refuse such a request. Had he just asked to clarify; or refused the request none of this would have happened.,,We were at cruise during the second portion of the scheduled pilot break. The Captain was on his break and myself and the relief FO were in the cockpit. As we were approaching Greenland; I called the forward galley to inform Flight Attendant that the weather ahead was nice with good visibility; since he had asked me earlier if we were going to be able to see Greenland. He asked if he could come up to the cockpit. I told him that would be fine; since this would give me an opportunity to take a lavatory break after he came to the cockpit. He said he would call back when the area was clear and he would be ready. The relief FO then called back to the forward flight attendant station and asked whoever it was that answered the phone if they would inform his son who was riding in the cabin that he look outside his window to see Greenland. Subsequently; the Flight Attendant called to say he was ready and would be at the door. I then went to the door and looked out the door viewing port. It was dark outside the door; but I could see his face as he was close to the door. I didn't see anyone else; as the son was much shorter. I then opened the door and stepped back. At that point; the son had already stepped in and the Flight Attendant was following him into the cockpit. As the door was closing behind them; I recalled our security training which emphasized keeping the door open as short a time as possible (three seconds ideally) and realized the safest thing to do was to close the door and sort it out with the cockpit secure. We then called back to confirm the area was still secure and arranged to have them exit the cockpit as quickly as possible. After discussing the error; it appears to have been a misunderstanding about bringing the boy to the cockpit versus pointing out the view.,,A B767 crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit in flight.,"The incident involved an unintended breach of cockpit security on a B767 flight. During the flight, a crew member's child was inadvertently admitted to the cockpit due to a misunderstanding. The relief First Officer (FO) requested the Flight Attendant to inform the child to look out for a view of Greenland. The Flight Attendant misinterpreted this as an invitation for the child to enter the cockpit. Consequently, the child entered the cockpit, followed by the Flight Attendant. Upon realizing the oversight, the FO secured the cockpit and ensured the child and Flight Attendant were promptly escorted out. The situation was resolved without further complications. The Captain later addressed the Flight Attendant, emphasizing the importance of adhering to security protocols and clarifying instructions to prevent such incidents in the future. The Flight Attendant was reminded to refuse or clarify ambiguous requests regarding cockpit access to ensure passenger and crew safety.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, disruptive, between attendant and crew, between attendant and other people"

Whatever training or emphasis Inflight puts on this training isn't working. More times than not the flight deck has to interject themselves into the process to make it work. On this flight three of the four Flight Attendants didn't think a call was necessary. The fourth F/A insisted. She ran the call. It was bad from the start. She didn't inform the A F/A that a medical call was being made. Didn't know where the jacks were; communications were atrocious. At one point when we finally were able to get her to understand she needed to talk to the Dr.; she keyed the MIC and talked for two minutes straight telling the story of the event. It only stopped when the flight deck keyed up the MIC and interrupted her and told her to stop talking. She seemed unable to grasp the difference from information the Dr. would need and completely irrelevant information. This was a non-emergency event by all accounts. The passenger was awake; alert; and said he felt fine after a juice and snack. If it had been critical this could have ended much differently. As it was; I instructed another F/A to take over towards the end. Anecdotally the F/As are not adequately trained to use the headset. They aren't adequately trained to understand the basics of radio communication. They don't talk loud enough. They don't understand the basic information the Dr. will want. They overstate the qualifications of Medical Personnel who are helping. In our case we had a ski resort medic. She repeatedly referred to him as 'Dr'. We are going to hurt someone. This was the worst medical call that I have ever witnessed. It was an embarrassment; and if it had been an actual crisis; a lot of time was wasted. We have to do better.,,,,B737-800 Captain reported the flight attendants did not seem to be adequately trained to properly utilize ground medical resources.,"The incident involved a flight attendant initiating a ground medical call that was poorly executed due to inadequate training. The attendant failed to communicate effectively, providing unnecessary details and incorrectly referring to a medical responder as a doctor. The situation was non-emergency, with the passenger recovering quickly, but highlighted significant training gaps. The result was a ineffective communication that wasted time and could have been critical in an emergency. The solution proposed is enhanced training for flight attendants in medical communication and procedures.","safety related, operational issues, training, communication issues, between attendant and other people"
1349852,Aircraft X,Flight Deck,Air Carrier,First Officer; Pilot Not Flying,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,Party1 Flight Attendant; Party2 Flight Crew,1349852,,,,,,,,,,,,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Security; Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Passenger Misconduct,,Y,Person Flight Attendant,In-flight,General Police / Security Involved,Human Factors,Human Factors,I (First Officer) was pilot monitoring on approach at about 700 feet AGL into LAX on 25L. I could hear through my headset and the flight deck door some sort of commotion that sounded like voices. I thought it was slightly unusual; but we were close to landing; [and] I wasn't sure if the flight attendants were simply doing their last minute duties before landing. On the landing rollout turn onto a high speed taxiway; we got a call from the flight attendants. My Captain and I recognized it and both agreed we were going to address it as soon as we completed our after landing duties since we were still slowing down and in a very high workload environment between the normal flows; checklist; and call to ops. Before we could complete our after landing flows; however; the flight attendants then called using the 'emergency' call button. The Captain immediately stopped the plane and informed ATC while I talked to the flight attendants. The flight attendants told us we had a belligerent passenger; who had taken her seat belt off during approach and was walking around the cabin. I relayed this information to the Captain. We tried to ascertain what the current status of the passenger was to determine if she was still a threat. The flight attendants said she had returned to her seat with her seat belt fastened. Following the Captain's direction; I asked the flight attendant if they thought we needed a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) to meet us at the gate; since the information we were getting appeared to indicate that the passenger had returned to her seat and fastened her seat belt and was complying. After a pause and the flight attendant's clear hesitation on making this decision; I suggested that we'd have a LEO meet us at the gate; which the flight attendants agreed was a good decision. I called ops; and worked through arranging a LEO to meet us at the gate. Unfortunately; in the chaos ops didn't know we were on the ground in LAX because our ACARS had failed midair on that leg. This resulted in some delay getting the ground crew to the gate to marshal us in and then waiting for the LEO to meet us at the gate after we had parked. We delayed deplaning the aircraft until the LEO could escort the passenger off the plane.I saw the passenger briefly in the jet bridge hitting the LEO while the LEO explained to her that she would be arrested [if] she didn't stop. I left to do my walk around; and when I returned; I saw her being carried away in handcuffs by two LEOs up the jet bridge.As the incident occurred we were informed that it was alcohol-related; and the passenger was clearly intoxicated. She had been served two alcoholic beverages during the flight; and according to the flight attendants; was perfectly normal after 1; but the second resulted in her belligerent behavior.Passengers being disruptive are a part of air travel; but there were a few lessons I learned to help make it smoother with less operational disruptions. First; explain to the flight attendants that they should let us know quickly if there's a potential problem. On final approach; one of us could conceivably have answered a call early on knowing there was simply an issue with a passenger. Then we could have called back when we had finished our initial after landing duties and better managed the workload.While the Captain and I performed great CRM during the whole event (clearly dividing who was doing what - Captain did taxiing and communicating with ATC while I talked with the flight attendants and coordinated with ops); things changed when our first form of communication with the flight attendants was after they had pushed the emergency call button. The Captain and I both feared when we saw that light go on that we might have been on fire or some other emergency requiring evacuation onto the taxiway. The Captain later informed the flight attendants that we were going to get to the situation as quickly as it was safe to do so; but the emergency callbutton might not have been necessary since at the time they called the passenger was in her seat with her seat belt fastened.Finally; I believe one of the important things for the flight attendants to learn is how much we pilots rely on them to paint a picture of what is happening in the cabin in a situation like this. Initially when they called up; it sounded like it was a minor issue that was under control and wouldn't require any special assistance; and it took a long time to come to the conclusion to pull the trigger on having security meet us at the gate. When we exited the flight deck at the gate; the Captain and I agreed that there was no doubt we needed security to meet us (and the Captain commented that if she'd been displaying that behavior when she boarded the flight; she would have still been in [departure airport] at the gate); as even though she was in her seat; she still was not complying with instructions and posing a threat to those around her (as evidenced by her repeatedly hitting the calm LEO while in the jet bridge). Having gotten this information better communicated to us would have allowed us to get to the gate quicker since we were stopped on the taxiway during the whole conversation with the flight attendants. While in this incident it did not make a difference; a different situation might result in a passenger being more physically aggressive; making a quick decision allow for a sooner end to the scenario with less damage or injury to passengers and crew. And while not as important; a quicker decision would have also mitigated some of the delay that this incident caused to the remaining flights of the day.,,,,Air Carrier First Officer reported that an unruly passenger disrupted the cabin shortly before landing.,"During a flight approaching Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), a passenger became unruly and disruptive after consuming two alcoholic beverages. The passenger removed her seatbelt during the approach, walked around the cabin, and refused to comply with crew instructions, despite returning to her seat and fastening her seatbelt. The flight attendants initially contacted the flight deck, reporting the situation. When the passenger's behavior continued to escalate, the flight attendants activated the emergency call button, prompting the flight crew to stop the aircraft and coordinate with air traffic control (ATC) and ground operations. The flight crew, with the assistance of law enforcement, delayed deplaning until the passenger could be escorted off the aircraft. The passenger was eventually removed by security after becoming physically aggressive with the law enforcement officer. The incident was attributed to alcohol-related behavior and resulted in delays due to communication challenges, as the aircraft's ACARS system had failed, complicating coordination with ground staff. The flight crew emphasized the importance of clear and timely communication from the flight attendants regarding potential cabin issues. They suggested that earlier notification of the situation could have allowed for better management of workload and a smoother response. Additionally, the flight crew highlighted the need for flight attendants to provide a more detailed account of cabin events to help pilots assess the situation accurately and make informed decisions.","between attendant and passengers, disruptive, communication issues, emergency"

None of them spoke English; making communication very difficult. The mother was seated next to one of the boys with the girl and a boy behind her and one boy in front of her. The girl appeared to be the youngest and was about 3 or 4 years old. When we secured the cabin before door closure they were all in their seat belts; but after we closed the MCD (Main Cabin Door) and started the safety pre-departure announcement and demo; the little girl got out of her seat and stood next to her mother. The mother made no effort to get her child back in her seat. We stopped the demo and I managed to get her back in her seat belt and tried to indicate to her brother that she needed to stay there. We finished the demo; secured the cabin and taxied out to the runway. We were in line to take off and were expecting our takeoff chime when the little girl got up again. This time the mother picked her up and put her on her lap. Even though she appeared to be over two years of age; I felt that getting up to rectify the situation at that phase of the flight was not safe as it would take some time to get her settled again and decided to leave the child held on her mother's lap for takeoff. As soon as it was safe for us to get up; I went back to the mother and decided to rearrange the children to try to avoid a repeat incident. I tried to indicate that the little boy sitting next to her should go to the row behind and that she should strap the little girl into the seat next to her. There was very little cooperation from any of them; including the mother; but I finally got the little boy strapped into the seat one row back and the little girl seated next to her mother and in her seat belt. She fell asleep and stayed there for the rest of the flight.There was a big language barrier and complete lack of understanding of airplane safety and regulations. They not only did not speak English; but hardly spoke at all (even to each other). The family boarded last and had been escorted out to the plane; presumably so that they would know where to go. I did not realize until after we closed the door that none of the family spoke English and there was no information on the paperwork. When the little girl got up the first time; during the demo; I alerted the flight deck that we might have a problem with an unsecured child over two years old. When I got her seated; the CA (Captain) said that if she was secured; we were going to go. I thought that I had succeeded in making someone in the family understand that she needed to be in her seat belt and that she wouldn't get up again; so we proceeded to taxi out and get in line for takeoff.,,[Report narrative contained no additional information.],,Air carrier Flight Attendants reported having difficulty getting a non-English speaking family to understand and comply with safety procedures and regulations.,"The incident involved a language barrier and lack of understanding of airplane safety regulations by a non-English speaking family consisting of a mother and four young children (three boys and one girl). During the pre-departure safety demonstration, the youngest child repeatedly left her seat, and the mother failed to ensure compliance with safety protocols. The flight attendant intervened, securing the child initially but facing resistance when attempting to rearrange the seating during takeoff. Due to safety concerns and time constraints, the flight attendant allowed the mother to hold the child during takeoff. Post-takeoff, the flight attendant successfully rearranged the children, securing the youngest girl in her seat. The language barrier and lack of cooperation from the family posed significant challenges, but the flight attendant managed the situation to ensure a safe flight. The proposed solution involved persistent communication and adjustments to seating arrangements to prevent further incidents.","safety related, passenger-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and passengers"

Several passengers at mid cabin and aft cabin were non-compliant of takeoff instructions and the D and B FA were addressing the issue. Securing the cabin was taking a little longer than normal due to non-compliant passengers. Pilots signaled the cleared for takeoff ding. The 'A' flight attendant did not answer and confirm with pilots that cabin was secured due to the fact that flight attendants were still addressing non-compliant passengers. 'A' flight attendant observed aircraft taxi onto runway and immediately went into take off phase. 'A' flight attendant immediately made pa announcement to all flight attendants to take their seats and secure themselves. 'A' flight attendant was not able to notify the Captain in time to delay take off due to sterile flight deck. Captain did not ask for verbal confirmation if cabin and flight attendants were secured. When we landed and Captain was informed of what happen; there was no concern or remorse from his part and when asked why did he takeoff without confirming cleared for takeoff signal from the 'A' flight attendant his response was 'I heard talk so I assumed you were secured.' I feel there was a breakdown in communication between pilots and flight attendants.Breakdown in communication occurred between the pilots and flight attendants and needs to be addressed. A more paced taxi should take place to allow flight attendants enough time to secure the cabin; galleys and themselves in jump seats including performing the emergency demo on a very short taxi especially at smaller airports. And finally we should possibly add to the present response we have in place to the pilots [something to the effect of reminding passengers to check your seat belts and that the cabin and flight attendants are secure.],,,,B737 Flight Attendant reported a takeoff before the cabin was secured due to some noncompliant passengers and no communication with the flight crew.,"The incident occurred on a B737 flight during which non-compliant passengers delayed the cabin securing process, as the flight attendants were occupied with addressing their behavior. When the pilots signaled clearance for takeoff, the 'A' flight attendant, unable to confirm with the captain due to a sterile flight deck, initiated takeoff without confirmation. After landing, the captain's assumption that the cabin was secure based on hearing passenger conversation highlighted a communication breakdown. The flight attendant suggested solutions: allowing more taxi time for cabin securing, adding passenger reminders, and enhancing communication between flight crew and attendants to prevent future incidents.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, communication issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers"

As I was contemplating asking if he needed to use his concentrator during all phases of the flight; I checked my manifest and noticed he wasn't even listed as having an O2 concentrator. As I was about to ask him a question or two; the passenger in 13B asked me if his (12B) O2 bottle ran out; would we have O2 bottles for him to use on board. I almost chuckled as I said 'he's not using O2 from a bottle; it's an O2 concentrator; but we have no info about it even being on board.' She replied that he indeed was using an O2 bottle as he has lung cancer and only 25% use of one of his lungs. I must have had a very odd look on my face as I said 'but he can't bring his own O2 bottle on board an aircraft; totally not allowed!' 'How did you get past the TSA?' She said they discovered the bottle; took it; checked it out; and returned it saying it was okay. My comment was 'they what?' 'So; no one else was informed that you had this and intended to use it on the plane? Turn it off please; now.' I went and retrieved one of our Portable Oxygen Bottles (POBs) and asked the D flight attendant to tell the A flight attendant to notify the flight deck. The passenger in 13B was the girlfriend of the passenger in 12B. She also told me he has used his own POB on many other flights before. She didn't say which airline.Being the C flight attendant; I'm not allowed to be forward of the exit rows for boarding; nor would I leave my cabin area of responsibility prior to takeoff. After takeoff; I'm setting up my cart as the B and D flight attendants are [completing other service duties]. So; not sure how I could have done anything different due to my position. Had I been working a position where I would have seen Mr. [12 B] on what I would have assumed was an O2 concentrator; I would have looked at my manifest to see if he was listed as using one. I would have then asked him if he needed to use it during all phases of flight including takeoff and landing; where I may have asked to move him to a window seat so as not to block/hamper other passengers egress to the main aisle in an emergency. That exchange most likely would have brought about a discovery of an O2 bottle and not a concentrator.I think lesson #1 is never assume a darn thing! Many passengers are not aware they need to disclose plans to use an O2 concentrator and I have watched them come onboard only to discover they aren't listed on my manifest. I then have time to contact an agent to see if they are aware of it and it just hasn't showed up on my manifest yet. I strongly suggest all flight attendants be very aware of passengers using O2 and watch for the device when passengers are boarding; then verify we all know about it. None of that would have mattered in this instance as his O2 bottle was concealed in a small black oblong bag. Boarding an aircraft is a crazy busy time for all concerned. All the more reason to be alert then; as well as any time after takeoff; to things like a passengers using (what should only be) an O2 concentrator and checking to make sure they are listed in our manifest or the proper tag has been placed on it by our agents.,,,,Flight Attendant reported discovering a lung cancer patient inhaling oxygen from a personal bottle not listed on the manifest. The bottle was turned off and replaced with an onboard bottle.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a passenger in seat 12B, diagnosed with lung cancer, used a personal oxygen bottle not listed on the manifest. The flight attendant, initially unaware, was informed by the passenger's girlfriend that TSA had permitted the bottle. Upon realizing the bottle's presence, the flight attendant retrieved an onboard portable oxygen bottle, instructed the passenger to turn off his personal device, and notified the cockpit. The flight attendant emphasized the importance of verifying oxygen device usage and being vigilant during boarding to prevent similar occurrences. The result was the passenger switching to the provided onboard bottle.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, emergency, operational issues, training, communication issues, disruptive, health and medical issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people"

The APU was not yet on the bus and I shut down the number two engine. We then proceeded to the gate without any communication from the Flight Attendants that there was a problem. As the Passengers were getting off of the airplane; Flight Attendant; advised us that the Flight Attendants believed they heard a ding and believed we were at the gate when we were still on the taxiway. They let the Passengers up and cracked open the doors. Once we began to taxi; the Flight Attendants immediately closed the doors and seated the Passengers. The Flight Attendants did not advise us of the situation until we were at the gate. We did not turn the seatbelt sign off until we were at the gate with both engines shutdown.Better communication between the Flight Attendants and Pilots.  The First Officer cancelled the door open master caution without advising me just after I shut down the number two engine. Pilots could have briefed the Passengers when we were momentarily delayed.,,[Report narrative contained no additional information].,,A B737 flight attendant crew heard a 'DING' after the aircraft stopped taxiing and thought the aircraft was at the gate. They allowed passengers up and opened the doors. However; the Captain had only stopped to give way to another aircraft and shut down an engine which caused the electrical power shift to make a 'DING' sound in the cabin. They then taxied to the gate.,"An incident occurred during a B737 flight when a flight attendant crew misheard a cabin ""ding"" sound following the aircraft's temporary stop on Taxiway Delta. The flight attendants believed the aircraft had reached the gate and permitted passengers to deboard and doors to open. However, the Captain had stopped momentarily to yield to another aircraft and had shut down the number two engine, causing an electrical power shift that produced the ""ding"" sound. The flight attendants did not communicate their actions to the flight crew until the aircraft reached the gate. As a result, the aircraft had to taxi to the gate with passengers reseated after the doors were closed. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication between the flight crew and flight attendants. A proposed solution included the First Officer informing the Captain before canceling the door open master caution and the Captain briefing passengers during delays.","communication issues, operational issues, safety related, between attendant and crew"

Upon check in; asked the Customer Service (CS) agent if there were any Specials (ie. FAMs; WCHRs; LEOs etc); he replied no. Boarding started with First Class; when a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) presented his paperwork to me in the First Class galley. Since the Pilots had not yet arrived; I got his info; advised him to take a seat and when the First Officers (FO) arrived I would advise. Soon after; one of the First Class passengers that had already boarded motioned me to the galley. Turns out he was a Federal Air Marshal (FAM); he presented and I verified credentials; and he was wanting to know where the LEO was seated. When the FOs boarded; they didn't know about the FAMs and LEO either. When the CS agent came down with the final paperwork; I asked him to the galley (out of passenger view) and told him that we as a crew need to know these in advance. This information was available when we checked in; so why wasn't it given to us then? His reply was; To tell us about these armed passengers would compromise security; and if I really need to know; it's all on the FINAL paperwork.,,,,A B737 Purser reported the gate agent refused to tell her where the Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) and Federal Air Marshal (FAM) were seated on their aircraft because to do so would be a security breach.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Purser) and ground personnel (Customer Service agent) regarding the disclosure of information about a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) and a Federal Air Marshal (FAM) on board a flight. The Purser, while boarding First Class passengers, encountered the LEO and later a FAM, both of whom required specific seating arrangements. The Purser sought to verify their credentials and seating locations but was informed by the Customer Service agent that such information could compromise security and was only available on the final paperwork. The Purser expressed frustration over the lack of advance communication, as this information is typically provided upon check-in. The Customer Service agent maintained that revealing the details would breach security protocols. No solution was explicitly proposed in the context, but the Purser emphasized the importance of timely information for crew safety and management.","between attendant and other people, safety related, operational issues, communication issues"

My first officer and I also discussed the likely possibility of a fuel spill somewhere near us on the ramp. In my experience on the MD-80 it is not uncommon to get a faint; exhaust like fume smell in the air conditioning system; and thick condensation during hot; muggy summer nights such as this one was in ZZZ. I assume the smell was stronger in the cabin than in the cockpit since both the FO and I had our air vents closed. The flight attendants requested that I make a PA stating that everything was ok and there was no cause for alarm and we are aware of the condensation and smell; which I did. The two forward flight attendants also informed me that 'they opened the doors in back' which I thought meant that the two rear flight attendants had opened the rear aircraft doors for ventilation. Our number three and one FAs; meant to inform me that passengers were exiting through the over wing exits. This was a simple misunderstanding that was caused by task saturation in the cockpit; monitoring the APU indications; and determining the cause of the smell. I was later informed that passengers took it upon themselves to open all four over wing exits and exit onto the wing. I was told that it was estimated that 15-20 people were on each wing at one point. Our number two flight attendant vocally told passengers to stop exiting through the over wing exits. The FA had no chance to prevent passengers from initiating the uncommanded evacuation given the crowded aisle and interior that is typical of everyone standing when the seat belt sign is turned off. Our number four flight attendant made a PA instructing passengers to stop and to not evacuate or exit though the over wing exits. I did not hear this PA. The FO and I opened our air vents and the fuel odor got stronger and the condensation thickened. I then shut off the Ram Air; APU AIR switch; and both packs; which caused the fuel smell to lessen considerably in intensity and the condensation stopped completely. A man who works the ramp came up to the cockpit and told us we had fuel leaking out of the APU. I then told him to connect external power and I began to shut down the APU. I also told the first officer to go outside and inspect the APU fuel leak with the ops personnel. We informed ground of the fuel leak and we requested ARFF to come inspect the area as a precaution; which they did. I was told by the gate agent that only one person had jumped off the left wing. I was told by operations and my flight attendants that a few passengers came back into the airplane through the over wing doors; and the rest exited the wings on baggage belt loaders. There were no injuries that I know of. This was confirmed by all four flight attendants and ZZZ operations personnel. Upon inspection of the APU; fuel was in fact leaking out of the non-ram door area and the fuel spill was about fifteen feet in diameter. I was instructed by maintenance to pull 5 circuit breakers; which I did; secured the airplane with the securing check; and made the appropriate entries in the maintenance logbook.,,,,A fuel odor; later identified as an APU fuel issue; was detected as passengers began to deplane at the gate. A partial; uncommanded; evacuation was initiated by several passengers via the over wing exits. No injuries were reported.,"The incident occurred after a flight arrived at Airport ZZZ and completed its parking checklist. Upon opening the L1 door, the flight crew and forward flight attendants detected a faint fuel smell, which they initially attributed to external factors such as a neighboring aircraft being fueled, the APU running, and gusty northwest winds. The flight attendants requested the cockpit to make a passenger address (PA) to reassure passengers, which was done. However, there was a misunderstanding regarding the status of the aircraft doors and exits. Passengers, believing there was an emergency, opened the over wing exits and began exiting onto the wings without authorization. Despite efforts by the flight attendants to stop the uncommanded evacuation, several passengers exited before being directed back into the aircraft. The fuel smell intensified, leading the flight crew to shut off the APU and air conditioning systems, which reduced the odor and condensation. A ground staff member informed the cockpit of a fuel leak near the APU, prompting the crew to secure the aircraft, shut down the APU, and request ARFF (Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting) support as a precaution. Maintenance personnel inspected the APU and identified a fuel leak. The crew secured the aircraft, performed the necessary checks, and documented the issue in the maintenance logbook. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without further incident. The cause of the fuel odor was later identified as a fuel leak from the APU, which was addressed by maintenance.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, fume/smoke incident, between attendant and passengers"

I immediately noticed [female passenger's] head was wrapped in surgical bandages and her face was very swollen.  Her face was so swollen; her eyes were slits. On the left side of her face was a lump about the size of an orange.  Out of concern; I greeted [her] and asked where she was sitting; my motivation being to keep an eye on her during the flight.  [Male companion] showed me his wife's ticket; 21E; an exit row seat.  I asked [female passenger] if she knew she was assigned to an exit row seat.  She did not respond and just stared at me with dull; listless eyes.  I thought she might be on some kind of pain medication as a result of her obvious medical condition.  I asked [her] if she was capable of opening an exit window and assisting in the event of an emergency.  She continued to stare blankly at me and not answer my questions.  [Male companion]; speaking for his wife; said 'of course she can!'  He told me that the gate agent assigned us these seats.  Purser witnessed [female passenger's] condition; my asking her emergency exit questions; [her] not responding and her husband responding for her.  When I told [male companion] we would need to relocate them to another economy plus seat; [he] indicated he was unwilling to have their seats changed.  At that point; [the Purser] went to find a CSR to handle the situation.The [passengers] took their seats at the exit row.  Boarding continued and my attention was soon diverted from boarding to a CSR speaking loudly to [the Purser] near me in the First Class galley.  He was challenging her judgement about [female passenger's] condition and he did not want to move the [passengers].  I offered CSR my assessment of [female passenger]; saying I believed she was not qualified or capable of assisting in an evacuation. I told him that she did not respond to my exit row verification questions and that I thought she might be on some kind of medication that would also inhibit her ability to assist. CSR was visibly not calm or controlled.  His voice was loud and he appeared to be taking our request to relocate the [passengers] out of the exit row personally.  [He] snapped back at me 'did you ask her if she was on medication?'  I replied the husband was insisting he and his wife not be moved and because the door was still open; it was not my responsibility to ask any passenger if they are on medication.  [CSR] left the plane saying he was calling his supervisor.  [Purser] went to the cockpit to inform the Captain about the problem.  The Captain supported our concern and put in his request that Customer Service reseat the [passengers]. The Captain was on the jet bridge; talking to the Customer Service supervisor and CSR. Another gate agent reseated the [passengers].  The door was closed and we took off.  Within minutes of wheels up and before the inflight announcements were made; we heard the call chime. I could see the light was near the [particular passengers] so I made my way toward the call light to where they were sitting.  [The female passenger] was unconscious; shaking and being held by her husband.  I went forward and immediately notified [Purser].  We had an emergency room doctor in 2A and he immediately responded.  [Purser] notified the cockpit and served as communicator while I assisted the doctor.  Another doctor and a surgical nurse were across the aisle from the [passengers] and they both assisted the emergency room doctor.  It was determined by the doctors that [the female passenger] had suffered a seizure and possibly a post-op blood clot to the brain or stroke.  The doctors agreed an emergency divert was necessary.  We landed in Airport ZZZ where [the female passenger] was removed by EMT.,,During boarding; I noticed a couple seated in the exit row at 21 E and F. The woman had a heavily bandaged head and her eyes did not seem to focus completely (as though she was on medication). They both had carry-on items and 2 large bed pillows at their feet; blocking access to the window exit. When I attempted to explain that the items had to be stowed; the man interrupted me and said; 'She can do it' apparently referring to her ability to open the window exit in an emergency. My flying partner indicated that they were being moved to other seats. I was very surprised to see that they had been seated in the emergency exit row to begin with and said the same to our purser; who had already brought the issue up with the CSR working the flight. As it turned out; the woman had a medical event during the flight and the plane was diverted to Airport ZZZ; where she was removed from the flight and taken to the hospital.,,Two flight attendants requested that passengers be relocated from exit row seating due to concern over the female passengers state of health. Customer Service was resistant but eventually reseated the passengers. Shortly after takeoff; the female passenger was reported to have become unconscious. A medical diversion took place where the passenger was removed from the flight.,"The incident originated from concerns raised by the flight attendant regarding a female passenger's medical condition, which included bandaged head injuries, facial swelling, and possible medication use. The passenger's husband insisted she could perform emergency exit duties, despite her unresponsive nature to relevant questions. The flight attendant sought to reseat the passenger from an exit row due to her medical state. The Customer Service Representative (CSR) initially resisted this request. After consultation with the purser and supervisor, the passengers were reseated. Post-takeoff, the female passenger experienced a medical emergency, leading to an in-flight call for medical assistance. An emergency room doctor and other medical personnel assessed her condition, diagnosed a possible seizure or clot, and recommended a diversion. The flight was diverted to Airport ZZZ, where the passenger was removed by EMTs and taken to the hospital. The flight resumed its journey after the incident was resolved.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, emergency, operational issues, health and medical issues, between attendant and passengers"

I couldn't imagine starting off a flight any better. I ask my First officers (FO) what their plans were for meal service and then shared this with both Purser and the galley person so as have a plan and to work out reasonable expectations. The Relief Pilot did not want to eat until after the first break. Both the First Officer and I said 'if you have our snacks or cold breakfast we will take that now so as to unburden you until after the passenger meal service is complete. Unfortunately only the hot meals were aboard so we all agreed that 45 minute after takeoff (ATO) our food would be put in the oven to be eaten at XA:15 ATO. This is my typical communication while finding the right balance and compromise to promote a positive working together atmosphere. Forty-five minutes after takeoff; I called and verified the meals were being heated and he said yes. (XA:30 ATO) about forty-five minutes after the meals being heated I needed to use the rest room and thought this was a good time since the meals should have been ready 15 minutes ago. This would also minimize the cockpit door from being opened and also reduce disturbing the passenger service flow. During this door opening the galley person seemed just a little off and spoke almost too quick to understand and said something about our meals and that he put the wrong ones in but that he had them in now and they needed another seven minutes; I said cool; no worries and the door closed.(XB:15 ATO) Another forty-five minutes goes by and we still have no meals.(XB:45 ATO) I called the galley person and asked about the meals and he said 'we would get them when he was finished with his service' with a firm no-option tone.I immediately called the Purser and informed him the situation and we needed to get our food and was looking for assistance and support from him. It was at this time the Purser stated; 'you need to understand; our procedures; our manual and our training is that the customer comes before the pilot.' I used a firmer voice and said; 'I don't care about the passenger service; we need our food'. Basically his response was sorry that's the way it is! I decided to ACARS Dispatch to get the Duty Manager and an In-Flight supervisor in on the situation. Being refused food and not being contacted or checked in on by the Flight Attendants during the flight (not once) seemed unreasonable; but more importantly it was now deliberate and unsafe. I now realized there was a deliberate 'threat' building here by my very own co-workers and that I needed to address it. I asked to have In-Flight re-assign both the Purser and the Galley person to positions in the aft cabin and to send it over the ACARS. I felt this prudent to defuse the situation and get our food and beverages and that we needed a new Purser and Galley person who understood human physiological needs and 'Safety of Flight' issues. My request was denied by In-Flight operations stating they contractually cannot do that. I sent a message to Dispatch and said ok then I told them I would do it and sent them the details. (XC:00 ATO) Attempting to use 'all resources' to effectively manage this situation; I was going back and forth with dispatch on ACARS for 15 minutes trying to resolve a now serious distraction to the safety of our flight. I am now shocked to find out the Purser actually went on his break and was asleep in spite of my repeated requests for us to have food and knowing this was a major issue. When I called to have the Purser come to the cockpit so I could inform him of the crew position changes I was informed he was on his break and asleep. I am not sure which female Flight Attendant answered the phone but she hesitated when I asked to speak with him; in fact she seemed disturbed that I would call and wake him during his break. At this time I gave a direct order to this Flight Attendant to wake him and have him come to the cockpit with no delay. This was done and the Purser came into the cockpit and I informed him that the company is aware of the situation and that [another Flight Attendant] is now the Purser and that I allowed her to select our new galley person. The original Purser was speechless during my entire briefing as I informed him how both he and the galley person's behavior was appalling; disgusting and unsafe. He didn't respond and was expressionless. It didn't seem to bother him one bit.The Assistant Chief Pilot met the flight and was informed of the situation. He was professional and supportive. A Supervisor for the Flight Attendants then arrived. First Officer from my flight was present. We had a quick introduction and went to the first class cabin where all the Flight Attendants were sitting. Both supervisors were introduced and I went ahead and told them exactly what I thought of their behavior and how it negatively affected the flight. I told both the Purser and the galley person their behavior was disgusting; unprofessional and unsafe. I then repeated to the In-Flight Supervisor what the Purser had said to me: 'you need to understand; our procedures; our manual and our training is that the customer comes before the pilot.' I also explained about the three hours of no food in sight and then asked the supervisor to confirm if the above statement was true and his thoughts.In response; and without hesitation; Inflight Supervisor stated unequivocally: 'That's a true statement.'The Assistant Chief Pilot; did not appear happy with that response from the supervisor and jumped in to explain about 'Captain's Authority.' I was so disturbed by the statement that I informed the [Chief Pilot] was leaving because it was pointless to continue this dialogue. At this moment; I realized this is a much bigger issue.,,,,B-757 Captain described an unsatisfactory working relationship with the Purser and the galley person during an oceanic crossing.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight captain and the purser during a flight. The captain aimed to coordinate meal times with the crew and passengers but encountered delays. Despite his efforts to compromise, the purser prioritized passenger service over crew needs, leading to a breakdown in communication. The captain sought assistance from dispatch, requesting reassignment of the purser and galley person, but this was denied. The purser's unresponsiveness during a critical period further frustrated the captain, who then addressed the issue with higher authorities. However, the situation remained unresolved, highlighting a broader issue within the organization. The summary underscores the importance of balancing crew well-being with passenger service and the need for effective support structures.","crew-related issues, communication issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

She informed us that she wasn't in charge of the galley; but would check. We heard back that they would 'need to make some room in the oven' as they were already full with the first class meals. She made mention that she may need to cook them in the back; but since we were boarding she couldn't cook them on the ground. The Captain stated that it was fine; because we didn't want our meals until after we took off. One hour after departure; I called back to query the status of the meals; as I was the non-flying pilot. I spoke with [a flight attendant] who said that the meals had been cooked and she was waiting on a blocker. I called again [20 minutes later] and [the flight attendant] answered the interphone. I told him we had been waiting for our meals for an hour and a half. He stated that [they] didn't have a blocker; as they were finishing cart service in the back and were coordinating to open the door in a few minutes. After parking at the gate I was waiting for the Captain on the jet bridge. [Two flight attendants] questioned him about the crew meals. [One] said that they weren't allowed to interrupt the passenger service to bring us our crew meals. [Flight attendant] then stated that I was 'rude' and 'demanding'. I could hear the entire conversation from the jet bridge. The Captain stated that we coordinated on the ground for the meals after take-off and they should have been brought to us sooner. Being forced to wait for meals is a safety issue and we shouldn't need to call back multiple times to question the status to take us away from our flying duties. Furthermore; I think it was unprofessional for [the flight attendants] to question the Captain about his request for the meals early and complain about the First Officer while the passengers were deplaning. It causes me concern and makes me question [whether] direction by the cockpit could have been followed in an emergency.,,,,B737 First Officer reported difficulty getting the flight attendants to bring up crew meals in a timely fashion.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding the timely delivery of crew meals. The Captain requested the meals after takeoff, but the flight attendant indicated the galley was busy preparing first-class meals, suggesting they might be delayed. An hour later, the First Officer inquired about the meals and was told they were ready but needed a blocker. Upon follow-up, the flight attendant mentioned they were finishing passenger service. Post-landing, the Captain was approached by attendants who questioned the meal timing. One attendant criticized the First Officer, prompting the Captain to express concerns about professionalism and crew coordination during emergencies. The delayed meals were seen as a safety issue, affecting crew duties and raising questions about emergency preparedness.","safety related, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

I did my PAX count and handed it to the pilots; just as I was about to head back to the rear of the plane the gate agent stopped me. He then handed me two; what looked like boarding passes and said that I needed to upgrade YYD to ZZD; as she was next on the upgrade list; and also pointed out that the other paper was an interrupted travel itinerary for PAX XXD. He then told me that the PAX in XXD may have had a bit too much to drink earlier so keep an eye on him. I asked the agent if he was going to be an issue and he said that he should be fine but wanted to give us a heads up just in case. I then upgraded the PAX in YYD to ZZD and checked on the PAX in XXD and he appeared to be fine. I had no issue with him and he did not cause a scene or anything else. I then went back the aft galley and called the FA-A and told them to make the CA aware of the situation of the PAX in XXD; but to also let him know that there were no problems and we felt fine taking him with us on the flight. The PAX slept for most of the flight and did not want any snack or beverage during flight. Once we landed the PAX in XXC told FA-A as he was deplaning that the PAX in XXD had urinated in the seat during landing and was wiping the seat down as he left. FA-A told the CA and the CA called for hazmat to come clean the seat. When cleaning/doing seatbelts both I and the other FA did not touch seats XXC/D and also warned the incoming crew.My main concern is not the possibly intoxicated PAX as he was fine there were no issues at all. I'm mainly concerned about how the gate agent handled this situation. He never made the crew or CA aware of this PAX until just before shutting the main cabin door. We as a crew never had a chance to discuss the situation until it was thrown at us right as the Main Cabin Door (MCD) was being closed. These type of situations should be brought to our attention as soon as possible. Again I want to say my main concern is with the gate agent not handling this situation properly.,,,,EMB175 Flight Attendant reported being informed by the Customer Service Representative as the main cabin door is closed; that a passenger they boarded is intoxicated but shouldn't pose a problem. He did not; but the passenger seated next to the possibly intoxicated passenger informed the Flight Attendant during deplaning that the possible intoxicated passenger urinated in his seat during landing.,"An incident occurred on an EMB175 flight involving a flight attendant and ground personnel. The flight attendant completed the passenger count and handed it to the pilots. A gate agent approached them with two boarding passes: one for an upgrade request (YYD) and another for a passenger (XXD) with an interrupted travel itinerary, noting that XXD might have been intoxicated. The flight attendant upgraded YYD and monitored XXD, who appeared fine during the flight. Upon landing, passenger XXC informed the flight attendant that XXD had urinated in the seat during landing. The captain was alerted, and hazmat was called to clean the area. The flight attendants avoided the affected seats and notified the incoming crew. The flight attendant expressed concern about the gate agent's handling of the situation, stating that the crew was only informed just before the cabin door closed, leaving them unprepared. The primary issue was the lack of timely communication from the ground staff. The flight attendant suggested that ground personnel should inform the crew about such situations as soon as possible to ensure preparedness.","safety related, passenger-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people"

Had no official pickup time from hotel so went down at XA:05 local for a XB:47 departure to be sure we were on time. After about 40 minutes in lobby; saw a car from company which does our transportation dropping off a crew. Went out and asked if he was our ride to airport. He said no; but our ride would be there. Later; hotel employee asked if I was Captain X; I said I was. He said operations was on phone and wondered where we were. Replied still waiting for airport ride. He took contact information and called ride service. The problem was scheduling never arranged for ride to airport with re-assignment. Finally got ride to airport. Apparently; an announcement had been made; flight delayed due to pilots not showing up. True; but only because Scheduling hadn't done their job getting us transportation. Got on plane; first thing FAs say is they're 'pissed.' Don't ask what happened; just start yelling at us. Only FA A showed any professionalism; listened to flight brief etc. even after situation explained to FAs B and C. FA D never even showed his face. Our position and authority were totally undermined by company and FA behavior. Only FA A could have been counted on in an emergency. Shouldn't have even left the gate looking back on it. Only trying to make right by passengers drove us to continue. Both B and C made very disparaging comment upon their arrival to plane. An explanation of circumstances changed nothing. FA D totally pretended we didn't exist. Upon leaving plane I said see you to D; he said; 'oh yeah; you will see me.' Was this some sort of threat? We didn't even feel comfortable eating our meals; fear they'd be tampered with considering the FA vitriol. This wasn't a safe flight; and in fact we were working in a very hostile environment. Somebody at the Company failed to do their job; and it was blamed on the pilots. The safety of this flight was very impaired by the actions of FAs B; C; and D. And perhaps by whomever at the company didn't own up to their error; and blaming us. But the FAs need to be professional; even if it would have been our fault; which it wasn't. They compromised safety.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported being rescheduled during a layover; but the scheduling department failed to set up transportation resulting in a late arrival at the aircraft. The flight attendants are furious at the delay and are not interested in what caused it. The Captain believed that the safety of this flight was compromised by the attitude of the flight attendants.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight crew and three flight attendants (FAs) due to a scheduling mishap and subsequent professional misconduct. The flight crew was reassigned to an earlier flight without timely transportation arrangements, causing a delay. They waited 40 minutes for a ride, which was eventually arranged but led to the flight being delayed because the crew was late. Upon boarding, FAs B, C, and D displayed anger and hostility towards the crew without listening to their explanation. FAs B and C yelled and made disparaging comments, while FA D ignored the crew. Only FA A remained professional. The crew felt their authority was undermined and safety compromised by the FAs' behavior. They were uncomfortable, fearing potential tampering with their meals and feeling threatened by FA D's comment. Despite the hostile environment, the crew continued the flight to ensure passenger comfort, though they were uneasy. The crew accused the company of failing to address the scheduling error and blamed the FAs' unprofessional behavior for impairing flight safety. They emphasized the need for FAs to maintain professionalism, even in challenging situations.","crew-related issues, operational issues, safety related, between attendant and crew"

I apologized and quickly got him some paper towels and asked if he needed anything. At that point everything seemed fine. During arrival I was standing in the aft galley helping prepare for landing when the passenger came out of the lavatory with a full cup of liquid and threw it all over me splashing me in the face and all over my company provided Iphone 6. Passenger stated to me 'Happy Halloween xx.' I asked the passenger to take their seat as they repeatedly called me a 'xx' and an 'xx.' I then used a commanding voice for the passenger to return to his seat or I would be forced to have the police meet the aircraft. I called the Captain and informed [him] of what was going on he declared it as a level 2 threat and had the police met the aircraft. Inflight supervisor xx also meet the aircraft.

That passenger later threw a cup of water on the Flight Attendant and used abusive language. Police met the aircraft.,"The incident occurred during a flight when a Flight Attendant was collecting service items in the aisle. While handling a cup of water handed to her by a passenger in seat 31a, another passenger in seat 31c bumped her arm, causing a small spill of water on passenger 31d. The Flight Attendant apologized, provided paper towels, and inquired if the affected passenger needed further assistance. The situation appeared to be resolved at that point. However, upon arrival at the destination, the same passenger exited the lavatory with a full cup of liquid and threw it at the Flight Attendant, splashing her face and damaging her company-provided iPhone 6. The passenger also used abusive language, calling the Flight Attendant derogatory names. The Flight Attendant requested the passenger to return to their seat, warning that failure to do so would result in police intervention. The Flight Attendant informed the Captain, who escalated the situation to a Level 2 threat, prompting the police to board the aircraft. The passenger was ultimately removed from the aircraft, and statements were collected from the Flight Attendant, another Flight Attendant (FA), and the Captain.

There seems to be a pattern of passengers not complying with flight attendant instructions. Generally seat belt sign; or getting prepared for takeoff or landing; getting up after the 10;000 feet announcement; arguing general requests regarding safety etc. Some of this I attribute to passengers using their own electronic devices and earphones prior to takeoff and landing and therefore cannot hear our announcements. Some is just a sense of entitlement and their rights to do as they wish regardless of our instructions. On this particular flight; passengers were getting up and using the restrooms on our approach. Passengers were still putting away bags in the overheads after we had completed our checks and passengers were delaying turning off lap tops after several requests for them to do so. I have delayed writing this report to see if this was isolated; but it continues to happen on the majority of my flights.,,,,A Flight Attendant reported an increase in passengers not complying with regulations and Flight Attendant instructions.,"The incident involved a flight attendant reporting an increase in passenger non-compliance with safety regulations and instructions. The flight attendant described a pattern of passengers ignoring seatbelt instructions, using restrooms during critical phases of flight, and delaying compliance with requests to stow luggage and turn off electronic devices. Passengers were also observed using electronic devices and earphones, potentially preventing them from hearing safety announcements. Additionally, the flight attendant noted a perceived sense of entitlement among some passengers, leading to disregard for instructions. The flight attendant delayed reporting to determine if the behavior was isolated but observed it consistently across multiple flights, prompting the filing of this report. No specific solution was proposed in the context.","safety related, passenger-related issues, disruptive, between attendant and passengers"

I asked him to stow it. He became defensive and loudly said to me 'NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED ME TO DO THAT.' I asked again; and explained it was considered a carry on and therefore needed to go in the overhead; as he had no seat in front of him to stow it underneath. He again stated he had never been told to do that. He opened it and started to remove paperwork and personal items; and the passenger next to him asked me if that was ok. I said; yes he could secure those items in his hand; but not the backpack. I then placed the backpack in the overhead.As we were on the taxiway same passenger was on his phone. Passenger behind him looked at me to get my attention and pointed; at passenger and his phone and mouthed to me 'he is on the internet.' I tapped passenger on his shoe to get his attention and asked if he was in airplane mode. He replies; loudly; 'YES I AM AND WILL YOU STOP TOUCHING ME?' I answered; 'of course.' Passenger behind him; then taps him on the shoulder and says; 'I would appreciate it if you would do as you are asked; and get off your phone.' The father of the disruptive passenger turns around and states the son is using a certain app that isn't on the internet. The passenger who spoke up; looks at me and shakes his head. The disruptive passenger does not comply. When I hear the after takeoff chime; I go to the back galley and explain to [other Flight Attendant] what has been happening. We decide to switch and she will now [takes that part of the cabin]. This switch avoided further conflict between the disruptive passenger and myself. I don't believe I committed any errors. Passenger was not receptive to following directions; or to any verbal contact with me.,,,,A Flight Attendant reported that a passenger was not compliant in regard to stowing of baggage and electronic device usage.,"The incident began when a flight attendant (Party1) noticed a passenger (Party2) with a small backpack on his lap during the final cabin walk-through. The attendant asked the passenger to stow the backpack in the overhead bin, as it was considered carry-on luggage. The passenger became defensive, refusing to comply and stating that no one had ever asked him to do so. The situation escalated when the passenger opened the backpack and began removing items, despite the attendant's instructions to secure the items but not the backpack itself. The passenger continued to disregard the attendant's directives. Later, during taxiing, the passenger was observed using a phone, which drew the attention of another passenger who questioned whether it was permitted. The attendant tapped the passenger on the shoe to address the issue, asking if he was in airplane mode. The passenger loudly confirmed but became confrontational, telling the attendant to stop touching him. The passenger seated behind him then intervened, asking the disruptive passenger to follow instructions. The father of the disruptive passenger intervened, claiming the son was using an app that was not on the internet. The attendant decided to switch cabin sections to avoid further conflict, delegating the area to another flight attendant (Party1's colleague). This action aimed to de-escalate the situation and prevent further disruption. The flight attendant believed she handled the situation appropriately and did not feel she had made any errors. The disruptive passenger remained non-compliant and unresponsive to instructions. The incident was resolved without further escalation, as the attendant successfully transferred responsibility for the area to a colleague. The flight attendant's decision to switch cabin sections and transfer responsibility to another crew member was the proposed solution to avoid further conflict.","between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people, disruptive"

I was the A Flight Attendant (FA) so I made an all call to the crew to see if they smelled it also. All flight attendants smelled a strange odor. The front smelled like musty socks and the back smelled like parmesan cheese. I called the captain to tell him about the smell and he said they smelled it as well but they were climbing higher and thought it would dissipate. The D-E-H were all sitting in the forward galley with me. We all had headaches and distorted vision. Soon afterwards; I called the back galley to see if the odor dissipated; it didn't and was informed that our one pregnant (F) Flight attendant was being put on Oxygen. I called the captain to tell him that (F) was on oxygen and while I was on the phone I was informed B-C-F were all on Oxygen. I told the captain we didn't feel safe continuing. He said they were turning the plane around. I got up to go check on the FA's in the back and immediately felt light-headed and caught myself on the jumpseat. The E flight attendant told me to sit down and we got the oxygen bottles down and we were sharing the two bottles between the four of us. We were in the air for about 50 mins total. We landed at XA:14. Upon landing no one in inflight met our aircraft. The 'B' FA called crew service center and within 15 minutes inflight showed up to check on us. We told the inflight supervisors that we wanted to have blood tests run for Carbon Monoxide poisoning. They arranged for transportation to see a company doctor. We arrived there at XC:00. The company doctor said that he couldn't do the blood test. We were involved in many company calls through-out this ordeal and taxis were arranged for us to go to the hospital to get the blood test done. I was never seen by the company doctor since the taxis were on their way to take us to the Emergency Room (ER). A Manager showed up and about an hour later the taxis came. We arrived at the Hospital [5 hours after landing]. We saw the gate agent; who met our flight; in the ER waiting room; who didn't feel well; and we were informed also that three of our passengers needed treatment. The ER process was very fast and had blood drawn to check our CO levels. The doctor informed us that we should have been admitted soon after getting off the airplane. The test results will be forwarded to the company. According to Station Maintenance they washed the left engine the night before and were supposed to let it run for 10-20 minutes as procedure dictated; but the proper time wasn't allotted.I suggest during a fume incident that it should be company policy that you go straight to the ER for CO testing.I suggest that maintenance not take shortcuts when it comes to crew & passenger safety.,,We opened the auxiliary kit and put on masks. It was decided that the F needed to go on oxygen immediately as she is 5 months pregnant and we did not know what kind of fumes we were inhaling. Within 10 minutes from the beginning of the smell; we had 2 more bottles of oxygen between the other 3 of us in the back (B; C and G). The G decided not to use oxygen.Upon landing and deplaning we were not met by any manager; supervisor or paramedic. We had to call to ask someone to meet us. We were told by our pilots (who received information from the engineers); that the planes left engine had been cleaned the night before and 'may' not have had the engine run for 10-20 minutes to burn off chemicals; even though that is protocol after engines are cleaned.At this point; I was extremely disoriented; my eyes burned and I had a splitting headache. We all wanted to see a doctor and have our CO levels tested. Shayna began making calls and arranged for [medical] to pick us all up. It took over an hour between getting off the plane and being picked up to be checked out by the company doctor.We found out shortly after arriving at clinic that they would be unable to perform the blood test we needed done. At this point we were trying to get [ground] to take us someplace that could do the test. A Manager showed up and said taxis were on their way. It took about an hour and a half to be shuttled to the hospital.Once at the hospital; we were all admitted extremely quickly. Once I met with the doctor; my blood was drawn and tested for CO levels. The doctor told me it was most likely to come back with normal levels because of how long it had been since our exposure to the toxic fumes and that we should have been tested within a few hours. The test results will be forwarded to the company.There needs to be a very specific protocol for when there is a toxic fume event. We should NOT have been sent to [company medical provider]. They were extremely unprofessional and were unable to perform the test we needed done. Hours were lost spending time there and getting transportation to a location that was able to do the test.,,After takeoff; A330 flight attendants detected a strong chemical odor similar to 'spoiled eggs and vomit' which physiologically affected the crew and passengers. The flight returned to the departure airport. Post flight medical examinations revealed physiological symptoms; but blood tests samples were hours delayed and inconclusive.,"The incident involved a flight where a strong chemical odor, described as resembling spoiled eggs and vomit, was detected shortly after takeoff. This odor led to physiological symptoms such as headaches and vision issues among the flight attendants and passengers. The flight was subsequently turned around and returned to the departure airport. Upon landing, the crew experienced delays in receiving medical attention, as the initial medical provider was unable to conduct necessary blood tests promptly. The ground personnel indicated that the odor may have originated from the left engine, which had been cleaned the night before but not run long enough to eliminate fumes, as per protocol. The flight attendant suggested improved protocols for carbon monoxide testing and against maintenance shortcuts, while the ground personnel emphasized the need for specific procedures and criticized the delayed medical response. The medical tests conducted hours later were inconclusive due to the delay.","fume/smoke incident, safety related, operational issues, equipment malfunction, communication issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and other people"

On the first night all three flight attendants were placed on separate floors; causing unsafe hotel conditions. The problem was only fixed the next night after I; as A Flight Attendant; asked that it not happen again. Although the Captain did state during his briefing that safety was most important; he failed to communicate when there was turbulence. I understand that there are times when it comes on unexpectedly but when it did come on he would not switch the seat belt sign on until we called up to have it done; and did not call back to alert or inform us. He also opened the flight deck door to use the restroom without informing the flight attendants so that we could pull out a cart to block off the aisle. There was a pilot jumpseating in the flight deck; but blocking protocol should still have been followed. I quickly pulled a cart out when I saw him and blocked off the aisle as per procedure. During the last flight of the night we were experiencing extremely moderate turbulence; due to the storms on the East Coast; and as A Flight Attendant I determined that it was unsafe for the B and C flight attendants to be out in the aisles at all; let alone with a cart; so the C Flight Attendant called up to the Captain to ask if he could make an announcement that the last water and coffee service of the night would be canceled. When he did he told the passengers to ring their call button if they needed anything. While the flight attendants in the back were still experiencing turbulence the Captain asked for coffee; which is a hot beverage. As the water was shut off in the front galley the only coffee was in the back where they were experiencing the brunt of the turbulence that was already communicated to the pilots. Several landings were more rough than necessary; one caused several passengers in the cabin to scream; while another got aborted by ATC for coming in at the wrong angle. We had to re-ascend and do it over. We also had an on ground delay during the trip; and the Captain failed to update the passengers every 15 minutes as per protocol. When I asked him if there were any updates he was very short with me.It would seem to me that most of these problems could be solved by this pilot communicating better. The conditions of this trip were such that the flight attendants felt as though lines of communication were lacking between the Captain and cabin crew. This creates an unsafe work environment when the cabin crew does not feel comfortable communicating their conditions to the flight deck. On several occasions throughout the trip the flight attendants expressed to me their feelings of un-safeness. If an emergency were to happen we weren't sure that we would be given all the information we would need to properly keep passengers and ourselves safe.,,,,An A320 Lead Flight Attendant reported a Captain's poor communication skills made the crew feel unsafe after he refused to turn the seat belt sign ON during turbulence; disregarded the cabin crew's other requests and then requested hot coffee during turbulence. Poor landings and a go-around also contributed to the sense.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the captain regarding communication and safety protocols during a flight. The flight attendant reported that the captain demonstrated poor communication skills, which led to unsafe conditions for the cabin crew. Specific issues included the captain failing to promptly activate the seatbelt sign during turbulence, disregarding requests from the cabin crew, and requesting hot beverages during turbulent conditions. Additionally, the captain did not follow proper blocking protocols when using the restroom, and several rough landings, including an aborted landing, occurred. The flight attendant also noted that the captain did not provide timely updates to passengers during an on-ground delay, despite protocol requiring updates every 15 minutes. These incidents created a sense of insecurity among the cabin crew, as they felt communication lines were inadequate, potentially compromising safety in an emergency. The flight attendant suggested that improved communication between the captain and cabin crew could address these issues.","safety related, operational issues, communication issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

No inop or deactivated label was present by this CB and no documentation in the logbook could be found regarding this CB so Maintenance was notified. After Maintenance researched the aircraft's history no reason could be found for the CB to be open so the Mechanic closed the CB and signed off the corresponding logbook entry I had written. It is unknown how long this aircraft had been operating with this CB collared.Second; I was informed by the Purser that the aft galley had no electrical power so the utility bus switches were cycled to reset the system and I called a flight attendant in the aft galley to confirm if the galley had power. I was told the power was on and no mention was made of any open CB. I informed the Purser the aft galley power was on. Much later and just prior to departure I was informed that that the forward galley had no electrical power (in spite of the fact the First Officer had requested a cup of coffee some fifteen minutes earlier prior to departing on this all night flight). My experience and intuition dictated an inspection of the forward galley where I immediately discovered two forward galley CBs open. Again Maintenance was notified. The Mechanic informed me that earlier he had opened both the forward and aft galley CBs for reasons I do not fully understand but not related to any aircraft airworthiness or mechanical issue. The Mechanic reset the forward galley CBs and normal galley power was restored.Third; I then needed to confirm the aft galley was powered and if any crew member had reset the aft galley CBs. Power was normal and when asked directly about open CBs a flight attendant admitted that a flight attendant had reset the CBs. I asked him to come forward and we stepped onto the jet bridged where I discretely counseled him that he must never reset a CB and always inform the Captain of any CB that might be found open. The flight soon departed and upon arrival at our destination; as the crew deplaned; I asked three of the flight attendants what they believed should be done if they find a CB open. Their confident consensus was that they could reset the CB one time while on the ground and that notifying the Captain was not required. I informed them of the correct policy but they persisted that their rules allowed them to reset a CB. I further explained the policy was for safety reasons and that I was not authorized to ever reset a CB. I encouraged them to research the issue.It appears many flight attendants may not understand our CB policy and their responsibility to inform the Captain of aircraft discrepancies. Specifically; I recommend an immediate system wide electronic message to all flight attendants reminding them of the CB policy and their responsibility to inform the Captain of all maintenance related issues. Additional periodic training also seems to be required for all flight attendants. Note: On other flights; I have had flight attendants bypass me WHEN I'M PRESENT to inform Maintenance of an issue and only later do I happen to learn of the problem; and have been told by flight attendants pre-departure that: 'you can write it up when we get to our destination' as if they have that authority. Initiative by flight attendants to notify appropriate agencies for support should not be discouraged when the flight crew is not present but they should be reminded that they still have the responsibility to insure the Captain is informed.,,,,A B757-200 Captain utilized the occasion of finding an open and banded Circuit Breaker (CB) during preflight to address what he believes to be diametrically opposed understanding of undirected CB operation between flight crew and cabin staff. He further addressed what he believes to inappropriate direct flight attendant/maintenance interface without prior consultation with the Captain.,"During the pre-flight preparation for a B757-200 flight, the Captain discovered an open Circuit Breaker (CB) with a red collar in the potable water system. No documentation or labels indicated a known issue with the CB, so Maintenance was notified. After researching the aircraft's history, Maintenance found no explanation for the CB being open and closed it, signing off in the logbook. Later, the Captain addressed issues with galley power and discovered two forward galley CBs open. Maintenance explained they had opened and closed the forward and aft galley CBs earlier for unclear reasons, unrelated to airworthiness or mechanical issues. The Captain was concerned about the lack of communication regarding these actions. Upon further investigation, the Captain learned that a flight attendant had reset the aft galley CB without informing the Captain. The Captain discreetly counseled the flight attendant on the proper procedure to report any CB issues. After the flight, the Captain questioned other flight attendants about their understanding of CB policies. Their responses indicated a lack of awareness, as they believed they could reset CBs once without notifying the Captain. The Captain emphasized that flight attendants should always inform the Captain of any CB issues and highlighted the importance of adhering to safety protocols. The Captain recommended implementing a system-wide electronic message to remind all flight attendants of the CB policy and their responsibility to report discrepancies to the Captain. Additionally, periodic training was suggested to reinforce these procedures. The Captain also expressed concern about instances where flight attendants bypassed the Captain to communicate directly with Maintenance, even when the Captain was present.","communication issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew, training"

After landing they failed to deliver it to operations due to conflicting duties.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant on a B737-700 flight identified a passenger using a flameless military ration heater (FRH). The flight attendant confiscated the item, secured it by placing it in double bags, and stored it in the wheelchair compartment for the remainder of the flight. Upon landing, the flight attendant informed the Captain about the confiscation and the need to notify Ground Security but forgot to hand over the FRH due to being occupied with assisting an unaccompanied minor and managing crew changes. The FRH was not delivered to Ground Personnel after the flight, resulting in the item not being properly handed over. To prevent such occurrences, it is recommended that flight attendants implement a more rigorous handover procedure, such as setting reminders or ensuring a structured process for transferring items to Ground Personnel, especially when faced with multiple duties post-landing.","operational issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and other people"

I stopped the passenger from going to seat and asked where he put the cigarette. He denied it of course and when he opened his mouth it was as if a cloud of smoke came out. The smell was so strong. I had him stand in galley while I searched the LAV with the door opened. I opened the trash bin and pulled out the compartment. There was a bunch of paper towels and one Budweiser can (he had been drinking that). I pulled can out and smoke was coming out of the can. I called for the other Flight Attendant to get me a bunch of bottles of water while I put the can under water in the sink. I poured about 4 bottles into the can to ensure there was no possibility of a fire. He still continued to deny he did anything; but I said you were the only one drinking Budweiser and you were the only one in the LAV in the last half hour. I told him to give me his ID and go to his seat. He said 'can I talk to you?' To which I replied 'give me your ID take your seat and I will speak to you later.' Flight Attendant B notified A; who notified the Captain. Flight Attendant A made another no smoking announcement. I copied his information and filled out crewmember report of smoking. I gave him the bottom portion which notifies him that the incident will be reported to FAA. I also returned his ID. He started to say something and I stopped him. I said to him that he needed to really think about what could have happened to all of us on the aircraft because of his irresponsible and dangerous action.

Flight Attendant B noticed the odor, confronted the passenger, and discovered a smoldering cigarette inside a beer can. She extinguished the cigarette by submerging the can in water and notified the other flight attendant and the captain. Flight Attendant A made a subsequent no-smoking announcement, and the passenger was required to provide his ID and return to his seat.

I was the #4 Flight Attendant this flight. At around 500 FT before landing I looked over at the Number 2 Flight Attendant on this flight and we both just stared at each other and then looked outside to see where we were to touching down. I knew we were too high to land and that our landing did not feel normal. The plane started to sink; and we heard the engines being pushed to throttle and we thought the pilot was going to possibly attempt a go-around. We hit the runway incredibly hard bounced up in the air and then I felt the right wing tip way to way close to the ground. I was actually looking outside to see just how close we were to hitting the wing tip and rolling over. At this point the plane was sideways and was squirreling all over the place. I thought we were going to have a crash landing. After we got to the gate at no time did the pilots call back and see if we were ok. The pilots at no time made a P.A. to the people about what had just happened. After the passengers deplaned and we got up to the flight deck; myself and the Number 2 Flight Attendant; we asked the Number 1 Flight Attendant where the flight deck was. Number 1 stated the Captain told her; 'I can't believe I almost crashed this plane and took off outside to look at the plane'. After our 2nd terrifying landing in 2 weeks on another 737; and not being able to talk to our Captain or First Officer; the Numbner 2 and I removed ourselves from our last two legs of our trip. We both were shook up. This was our 2nd unreal and terrible distressing landing in 2 weeks. On both of these incidents the weather did not play a factor. It was sunny and warm. On our flight back to base one of our 737 Captains had just finished his recurrent training. We had both flown many times together without such incidents taking place. He was the only pilot to give us some possible explanations. One; on the earlier incident; the Captain was new to the left seat and needs additional training. Or two it was a max flaps 40 involvement. He explained that some pilots like to practice using the 40 setting; when it really is only supposed to be used on short runways like LGA; DCA; and BOS. At our meeting; the Chief Pilot was initially in the meeting and told my friend and I that; 'this would happen again.' This statement was shocking to us because we have both flown this plane many times without these terrible landings taking place. It should be noted that for many years both Number 2 and I have flown the 737 and every plane this airline has had and never had any landings like these last two.This incident was on our first trip of the month. The earlier event; we had completed a turn I was the Number 4 Flight Attendant; and my friend was the Number 2 Flight Attendant on this flight. This was a really terrifying landing. The Captain came on the P.A. and told us and the passengers that it was 84 degrees and the wind was 5 MPH. He then told us to prepare for landing. My friend and I prepared the cabin and did our final cabin checks and took our jump seats and belted in. We first started to feel our plane did not feel right as we were around approximately 1;000 FT. We looked at each other and looked outside to see how close we were getting to touching down. As we stated to get closer to landing we both knew that everything about this landing did not feel normal; the position of the plane and the attitude. We hit so hard the plane bounced 8 to 9 feet; slammed down again on the runway and we bounced another 5 feet; and then our planes wings tipped so low to the ground; they went right to left and I told my friend to 'cover her eyes.' We both felt the plane was going to crash. After we got to the gate again the pilots never came on to talk to the passengers or to us the crew. By the time the Number 2 and I got up to the flight deck the Captain was gone. My friend spoke to the First Officer; and asked; 'what just happened; what was the landing all about?' The First Officer replied something about the winds; and my friend said no; there was no wind. Then the First Officer told my friend 'that the Captain was fairly new to the left seat'. This was a terrifying landing.,,The event occurred because the pilot lost wind. He was going to do a go-around but decided to land the aircraft because he was lined up. However; we were still too high when he landed and we knew he was making a decision when we heard the engines flare and then we dropped down around 50 feet to the ground.We are the eyes and ears of this operation so everyone says. However; when we have negative issues to discuss most pilots leave us hanging with unresolved answers and emotions. Yes; we are able to feel when things are off with the engines; landings; weather. If the only thing the pilot is worried about is his aircraft and not his crew; we have a long way to go. A pilot that clearly knows that an incident occurred should at the very least call back and make sure that his crew is ok. If he could provide information as to what happened; would be great. Everyone says the back of the B737 feels totally different from the front of the aircraft and it's true.,,Two B737-800 Flight Attendants report a Captain; apparently new to the left seat; lost control of the aircraft in the flare and made a very hard landing which resulted in two bounces before coming to stop.,"The incident involved two hard landings on a B737-800 aircraft, experienced by two flight attendants during separate flights. In both cases, the landings were described as abnormal, with the aircraft feeling unstable and the pilots failing to communicate effectively with the cabin crew or passengers afterward. The first landing occurred during final approach, with the aircraft feeling too high before touchdown. The plane bounced upon impact, with the right wing tip nearly touching the ground, causing concern among the flight attendants about a potential crash. After the incident, the pilots did not address the crew or passengers, leaving the flight attendants unsettled. The second landing was similarly hard, with the aircraft bouncing multiple times and the wings tilting dangerously low. The flight attendants reported that the captain, who was apparently new to the left seat, lost control during the flare. After landing, the captain did not communicate with the crew, and the first officer mentioned the captain's inexperience as a possible contributing factor. Both incidents occurred under clear weather conditions, with no apparent external factors. The flight attendants expressed frustration over the lack of communication from the pilots and the unresolved nature of the incidents. They also noted that the captain may have been practicing with max flaps 40, which is typically reserved for short runways, as a potential factor in the hard landings. The flight attendants removed themselves from their duties following the second incident, citing the traumatic nature of the events and their concern for safety. The chief pilot acknowledged the issue but did not provide a definitive resolution, leaving the flight attendants shaken and uncertain about future flights. The attendants suggested that the captain, who was new to the left seat, may require additional training, particularly regarding the appropriate use of flaps during landing. They also emphasized the need for better communication between pilots and cabin crew in the event of an incident.","safety related, crew-related issues, communication issues, operational issues, training, between attendant and crew"

During set up ACARS and the printer operated normally. We briefed the departure (including the maintenance release status) approximately 20 minutes before schedule departure. A few minutes later we received an ACARS message that a new maintenance release was required as well as a status message on the printer advising the aircraft was ready for release. Before having an opportunity to address the maintenance status the lead flight attendant advised she was concerned about the location of an armed passenger and the status of a dog on board and advised another attendant had had a verbal conflict with a gate agent regarding overhead bin space and was asking for our intervention. Finally after dealing with these issues we pushed back and immediately realized we hadn't called maintenance about the unusual maintenance release status. Maintenance attempted to send the release to the printer but were unable. They then sent a truck out with a hard copy passed in through a cockpit window.  We; then; started engines and continued the flight uneventfully.,,[Report narrative contained no pertinent additional information.],,Broken and deferred communications functions of ACARS combined with conflicts between flight attendants and passenger agents created a chaotic pre-departure scene which culminated with the flight crew's failure to obtain a hard copy maintenance release prior to gate departure.,"The incident occurred during the pre-departure phase of a flight, involving the Flight Crew and ground personnel. The Flight Crew encountered issues with the ACARS system, which was deferred, and the inoperative printer. Despite initial normal functionality during setup, they received conflicting messages about a maintenance release and aircraft readiness. Before addressing this, they had to handle concerns from the flight attendants regarding an armed passenger, a dog onboard, and a verbal conflict with a gate agent over overhead bin space. After resolving these issues, the crew pushed back and started engines, only to realize they lacked a maintenance release. Maintenance attempted to send the release digitally but failed, opting instead to deliver a hard copy via the cockpit window. The flight crew proceeded safely with the hard copy. The incident was caused by communication system failures and conflicts, leading to the delayed acquisition of necessary documentation, but the flight continued without further issues.","communication issues, crew-related issues, equipment malfunction, between attendant and other people"

The cabin crew had not completed their final safety checks and announcements when the 'clear for departure' chime sounded. As a result, the cabin crew was still in the aisle when the aircraft began takeoff, leading to one flight attendant being thrown and struggling to secure their harness. The flight crew also faced difficulties as a flight crew member was thrown against the galley, dropping their equipment. The cause was the cabin crew's inability to finish their safety procedures before takeoff. The process involved the premature initiation of takeoff without the cabin being secure. The result was a safety concern due to the crew's struggles during takeoff. A proposed solution was for the flight deck to wait for the cabin to be secure before allowing takeoff.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

First officer looked through the peephole and informed me a passenger was at the door. I rang the flight attendant call button and the passenger picked up the inter phone. He informed us that our flight attendant was sick and was being attended to by another passenger.  He stated that she needed medical attention. I asked him to identify any passengers in the cabin with medical training to assist in helping flight attendant. I asked him to answer the phone when I called back for more information. I declared an emergency with ATC and requested a diversion to [a nearby airport]. We were cleared direct. I notified our dispatcher via ACARS of our diversion and situation. I rang the flight attendant call button and the same passenger as before answered. I asked him if the flight attendant was conscious. He said yes. I asked him what was wrong with her. He said she has a terrible headache and she was weak. I told him we would be landing in 10 minutes and we were going to have paramedics meet the plane.First officer and I began preparations for landing. I made a passenger announcement with our diversion information and instructions to stow personal belongings; fasten seatbelts; and remain seated for landing.A couple minutes later the flight attendant called us on the inter phone. She informed me that she had a terrible headache but she believed she was able to continue the flight. I told her the decision to divert had already been made and that we would be landing in eight minutes. I asked her to remain seated for the rest of the flight.I contacted [airport operations] and gave them our ETA. We made a visual approach; landed; and taxied to the gate. Paramedics were standing by and assisted flight attendant off of the airplane. I made a PA; spoke with the station manager; and then went to check on flight attendant. The paramedics recommended a medical evaluation and that flight attendant was refusing further treatment. They had given her and she was using an oxygen mask.I asked flight attendant how she was feeling. She said she had a headache but it was better than before. I told her that it would be a good idea to follow the paramedic's advice. I told her we couldn't continue the flight and that I feared she may not be safe if she had an ongoing medical issue. She then agreed to go with the paramedics to the hospital for a medical evaluation.In the mean time operations had communicated a plan to accommodate our passengers to first officer. He briefed me and we coordinated deplaning the passengers with station operations. I spoke with a flight attendant supervisor; a hub coordinator; and our dispatcher over the phone.

I notified the captain. On the CRJ-700; the main cabin door is the main source of egress in an emergency evacuation.  The configuration of the stairs on the inside of the cabin contain instructions for properly closing and opening the door.  In an emergency where the flight attendant is incapacitated; passengers must open the door.  The stairs on this aircraft were installed incorrectly and the instructions; placards; emergency lights and instructions are in the incorrect place; thereby potentially causing a delay in evacuating the aircraft in the event of an emergency.  Incorrect configuration of the main cabin door. This issue would have caused multiple cancellations and delays; however; I would insist on contacting Maintenance and checking the procedures before completing the flight.,Reporter stated that two of the raised steps on the main cabin door were not reinstalled to their original positions during a C-Check; after the main door had been reconnected to the CRJ-700 aircraft. With the door in the 'open' position; the second raised step from the bottom was swapped with the third step. The second step has a recessed handgrip in the step plate that is used to pull and guide the door during latch handle closing; opening and during emergency exiting. The third raised step from the bottom has placards for exit; door open/close procedures; emergency open procedures; and an emergency light. The steps were out of sequence.Reporter stated the Captain would not call Maintenance or write-up the incorrect step configuration due to lack of company Maintenance at the stations they were flying to. Other flight attendants told her the same condition had also been found on their CRJ-200 series aircraft; but no one was correcting or taking the situation seriously.  Contact was made with a Maintenance Manager who pulled the aircraft from service within three hours after being made aware of the situation. The discrepancy was corrected. Maintenance Manager noted that mechanics and Quality Assurance had missed the incorrect step configuration during reinstallation of the door.

Flight Crew reported to Maintenance a squeal in the cabin during Deadhead to ZZZ1. Line Maintenance arrived to investigate and requested Flight Crew to start engines with [Main Cabin] door shut. After listening in the cabin at normal pressure levels on the ground; Maintenance put aircraft pressurization system into manual mode and descended the cabin until reaching 3.0 psi and back to unpressurized; approximately 15 minutes. Crew experienced uncomfortable ear pressure but no other medical concerns. Maintenance tightened a connection in Pack-1 and Aircraft returned to service. In ZZZ; the following morning; Captain obtained a copy of the Maintenance procedures including the BOLD WARNING about non-essential personnel not being onboard. This pressurization took the flight crew to a cabin altitude below sea level; there is concern similar to a scuba dive. Pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable. Company Medical was called; but by this time it was 24 hours past the pressurization event. The flight attendant; who has a hearing impairment and wears hearing aids; reported being more plugged up than usual and was removed at Company Medical Doctor's request. The Flight Crew unaware pressurization to 3.0 psi was planned. Line Maintenance did not have copy of procedure with them. Flight Crew unaware of potential hazard due to no briefing from Maintenance personnel and no written copy of maintenance procedure. Ensure that when procedures are communicated from Maintenance Control to Line Maintenance; that warnings are transmitted. Provide written guidance on Flight Crew assisting Maintenance or provide adequate personnel to perform procedure without ANY assistance from Flight Crew.,Reporter stated the air conditioning packs on the EMB-145 are located in the wing root area under the cabin seats. The cabin pressure controller knob is extremely sensitive and controlling a rate of descent of 500 feet per minute is very difficult in the manual mode. The EICAS display indicated the cabin pressure had gone down to 1;500 feet during the ground pressurization leak check. What the actual pressure ended up being; he is not sure; but flying at altitude after that may not have been advisable as he learned later.,Crew was Deadheading in the cabin on an EMB-145 aircraft to ZZZ1 and heard a squeal sound when pilots added power. Upon landing captain informed Maintenance Control. Control contacted ZZZ1 contract mechanic to investigate a squeal sound in the aircraft cabin. Maintenance Control directed crew to start engines while contract mechanic and Maintenance Control investigated the squeal. Contract mechanic was on the phone with Maintenance Control. The mechanics believed the issue was a loose connection in the PACK systems. However; without the flight crew knowing; Maintenance Control directed contract mechanic to conduct an 'air check.'Crew was unaware of this procedure and not briefed prior. Contract mechanic did not have a checklist. Flight Attendant was onboard. Contract mechanic; under the direction of Maintenance Control; and without warning to the crew onboard; pressurized the cabin substantially below sea level using the manual mode pressurization system to achieve a 3.0 psi pressure differential. Crew and contract mechanic experienced uncomfortable ear pressures during the procedure and the procedure was stopped within 15 minutes. Contract mechanic tightened the PACK connections and under the direction of Maintenance Control the contract mechanic signed off his work. Crew did not report any medical conditions preventing the safe operation of the aircraft. Flight operated safely back to base; conducting flight back to ZZZ. This report is being submitted for the operation of two flights; ZZZ-ZZZ1-ZZZ; because the crew were on board an aircraft which was pressurized below sea level prior to these flights. The concern arises from the possibility that pressurizing the aircraft to a pressure below sea level may expose flight crews to injuries similar to those of scuba divers. Captain contacted Maintenance Controller X who stated that this procedure was not dangerous. Captain obtained the 'leak check' procedure from ZZZ Company Maintenance department and found the procedure was not what the crew witnessed. The crew did not have prior knowledge of the Medical Warning found on page one of the procedure. Captain contacted ZZZ Chief Pilot who did not know how to proceed but directed the captain to Company Medical. Captain called Company Medical whose Doctor concluded that further flights would be safe because 12-hours had elapsed from the exposure. However; Flight Attendant; who wears hearing aids was removed by Company Medical Doctor to evaluate ear conditions prior flying again.Crew was not briefed that Maintenance Control had directed contract mechanic to conduct a 'leak check.' Contract mechanic under the authority of Maintenance Control conducted the check without a visual checklist. This is not the first report captain has submitted highlighting the prevalence of Maintenance Control talking contract mechanics through a procedure via telephone. This practice is potentially dangerous especially if the WARNINGS in the procedures are not communicated to those persons inside an aircraft during these procedures. Company should issue written standards to the flight department outlining the approved procedures which would allow pilots and crew to assist contract mechanics with the servicing and maintaining of the aircraft fleet. These verbal procedures are potentially hazardous especially to flight crew because flight crew often operate in extreme environments and with limited time on the ground to acclimate or recover from exposures. Because the FAA relies largely on the science of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) for infection control procedures; then FAA should likely consult hyperbaric medical societies for procedures involving aircraft pressurization and the standards for medical screening of crew and passengers involved in these procedures and involved in inflight rapid depressurization events.,,A Contract Mechanic was directed by Maintenance Control to pressurize the cabin of an EMB-145 aircraft to below sea level in the manual mode. Flight crew and Flight Attendant were not made aware after being requested to start engines with the main cabin door closed. Uncomfortable ear pressure was experienced. Crew departed in the morning; but pressurization and flight at altitude may not have been advisable due to scuba dive effect.,"The incident involved an EMB-145 aircraft operated by a flight crew from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and back. During the deadhead trip, the crew heard a squeal in the cabin and reported it to maintenance. Maintenance requested the crew to start engines with the cabin door closed and proceeded to manually pressurize the cabin to 3.0 psi without informing the crew. This resulted in uncomfortable ear pressure for the crew and the flight attendant, who has a hearing impairment, leading to her removal by a doctor. The root cause was the maintenance team's failure to brief the crew, lack of a checklist, and reliance on verbal procedures. The captain later discovered that the procedure followed wasn't the standard one, and this wasn't the first such incident, highlighting potential dangers of verbal communication in extreme environments. The proposed solutions include establishing written company procedures for maintenance and crew assistance, and consulting medical experts for safer pressurization standards. The outcome emphasized the need for clear communication and standardized procedures to prevent future incidents.","crew-related issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, communication issues, health and medical issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers"

My partner & I were dispatched to repair the items that the crew had written in the logbook. My partner & I repaired multiple coach seat issues & flight deck door issues. The logbook was signed and return to the flight deck. As we exit the acft the flight attendant called us back to the acft and mentioned to us that the ELT lanyard was unfolding. I removed the ELT from behind first class seats. I showed her that one of the water automatic release tape came unfastened. I mentioned to her to have the crew put it in the logbook when they arrived at the acft. I also mentioned to her that I am removing the ELT from the acft for repair and I will be returning with it prior to departure for re-installment to the acft. I went to the stock room at the hangar and to obtain another automatic release tape and res-secured the lanyard to the ELT. I immediately return to [the gate] to find out that the acft had already left without the ELT. I immediately notify my lead and he immediately notify the tower foreman. Tower foreman notify us that the acft was getting ready for takeoff and he was unable to have it return to the gate. Tower foreman mention to us that acft was scheduled to depart at XA:55. It left early at XA:44. Acft had already departed and the ELT was still in my possession. Flight attendant probably forgot to mention to the crew when they arrived to the acft. She probably became distracted while performing her cabin duties. Have the flight attendant put the discrepancy in her cabin logbook or remove the logbook from the acft. Upon returning to the acft; have the crew put it in the logbook,,,,A Mechanic removed a component from the aircraft to perform a repair. In the process; the Mechanic notified the Flight Attendant to advise the Flight Crew to write it up. When the Mechanic returned to the gate; the aircraft had departed without the component.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant and a Flight Crew member were involved in aircraft maintenance. The aircraft had logged maintenance issues that were addressed by the maintenance team, including the Flight Attendant. Upon leaving the aircraft, the Flight Attendant noticed an unfolding ELT lanyard. The Mechanist removed the ELT for repair and instructed the Flight Attendant to inform the crew to log the issue. However, the aircraft departed without the ELT, as the Mechanist returned to find it had left early. The cause was likely a communication breakdown, with the Flight Attendant failing to inform the crew, possibly due to being distracted. The result was a potential safety issue with the missing ELT. The proposed solution was for the Flight Attendant to note the discrepancy in the logbook or remove it.","between attendant and crew, communication issues, safety related, operational issues, crew-related issues"

We landed in ZZZ and deplaning took time. We had a full load of passengers and numerous wheelchairs.  Cockpit crew finished their day and left the aircraft.  Flight Attendants waited for the last passenger to deplane and walked out the Jetway with the Ground Agent. I asked the Agent which gate was Flight ABCC.  Agent responded 'Gate XX'.As I look to the right at Gate XX the agents are in the process of pulling tickets and boarding the aircraft.  The captain was behind the podium pulling his paperwork.  As I approached the gate I thought another flight may have still been on the gate. Then I read the signage at Gate XX; Flight ABCC. I asked the pilot if he was working the Flight ABCC.  He answered 'yes'. I told him we were his cabin crew.  Because of our late arrival time from ZZZ1 did they pull another crew to work to ZZZ3?  The captain gave me the crew list and we were still the original working crew. I asked 'Who is on the aircraft boarding the flight? I stated to the agent 'We are the working crew'. 'Who is on the aircraft boarding the flight'?Agent A looked at Agent B and asked 'Didn't you check the crew?  Who is on board the aircraft'?  Agent A sent Agent B down the Jetway to check if there was a crew on board.  Agent A then checked my ID and the rest of the working crew ID's and we proceeded down the Jetway. We passed Agent B in the Jetway and she confirmed there was 'no crew on board'.  This was a 757 aircraft; we were using the L2 door for boarding.I entered the aircraft there were between 10-15 passengers on board. Approximately six (6) passengers in First Class; the catering representative in the First Class galley wanting to check the galley packing; a non-working uniformed pilot was trying to stow his too-fat for the overhead suitcase in the closet; agent gave an unaccompanied child UNACH to Flight Attendant #4 to sign for and bring on board the aircraft; before the cabin crew had a chance to stow our luggage and check out safety equipment.,,,,A B757 flight attendant crew arrived late for their flight because of weather delays and found that the gate agents had begun boarding their flight without them having had the opportunity to do their pre-flight checks. The aircraft was not ready for boarding.,"The incident occurred when a flight attendant crew, delayed by 1 hour and 19 minutes due to weather conditions, snow, and de-icing, arrived at the gate to find that boarding had already begun for their flight without them. The ground personnel had started the process of boarding the aircraft, with approximately 10-15 passengers on board, including an unaccompanied child and crew members stowing personal luggage, despite the flight attendants not having completed their pre-flight safety checks. The flight attendants were initially mistaken for another crew due to a miscommunication. After verifying their identities and confirming that no other crew was on board, the original flight attendant crew proceeded to board the aircraft. The situation was resolved when the original crew assumed their duties, but the incident highlighted the importance of proper crew communication and pre-flight preparation to ensure passenger safety.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew, weather related"

The gate agent informed me that there was no dispatch paperwork available and the aircraft was parked remotely off the gate; and that we would have to wait for it to be positioned at the gate by the ramp crew. At 30 mins prior; the plane was finally brought to the gate. Also; the dispatch paperwork was provided at approximately this same time. Upon reaching the aircraft; we found the aircraft was being fueled; and therefore we could not power up the aircraft until the fueling was complete per SOPs. I informed the gate of this minor delay in boarding and told them that we would board as soon as we could power up the aircraft to do our preflight. A few mins later; as fueling was completed I powered up the aircraft and we were beginning our preflight when a second gate agent walked onto the plane and demanded to know why we were not ready to board! I informed this new person of the late aircraft positioning by the ramp and of the fueling delay. As soon as we could board; we did; and all the passengers were on the plane 9-10 mins prior to departure; so we were in good shape to make an on time departure. The gate agent informed the Flight Attendant (FA) that all the passengers were on board so she began her physical passenger count. I continued my preflight duties and was looking through the paperwork when I looked out the window and realized the jet bridge had been pulled away from the aircraft. I then turned around to see the FA helping passengers and finishing her count in the middle of the aircraft. Because this aircraft had a plug door without stairs; I recognized what I believed to be a serious safety issue with the door open and no bridge attached. So I got out of the cockpit and pulled the Main Cabin Door into the closed position to keep anyone from inadvertently falling onto the ramp. I then called OPS and queried them about why the jet bridge had been pulled away from the aircraft without any communication with the flight crew. Their response was that they 'are understaffed' Moments later; a ramp agent came and slammed the handle down from outside the aircraft. I again got out of the cockpit and opened the door to have a discussion with this ramp agent to inform him of my safety concern of him slamming the door handle from the outside; and showed him the inside door handle that could have broke the FA's arm if she had had her hand on it at the same time.The main concern of the ramp agents and gate agents was to get the aircraft out on time; with little regard for the crew or the passengers' safety. About this time the FA asked me if the gate agent had given us a passenger count to confirm with her count. So I had to now contact OPS to ask for the passenger count to confirm with the FA's count because the gate agent pulled the jet bridge before confirming the count as we usually do.As I settled back into my cockpit duties to continue with my paperwork; I reviewed an MEL on the release that required the flight crew to physically check that the baggage door was secured from outside; so I immediately called OPS and requested the jet bridge be brought back to the aircraft to complete this task. This was 5 mins prior to departure; I was told to 'standby'. When OPS responded on the radio about a minute later; I was told that they would not reposition the bridge until I gave them a valid reason; and so I informed them of the MEL procedure that needed to be accomplished. It took another 3 mins for them to move the jet bridge back to the aircraft. When I got into the jet bridge; I was confronted by a male gate agent who appeared to be a Lead; but was not wearing a red coat. He proceeded to tell me that I was 'inconveniencing 46 passengers on the plane!' The ramp supervisor was there too; and I explained to him the MEL and my need to physically confirm the baggage door per the MEL. Heagreed and immediately accommodated me; walking with me down the jet bridge stairs and to the bag door. He was THE ONLY PERSON from the whole ground operation who was willing to help me keep the process moving! Unfortunately; by the time he personally had gotten involved; the safety issues had already been dealt with and we were now a late departure.The station operation team needs to understand that communication with the flight crew prior to removing a jet bridge from an airplane is vital to SAFETY. I don't think it is ever safe to have passengers on board an aircraft without stairs and an unmonitored door! I also think that in the interest of security; the gate agent needs to be in the jet bridge next to the airplane until the passenger count can be verified with the flight crew. Safety and Security ALWAYS needs to be placed above an on time departure! Also; if there is a safety or security concern raised with OPS; the ramp supervisor should immediately make himself available to the flight crew to attempt to resolve the situation.,,,,An EMB-145 Captain narrates a distressing breakdown in teamwork between ground personnel versus flight and cabin crews in a dispute over whether to work together to follow the rules--and regulations--for a safe and legal operation or to just get the jet out of the gate on time.,"The incident involved a conflict between ground personnel and the flight crew of an EMB-145 aircraft during pre-flight operations. The ground crew, aiming for on-time departure, removed the jet bridge prematurely while passengers were onboard and the door was open without stairs, posing a safety risk. The flight crew, led by the Captain, addressed this by closing the door, communicating with Operations (OPS), and emphasizing safety protocols. Despite OPS initially refusing to reposition the jet bridge, the ramp supervisor eventually assisted, though the departure was delayed. The Captain highlighted the need for improved communication and prioritization of safety over timeliness to prevent such issues.","safety related, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

During the course of the discussion we determined that the difference in sound was due to the much colder weather in Airport ZZZ. At that time; tower cleared us for takeoff; which we accepted. We accomplished the takeoff check; took the runway for departure; and climbed out uneventfully. After notifying the flight attendants that we were above 10;000 feet; one of them called to inform us that we had neglected to inform them that we were ready for takeoff; and one of them had to rush back to her seat to get seated on time. We apologized to the flight attendants; then the Captain and I reviewed the events leading up to takeoff and determined that we had forgotten to accomplish the Before Takeoff checklist; resulting in the failure to notify the flight attendants.Threats include the potential for missing an item on the checklist; which happened; and could have resulted in injury to the flight attendants. Slow down and verify following any anomaly after pushback; but before takeoff.,,[Report narrative contained no aditional information].,,A CRJ-700 flight crew; taxiing for takeoff; were distracted by unusual nose gear sounds they determined to be associated with the cold conditions. When they were then cleared for takeoff in advance of arriving at the departure runway they mentally entered the 'takeoff mental mode' and departed without completing the before takeoff checklist and; thus; had failed to advise the flight attendants of their imminent departure. Upon climbing through 10;000 feet the flight attendants called to notify of their incomplete SOP.,"The incident involved a CRJ-700 flight crew and a flight attendant. The flight crew was distracted by unusual nose gear sounds during taxi-out, which they later attributed to cold weather conditions at the airport. Due to this distraction, the crew failed to complete the Before Takeoff checklist, resulting in them forgetting to inform the flight attendants of the readiness for takeoff. After climbing through 10,000 feet, the flight attendants notified the crew of the missed procedure, as one attendant had to rush back to her seat. The crew apologized, reviewed the events, and identified the missed checklist as the cause. The proposed solution was to slow down and verify all procedures after any anomaly before takeoff.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew, weather related"

I asked Mr. X to buckle his seatbelt and that is when his wife; Mrs. X; seated in XXE; advised me that Mr. X suffered from dementia. I proceeded to assist Mr. X and buckled his seatbelt around him. While completing our safety checks for landing; I noticed that Mr. X did not have his seatbelt fastened. I again asked Mr. X to buckle up for landing. He was not complying; so I assisted Mr. X by buckling his seatbelt for him. I proceeded to my jumpseat and buckled in. While seated I had heard the noises of a seatbelt being unbuckled. I turned around and looked up the aisle toward the forward part of the aircraft and noticed that Mr. X had his seatbelt unbuckled and hanging in the aisle. I proceeded to get up and inform Mr. X that his seatbelt need to be fastened for landing. He made some unrecognizable noises and words and proceeded to stand up and enter the aisle of the aircraft. I advised Mr. X that he needed to seated for landing. There was a lady passenger seated in front of him in XYD that had an infant attached to her in a Baby Bjorn type of harness. Mr. X proceeded to attempt to grab the child by placing his hands under each of the infants' arms. The pax in XYD was in complete shock. I tried to get Mr. X to release the child. Once I did so; Mr. X continued to stay in the aisle of the aircraft when I heard the landing gear deploy. Once again; I asked Mr. X to take his seat for landing and he continued to stand in the aisle. The following happened in order: Mr. X refused to listen to our orders to sit down in his seat for landing.Mr. X became slightly combative with the female passenger seated in XXC who was trying to help. Mr. X grabbed her right wrist tightly causing discomfort and pain. Once FA in the back and I realized how close we were to the ground due to fog; we had to stay standing in the aisle to protect Mr. X. I proceeded to try and get around Mr. X to make sure I was standing in front of him to protect him from lurching forward once we touched down on the runway. FA stayed [in] the back to make sure Mr. X did not fall backwards. While going around Mr. X; he pushed his backside against me and pushed me into the passenger seated at XYC. He then yelled at me telling me I was an '[expletive]' I repeatedly told Mr. X that 'I am here for your safety!! I am here for your safety!!'FA notified the Purser of the situation once we had landed. Purser then relayed the information to the flight deck crew. Mr. X continued to walk around the back cabin and aft galley as we taxied in and FA blocked the doors preventing Mr. X from trying to open the doors while they were armed. I stood between Mr. X and the infant child seated in XYD since the mother was frightened by the earlier actions.

He refused to obey commands to fasten his seatbelt and on final approach; stood up in the cabin and alarmed other passengers with his odd behavior. The flight attendants kept the unruly passenger from the armed exit doors until blocked in at the gate.,"The incident occurred on an Air Carrier flight during which a Flight Attendant (FA) encountered a non-compliant passenger, Mr. X, who suffered from dementia. The cause of the incident was Mr. X's refusal to fasten his seatbelt during both takeoff and landing, despite the FA's assistance in securing it. During the final approach, Mr. X unbuckled his seatbelt, stood in the aisle, and displayed erratic behavior, including attempting to grab an infant from a nearby passenger, which alarmed other passengers. The process of the incident involved the FA repeatedly attempting to assist Mr. X in complying with safety protocols. However, Mr. X became combative, grabbing a female passenger's wrist and yelling at the FA. As the aircraft approached the runway, the FA and another FA stationed in the back worked to protect Mr. X from potential injury during landing by positioning themselves strategically. Once the aircraft landed and taxied to the gate, the FAs ensured Mr. X remained in the cabin and prevented him from accessing the exit doors while they were armed. The FAs remained with Mr. X until the aircraft was secured at the gate. The result of the incident was the successful containment of Mr. X and the protection of other passengers and crew until the situation was resolved safely. No physical harm was reported, and the FAs effectively managed the situation.","safety related, passenger-related issues, disruptive, between attendant and passengers"

After running our checklist I emerged from the cockpit and heard a hissing sound that I recognized from our EVAC simulator; the sound of a slide deploying. I peered around the corner of my doorway and saw door 1R open; with the red tape still across the viewport and the slide pack flopped out onto the deck of a catering truck. The slide luckily had not inflated. I immediately told the caterer; who had stepped into the cabin over the slide into the galley and the flight attendants in the area; to get away from the area in case the slide was still able to inflate. On debriefing; it turned out the caterer had opened the door without getting the ok; with the red tape still across the viewport; indicating the door was still armed.When the mechanics arrived and secured the slide; we discussed how the door; when opened from outside; is supposed to disarm. It had not. Also; that the position of the slide as it landed; it should have deployed and inflated; it also had not. On further investigation; the mechanic found that the slide had a date on it of 1994. I don't know what the required inspection intervals for the slides are; but 21 years seems excessive. Today; we were in fact very lucky these failures occurred.,,,,A flight crew on arrival at the gate noted that a caterer opened up an armed door with the red tape still across the viewport and the slide pack flopped out onto the deck of a catering truck. The slide did not inflate.  Mechanics were called.  The slide was long overdue for inspection.,"The incident occurred after a flight crew arrived at the gate in DEN when a caterer opened an armed door without authorization, with the red tape still across the viewport, causing the slide pack to deploy onto the deck of a catering truck. The slide did not inflate, and the flight attendant instructed the caterer and nearby crew to move away to avoid potential risks. Mechanics were summoned, and they discovered that the slide had not been inspected since 1994, far exceeding the required inspection intervals.

We were on an aircraft that does not nor has it ever had life vests under the seats for as long as it has been in the fleet. Because we were in sterile flight deck; I waited until we got above 10;000 feet; made my announcement; helped the B Flight Attendant set up her cart; then called the flight deck to notify them of the issue in the recording with the faulty information. My First Officer (FO) answered and I explained to him the issue with the recording saying we had life vests under the seats when we don't; and this aircraft is not supposed to. I told him that I had this aircraft a week or two ago and had already notified management of this issue; but figured since it obviously didn't get resolved yet that maybe it could get corrected while the plane was on overnight if they could write it up or if they knew of a form I could fill out. I was trying to be proactive about a safety issue. My first officer asked a few questions about it to get an understanding of how this aircraft was not supposed to have that recording and how this aircraft never had life vests under the seats to begin with.  I had some troubles hearing him as his microphone was not that loud/clear and it was very loud in the galley. We did end the conversation with an understanding of what the issue was to my knowledge. I hung up with him; at this point the B Flight Attendant had finished her meal service and was breaking down her cart when the phone rang with the flight deck calling. It was my Captain (CA) this time. At this point the plane had made either a slight descent or they slowed down (I could not tell) then the CA proceeded to tell me that the First Officer (FO) was freaking out saying that I told him that we were supposed to have life vests under the seats and we didn't. The CA then told me that they have been in communication with the company that we were going to divert making a code yellow emergency landing in 10 minutes because the FO was freaking out about us not having life vests. I asked the CA if he was serious; which he replied with 'yes' and then I asked him if we could avoid the diversion; that we did not need life vests and he said 'no.' I told the captain that I never told the FO we were supposed to have life vests; that I told him the opposite. The CA then told me that the FO said I did tell him we were missing life vests under the seats that we were supposed to have. I told him no I didn't; that I thought he understood me; but I could hardly understand him.  The CA then said to me 'oh so you're throwing my partner under the bus now?' I said 'no.' He then proceeded to tell me to stay calm about the code yellow emergency landing; let the B Flight Attendant know; he read off the current time to signify the start of the emergency landing; and to pack up all of stuff for landing. That we would be on the ground in 10 minutes and that I needed to call management right away; because they wanted to talk to me about this.  I said ok. The CA said he was going to make an announcement to the passengers at this time to let them know what was going on. My CA's voice during this conversation was stern and gave zero indication that this was anything but serious. I was freaked out; and started to brief my FA with what was going on.  Within a minute or two the flight deck called back while I was briefing her. It was my CA on the phone; and asked if it was me he was speaking with.  Then when I replied 'yes; it is' he started cracking up laughing and said he was kidding; that we were 37 minutes of from landing at destination.  At this point I was so freaked out about him telling me that we were having an emergency landing and that management wanted to talk to me I don't remember what I responded with. Probably something along the lines of 'not cool.' I told the B Flight Attendant thatI felt like I was about to pass out because I was so worked up. At this point CRM had been broken. After that we continued to put our stuff away and take care of our passengers. We could hear loud laughing and talking from the flight deck the rest of the flight. The pilots ended up blowing a procedure by being distracted by their joke and never gave a PA descent announcement to us or the passengers. We started to get pretty low; so I checked my cellphone app to see how far out we were. At this point we were less than 15 minutes out with no announcement or anything from the flight deck. I made the descent announcement to the passengers and within 2 minutes later the 10;000 foot chime went off. We landed and I did not communicate with my pilots. The only thing my CA said to me as I was packing up my bags was that I had a lot of bags and was high maintenance because of that; with a demeaning tone. The B Flight Attendant heard him say this; and told me 'wow; he's picking on you.' I did not reply as I was upset about them joking around about an emergency landing and management wanting to talk to me about it. CRM had already been broken.,,When I had finished my beverage service and was tearing down my cart when the other Flight Attendant (FA); started briefing me that we were going to divert and do an emergency landing. The flight deck then called interrupting her. After she got off the phone she told me they said they were just joking about the emergency landing. She then explained that it started when she had called the Flight deck to ask them to write up the [safety video]. The flight deck played a joke on her saying that because the [safety video] was inaccurate we must land immediately and that he was going to make an announcement to the passengers and she would need to contact management after we landed. Because of this there was a breakdown of CRM. The pilots behaved inappropriately by joking about an emergency landing.,,Regional jet flight attendants discover that the prerecorded passenger safety briefing incorrectly refers to life vests under the seats. The flight crew is notified of the discrepancy and they turn it into a prank stating they will have to make an emergency diversion. A few minutes later they call back to reveal the prank and that they are continuing to destination.,"The incident occurred on a regional jet during a flight when a Flight Attendant (FA) discovered that the prerecorded passenger safety briefing incorrectly stated that life vests were stored under the seats. The aircraft in question does not have life vests under the seats, as it has never been equipped with them. The FA reported this discrepancy to the flight deck after reaching 10,000 feet, informing the First Officer (FO) and subsequently the Captain (CA) about the issue. The FA also mentioned that she had previously reported this problem to management but had not received a resolution. During the communication, the FO misunderstood the FA's intent and believed she was indicating that the aircraft was missing life vests. This misunderstanding led the FO to inform the CA that an emergency landing was necessary. The CA, unaware of the confusion, prepared for a code yellow emergency landing, informing the passengers and directing the FA to contact management immediately. The FA vehemently denied having suggested that life vests were missing, emphasizing that she had pointed out the safety video's inaccuracy. The situation escalated when the CA called the FA again, revealing that the FO had misrepresented the situation. The CA admitted that the previous communication about the emergency landing was a joke, causing further confusion and distress for the FA. The FA felt targeted and upset, particularly when the CA laughed off the situation and corrected the timeline for landing, leaving the passengers and crew uninformed about the delay. The breakdown in Crew Resource Management (CRM) was further evident when the flight deck failed to provide a proper descent announcement, requiring the FA to inform the passengers herself. Upon landing, the CA made a demeaning comment about the FA's luggage, which was overheard by the other Flight Attendant. The incident resulted in a significant breakdown of CRM, impacting the professionalism and safety of the flight. The FA suggested addressing the faulty safety video as a solution to prevent similar issues in the future.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, emergency, between attendant and crew"

I could feel that we had started our descent.  I had begun normal landing duties (tidying up the galley and general duties).  I did hear the slats come down; however I just thought we were trying to slow down as little.  Next thing I hear is the gear come down.  I had been trying to look out and see how high we were; however I was unable to due to the visibility outside.  As soon as I heard the gear drop I called the flight deck and advised them that the cabin was NO WHERE near secure for landing; as no information was given to the flight attendants.  Also once I called the flight deck; then did the sterile light come on.  I advised them; we had kids standing up; bags out; people out of their seatbelts; and again that the cabin was not secure.  I was asked by the flight deck if we needed to go around; I stated 'YES'.  I was then asked; can you just sit down for landing.  I said UMMMMM yup and hung up the phone!  I made a PA; Flight attendant be seated for landing.  I secured the galley as fast as I could.  And sat in my jump seat; as did the B Flight Attendant.  No final descent announcement was given at all; as there was just not time.  We landed and taxied to the gate with no incident.  After landing; the Captain apologized to me many times.  He stated that they were extremely busy with weather and trying to figure out if we were going to divert to our [alternate].  At the very last minute; the weather improved and they shot the approach and forgot all about us in the back.Flight deck does get busy at times; however they cannot lose sight of what is going on in the back of the aircraft.  We should have gone around and made sure our passengers were safe and secure; even if that meant we had to divert to our [alternate] if the condition had deteriorated.,,,,An ERJ-175 Flight Attendant reported they landed before the cabin was safe and ready because the flight crew rushed due to weather concerns.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and the Flight Crew of an ERJ-175 aircraft. The Flight Attendant reported that the cabin was not properly secured for landing due to a lack of communication from the flight deck. The flight crew was preoccupied with weather concerns and attempting to decide whether to divert to an alternate airport. Despite the Flight Attendant's repeated warnings that the cabin was not ready, the flight crew proceeded with landing. The aircraft landed safely and taxied to the gate without further incident. The captain later apologized, acknowledging that the cabin safety had been overlooked due to their preoccupation with weather conditions. The Flight Attendant suggested that the flight crew should have prioritized ensuring cabin safety by going around and delaying the landing if necessary, even if it meant diverting to the alternate airport.","crew-related issues, communication issues, safety related, weather related, between attendant and crew"

Whenever any passenger requested any sort of assistance from medical to a snack we were providing it to them. Flight attendants were making attempt to inform our base supervisor and crew services of the situations taking place on the aircraft. XA:30Pilot informed Lead Flight Attendant (LFA) of diversion to a nearby airport. The landing was going to take place rather fast. At this time LFA informed the other flight attendants of the diversion. Pilot In Command (PIC) made the PA announcement that the flight will be landing in ZZZ due to unable to land at our filed destination due to weather. LFA followed up with a PA announcement indicating the diversion. Also; stated for flight attendants to begin preparing the cabin for arrival. XA:454 chimes - Flight attendants picked up remaining service items and LFA did final compliance walk for landing. XB:02 (Actual)LFA made the arrival announcement.XB:05Aircraft was parked on Tarmac. LFA began Tarmac record. LFA pulled up Tarmac Delay information in [the Ipad]. Passengers begin standing in the aisle stretching legs and standing in line for the 3 lavatories on board. XB:25 [A] Passenger's wife came forward to the galley and stated husband is feeling very nauseous. FA 3 provided his wife with ginger ale; water; trash bag and offered a snack. At this time she refused a snack for him. Then [FA 3] followed passengers to seat to assess.XB:32LFA advised PIC we were in need of our official block out time for delay record. Instead of the block out time PIC informed lead we do not have this time since we are sitting on an active Tarmac. Instead noted and gave the arrival time into the divert airport. XB:42 PIC made announcement we were expecting to depart ZZZ and head to ZZZ1 in about an 1 hour and fifteen minutes. This would give the crew an ETA into our original destination of XC:57. With this ETA given lead then discussed with Flight Deck (FD) the potential for a pour service to be needed. Flight attendants were advised against a pour and snack service to be conducted. XC:00Passengers came forward and stated she was a diabetic and insulin was under the plane. She said she was due for it in about an hour. If we could give her some M&M's and water she would be fine until the delay is completed. Even though this was a medical related issue we did not have to ask for a doctor. Flight deck was notified by LFA. From XB:02 till XC:00 all doors on the aircraft were armed during the tarmac delay! XC:06 The flight deck made an announcement that the aircraft would be taxing to a different fueling area. LFA made prior to aircraft movement announcement minus electronic devices to ensure compliance before saying it was safe to move aircraft. LFA walked the cabin to ensure compliance. FA 2 and 4 were seated in jump seat with aft barrier strap up. FA 2 stated aft cabin secure. A single chime [to] flight deck to signal cabin was ready for movement. Flight deck then called and asked if we were ready for movement. LFA stated to captain 'this is why I single chimed you'.XC:20 Aircraft arrived at fueling area. Captain asked if doors were armed if so they needed to be disarmed because we were about to fuel. LFA made the announcement FA prepare doors for arrival.XC:23 [FA 3] who injured himself earlier on the deicing fluid in the cabin while stowing his baggage before departure FA 2 saw him limping. FA 2 called forward to ask if there was [a] bandage in the First aid kit. LFA looked at the items in our First Aid kit and we did not have [a] bandage. FA 2 came forward to get ice for the customer. XC:27[Another] passenger who had Claustrophobia came forward to the bulk head just looking for space away from other passengers and crew members. Crew members remembered this passenger from the previous week flight. Atthis point we noticed [passenger] very hot; sweaty and in a panic. She was saying can I just get air! She then began vomiting in the trash bag in the galley. LFA made the announcement of do we have any doctors or nurses on board and if so can you ring your FA call button. At this time LFA also notified the flight deck of the situation and we were filling out a cabin report. While the nurse who was chosen by [flight crew] as our medical personnel from mid cabin to come forward. LFA stayed with the passenger ensuring her everything was going to be ok and we were working with the FD for passengers to get off the aircraft.XC:29 PIC headed to aft of the aircraft to do a walk around. PIC asked flight attendants 2 and 4 to hold and watch the tail cone door exit. At this time he went down the steps the FA had deemed to be 'hazardous'.XC:31First Officer (FO) called [FA] into the FD after the cabin report had been given to them. With the cabin report [medical services] was contacted. Once [medical services] was contacted FO gave [FA] his personal cell phone to have the conversation with [medical services]. [Medical services] advised the passenger to begin doing breathing exercises. [Medical services] wanted the use of [oxygen]. [A FA] got the [oxygen] uncovered the mask and the customer felt like it would make her become more claustrophobic. On the cabin report the only medication the passenger stated she had taken was Gravol. At the time I did not know what Gravol was. Passenger said it was motion sickness medicine. When I was writing this report I researched what this drug is. According to [website] Gravol is a new synthetic drug. It is highly addictive and makes users dangerously paranoid; to the point of suicide. It also causes paranoia; kidney failure; hallucination. During the conversation with [medical services] I initiated a crew to crew call with [medical services]. During this short called I asked her to come forward and help with the passenger. [Medical services] at this time stated that the only medicine in our Medical kit which could be administered to the passengers was Benadryl. Passengers refused the Benadryl as well and stated the Gravol should work. Passenger asked if she could sit in a seat in the bulkhead. One of the passengers in [bulkhead seat] heard this comment be made and was willing to move to [passengers] seat. [passenger] thanked the guy in [bulkhead] for doing this for us. [Passenger] calmed down once this decision was made. XC:40 FA 4 stated beverage and snack service as requested was needed for the cabin. Lead had lost track of time during the medicals and everything else; which was taking place in the cabin. Lead notified FD pour service was beginning. XC:41 FA immediately began pour service. We used the plastic bins inside the carts lined them up with cups and started pouring water into them. During this pour service we ran out of water on the carts and crew water. The only water we had left was the water bottles the crew had already drank out of. This service was completed by the 120 minute mark of the delay. XD:19Lead notified Captain we were right at the 3 hour mark of the delay. Passengers even after the service began getting upset. LFA notified flight deck the passengers were beginning to get upset. During the Tarmac delay instead of using the Interphone system to communicate with lead. The flight deck was just opening the door to have communication. LFA ask flight deck if we can go to normal procedures to open the door due how the passengers were being. At this time LFA notified captain that we are getting close to that 3 hour mark of the delay. Asked captain to make another announcement. XD:21Captain advised lead we were about to taxi to gate. FA prepare doors for departure announcement was made. Aircraft was prepared for taxi to the gate. FA did compliance check.XD:27 Announcement was made to prepare doors for arrival. Captain notified FA that the aft stairs would be used for deplaning. FA 2 notified lead the aft stairs were not safe to deplane off of due to the slick liquid (De icing liquid) on the stairs. LFA notified Crew services we did not feel it was safe. They advised us that passengers should take all belongings because there was a chance the plane was going to get Remain Overnight (RON) for the night in the divert airport.XE:30 Captain advised to deplane from the aft stairs even though FA advised against it. As soon as this announcement was made passengers began deplaning prior to LFA finishing her conversation with her supervisor. Once off the phone LFA advised passengers to take all carry on luggage with them down the back stairs of the aircraft and use caution exiting. During the deplaning process [ill passenger's] bag was taken in. LFA asked FD if she could exit aircraft to retrieve her bag. They told LFA to have her contact our supervisor. During the time frame of XE:50 and XG:45[Ill passengers] exited the aircraft not long after the passengers did to deplane. When [medical services] got back onto the plane they stated the passengers are in the terminal area and no one is giving them any updates. They just wanted the pilots or some airline employee to give some updates! XG:45 Began boarding again up the tail cone stairs; which was contaminated with both snow and the deicing fluid. FD asked LFA if we were ok with doing this. After discussion with the crew we decided since they already deplaned off these stairs. It's not safe but [might] as well board and get to our filed destination! Now while boarding the water from snow melting in combination with the deicing fluid made more of the aisle way slick. Just like it was in the departure airport. The flight attendants tried to [mitigate] any risk while boarding and LFA made boarding announcements like normal. While boarding a gentleman near the front of the aircraft stated his name was not on the manifest the gate agent was using. LFA notified flight deck. LFA told the flight deck this could be seen as a security issue. PIC stated a gate agent must tell the flight deck no security issues prior to pushing back. After it appeared boarding was complete FA 2 completed a count when I read the verification announcement. FA's noted we were missing 8 people. This was verified by the gate agent giving FA 2 the names of the individuals to read on the PA. The FA 2 told passengers to ring their FA call buttons if they were on board. FA 4 and 3 re briefed exit rows. PIC handed the paper work through the window of the aircraft to a gate agent. LFA stated 'Cabin Secure!; Clear to Close?' I single chimed FD indicating we were ready for push back. FA 3 asked lead if she was ok with doing the safety demo and she would read the safety demo. I said yes and I did the safety demo in the cabin. After the safety demo I walked down the aisle to ensure compliance again. Once I got back informed passengers we would be dimming the cabin lights for departure and read the deicing announcement. XH:15Finally; we landed in our originally filed destination. Arrival announcement was made and we apologized for the delay. Also; stated use caution when exiting the aircraft and getting carry on luggage out of the over head bins. LFA made the FA prepare doors for arrival announcement was made. LFA did her cabin sweep of any left items and cross checked all doors were not armed.XH:58 Crew called crew services to find out information about ride to hotel; what hotel we are staying in and what our show time is for the next day. Finally got the [hotel] our crew was dead tired. We all just wanted to check in and put our heads on a pillow. The day had used every ounce of energy we had. Once I walked up stairs to my room the hall way smelled as if smoking had been taking place. It didn't smell like cigarettes to me. Being in aviation I wasn't ok with the smell I was smelling just in case I was to get drug tested. I exited the room o,,,,A MD-80 Flight Attendant described crew and passenger behavior following a weather related diversion. After a three hour ground delay with passenger illnesses and unrest the flight taxied to the gate. Later; the flight re-boarded for its original destination.,"The incident involved a weather-related diversion of an MD-80 flight, causing a three-hour ground delay. During the delay, flight attendants managed medical situations, including a passenger experiencing nausea and a claustrophobic episode, while also addressing passenger unrest. Despite challenges with cabin service and communication, the crew eventually re-boarded the aircraft and proceeded to the original destination, ensuring a safe arrival. The flight attendants coordinated with ground staff for hotel arrangements, concluding a taxing day with fatigue.","weather related, health and medical issues, passenger-related issues, crew-related issues, communication issues, operational issues, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and crew"

The pilots were with us. The agents looked surprised about this. Unknown to us; they had already started boarding the aircraft. One Agent ran down the jetbridge to stop boarding. We stated that all passengers needed to deplane so we could do our emergency equipment checks; etc. The passengers deplaned aircraft and the Agent stated that a bag was still on board. We asked that the bag be removed by the Agent before we board ourselves. She needed to find the owner of the bag. After the passengers reboarded and the bins closed; the agent was ready to close the aircraft door. The first Flight Attendant stated no because we had Maintenance on board. The Agent did not seem to be aware of this issue.,,When the flight attendants and pilots arrived [at the gate] we noticed 3 agents boarding the aircraft. The Captain said 'is there something we dont know about?' The Agent continued to board the aircraft. We told her we were the crew. She said 'isn't the crew down there?' We said we did not know; we had just arrived. She ran down the jetbridge. I told an agent I was the first Flight Attendant; but she did not look at my ID. I went down the jetbridge to find out what was happening. I saw 10 people on the jetbridge with the Agent and I told her we would need time to check out equipement. When I got on the aircraft; there were 15 people on the aircraft with no personel on board. We told her everyone had to get off. When everyone deplaned; there was still a bag on board. We told her she had to take that too. Three agents boarded an airplane with no flight attendants on board. Then; she tried to close the door without talking to the flight attendants and pilots. He told her do not close the door; we had a mechanical [issue]. She apologized.,,Two flight attendants report how agents began to board passengers before the flight crew had arrived. They were surprised to discover that neither pilots or flight attendants were on board.,"The incident involved a conflict between ground personnel and flight attendants over boarding procedures at the gate. Ground personnel began boarding passengers before the flight crew arrived, which surprised the flight attendants and pilots. The flight attendants requested that all passengers deplane to perform emergency equipment checks, and after the passengers reboarded, the ground personnel attempted to close the aircraft door without consulting the flight crew. The flight attendants informed the ground personnel that maintenance personnel were still on board, preventing the door from being closed. The ground personnel ultimately apologized for the misunderstanding. No formal solution was proposed during the incident, but the issue was resolved through communication and clarification.","operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and other people"

I explained that overhead bins were [still] open as the last of the passengers had just entered; and a long line in the aisle was still present. I told her that it was 11 minutes until scheduled departure. I had also informed the gate agents twice during boarding that oversized carry on baggage was entering the aircraft. The agent Supervisor stated that the cargo [bin] had already closed. I told her that we may still have bags to check due to [being] oversized. At that time a bag came to the [forward] galley that was obviously well larger than the bag sizer would allow. The agent Supervisor repeated that the cargo [bin] was closed. I told her we may have additional bags to check. I also told her not to close the aircraft entry door until I could get the overhead bins closed. As soon as I left the immediate area; the agent Supervisor told [another Flight Attendant] that they had to go and proceeded to close the entry door. The FAR for overhead bin was violated. The FAR for stacked luggage in the closet was violated since additional oversized bags were on the plane and the only option was to stack them in the forward closet. The aircraft entry door was closed 5 minutes before scheduled departure time. The event occurred because the agent Supervisor for this flight would not listen to the Purser! This is an ongoing occurrence at this station for this flight.,,I was [on duty as a Flight Attendant] in back of aircraft during boarding assisting passengers and closing overhead bins; working my way forward. I then heard from another Flight Attendant that the boarding door had been closed by the agent before we had all the baggage stored and all overhead bins had been closed. To my best knowledge the agent was in a hurry and closed aircraft door before cabin was ready. The flight attendant in front of aircraft and entrance door is the only one who can deal with the agent because the other flight attendant is in the cabin doing their duties. I had no knowledge that the door had even been closed prematurely. I was closing bins as my duties required.,,Contrary to policy and flight attendant direction; a gate agent closed the cabin door before the cabin was fully prepared.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and a ground personnel supervisor over closing the aircraft door prematurely. The supervisor aimed to close the door 11 minutes before departure, despite the flight attendant's communication that overhead bins were still open and passengers were boarding. The supervisor proceeded to close the door despite the flight attendant's instructions, violating FARs and causing an ongoing issue. The flight attendant highlighted the need for adherence to safety protocols, and the recurring nature of the problem suggests a potential need for improved communication or procedural changes to prevent future occurrences.","safety related, crew-related issues, communication issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

I stood up and knocked on the door and told the passenger to take her seat we were landing. She said she had to pee and she could 'do what ever she wanted.' I knocked again on the door and asked her if she was smoking in there because I could smell smoke and the smoke alarm was going off so she needed to get out right now! She said that I could not tell her what to do! The cockpit called back to inform us they had a light that said smoke in the lav and we informed him that we had a passenger that refused to go back to her seat. The landing gear was coming down and at this point I told her she better stay in there (if she came out she couldn't get to her seat without endangering the passenger in XXC) The Captain made a PA for the passenger in the lav to return to her seat immediately! She came out; cussing up a storm; and had sprayed something in the lav that she claimed was feminine hygiene spray. I repeated 'were you smoking in there?' She started waving her arms and saying 'she could do whatever the [explitive] she wanted and no one could [explitive] tell her what to do' over and over.Another Flight Attendant got her to sit down with the assistance of the passenger in XXC. I talked to the cockpit and informed them that she was now seated and her seat number. The Captain asked me to check the lav to make sure nothing was on fire and I did. She had sprayed something in there to hide the smell of smoke and it was overpowering! No cigs were found in trash can so I took my seat. There was no reason for her to spray that spray and be so defiant if she wasn't guilty! I smell cigarettes and the smoke alarm was going off. I did not smell her spray until she opened the door! She was 2 steps away from the lav the entire flight and she chose to go to the bathroom after we were seated! Police met the flight and questioned her and never came in to check the lav. This woman interfered with the duties of the flight crew; caused alarms to go off in the cockpit during sterile cockpit; told us we couldn't tell her what the [explitive] to do; and almost caused us to land standing up. She should not be allowed to fly again if she can't follow instructions and is going to carry on the way she did! Unfortunately; I believe the police let her go. They asked us if she did finally sit down; which she did...but that was not the problem; the problem was that she was smoking in lav! That is against FAA regulations; if was not just her not complying with crew member instructions...Unbelievable!,,,,An unruly passenger entered a lavatory on approach; apparently lit a cigarette and eventually set off the smoke alarm. The reporter/Flight Attendant's attempts to extricate the passenger were unsuccessful until the Captain made an announcement demanding she return to her seat. She then left the lav; which reeked with what she claimed was a feminine hygiene product; and excoriated the reporter in vulgar terms. The passenger was detained by airport police.,"The incident occurred during the approach to landing when a passenger entered the lavatory, lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke alarm and message panel. The Flight Attendant requested the passenger return to her seat, but she refused. The Captain addressed the passenger via a public announcement, prompting her to exit the lavatory, where she cursed and claimed to have used feminine hygiene spray. The Flight Attendant discovered the spray but no cigarettes, suggesting the passenger's defiance indicated guilt. The smoke alarm disrupted cockpit communication during a critical phase. The passenger was detained by police but not arrested. The Flight Attendant believes FAA regulations should be enforced against her for smoking in the lavatory and non-compliance.","safety related, passenger-related issues, emergency, operational issues, communication issues, disruptive, fume/smoke incident, between attendant and passengers"

Aircraft resumed taxiing; making lots of turns and stops. The arrival announcements had been done; passengers were complying; by staying seated and bags stowed. The aircraft came to a stop; several bells went off and the seat belt sign was turned off. I made the 'disarm door' announcement; turned the cabin lights to bright and disarmed the 1R. When I was ready to disarm 1L I looked out the door window; I did not see ANYTHING!!! I heard the engine running but that is not unusual. I looked again to see if I had made a mistake and the seat belt sign was actually still on-- NO it wasn't; so I called the flight deck. I asked Captain if we were at the gate. He replied NO and I told him we had gotten several bells and the seat belt sign was off. He turned on the sign; I re-armed my 1R; made an announcement that there was a malfunction with our bell system; we needed everyone to take their seats; [and] we were resuming the taxi. Most of the bags were down already. We closed the overheads. There was no way; or time; to put the bags back; as we were moving again. I felt the passengers being seated were more important; at this moment. We did not have an option to stow bags. It was not a safe situation; if an evacuation had been warranted we would have had a lot of bags going down slides (they wouldn't have had to waste time to get them; they already had them-- a little sarcasm- given the number of bags that came off). Once we did reach our gate; the sign went off again and I made the door disarm announcement. Needless to say; they deplaned quickly because they had all their items ready. Captain was very apologetic; He said there was an aircraft taxiing towards us at one point; he reached up to turn off the nose gear light; and inadvertently hit the 'seat belt sign' switch. When I explained; to him; what had happened in the cabin; he said we did what we could have; given the circumstances. He wouldn't have been able to stop long enough for us to get everything stowed. I can tell you; we held our breath until we were safely at the gate. I might have seen that we were a long way from the terminal if I had looked out the 1R door before disarming it; but that is NOT part of the procedure at that door. When I did look out 1L; which was when I noticed that there were NO lights; and NO terminal. I relied solely on the bells and seat belt sign being turned off. The viewing ports/windows on the Airbus doors - do NOT look out; unless you are bent over looking outside- instead; from a seated position; you see the ground- NOT the surrounding area.,,,,After landing and a lengthy taxi the aircraft is stopped and the seat belt sign is turned off. The Lead Flight Attendant makes the arrival announcement and disarms door 1R before turning to door 1L and discovering the aircraft is not at the gate and the passengers are all standing with their luggage in the aisle. The Captain had inadvertently turned off the seatbelt sign while attempting to turn off the taxi light.,"The incident occurred after the aircraft landed and was taxiing to the gate. The seatbelt sign was inadvertently turned off by the Captain while attempting to adjust the taxi light. This led the cabin crew to believe the aircraft had arrived at the gate. The Lead Flight Attendant instructed passengers to return to their seats and continue moving, as stowing luggage wasn't feasible. Upon reaching the gate, the correct signal was given, allowing a quick deplaning. The crew's prompt action ensured passenger safety despite the initial confusion.","crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

I explained to him that we do not open the doors from the inside but the caterer could open it from the outside. An Agent Supervisor (a woman in street clothes) came down and insisted that I open the door and I explained again that we do not open doors from the inside. She said that she was calling Inflight [Services].She called me out to the jetway phone and said that when it rang again it would be an Inflight Supervisor. When I answered the Supervisor never asked me what was going on or what the problem was; simply started quoting manual chapters to me. I told her that it is hammered into us all year that we do not open the doors from the inside. She said that I had to open the door. When I objected she said 'SWEETIE I am an Inflight Supervisor.' I then had another Flight Attendant confirm the door was disarmed and I opened it. I was forced to open a door with a large wheelchair sitting in front of the door and leaning out a four story open door with a straight drop to concrete. After I opened the door they discovered that the lift would not even come close to the door opening. Now I was forced to lean out the four story drop again to close the door that should never have been opened. So I had placed myself in danger for nothing.They then did what they should have done in the first place before causing a thirty minute delay and found a way to get it out via the jetway. Our Inflight Manual; section XXXXX says; 'flight attendants are NEVER to open an aircraft door from the inside...that; if there is a problem; they should contact an agent or Maintenance'. If the Inflight Supervisor had asked questions she would have [learned] how dangerous her demands were. If I had bumped the wheelchair in the opening and lost my balance or slipped while reaching outside the aircraft I would have dropped out of the four story opening onto the concrete below and there would have been a dead flight attendant on the tarmac.The Agent Supervisor would not listen to my safety concerns or to other options. The Inflight Supervisor was never interested in knowing what was going on from our safety perspective on the aircraft and never asked any questions about what was happening on the aircraft. They both forced us into putting our own safety in jeopardy for something that was never going to work in the first place. After the flight the woman that owned the chair came and talked to me. When I told her that the Ramp Agent told me that the battery was dead she said that if they had come and asked her she could have told them that [the battery cables] just come loose and she could have come and reconnected it. She was very upset about our treatment of her and her chair. All this happened because both supervisors were not interested in getting all the information before they made decisions and neither gave one moment's concern for the safety of the crew.,,,,An acrimonious exchange resulted when supervisors from passenger boarding and Inflight Service Departments demanded that a Flight Attendant (the reporter) open the A330's 2R cabin level passenger service door from inside the aircraft in direct violation of the company's Flight Attendant's Operations Manual forbidding doing so; the intended reason being to remove a passenger's electric wheel chair from the aircraft to a catering truck and thence to be boarded in cargo. After compelling the Attendant to do so they discovered the lift vehicle intended to remove the chair was unable to access the door opening.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and Ground Personnel over the improper handling of an electric wheelchair on an aircraft. The Ramp Agent requested the Flight Attendant to open the 2R door from the inside to load the wheelchair onto a catering truck, despite company policy prohibiting such actions. The Agent Supervisor and Inflight Supervisor insisted on the door being opened, ignoring the Flight Attendant's safety concerns and explanations that doors should only be opened from the outside. After the door was opened, it was discovered that the lift vehicle intended to remove the wheelchair could not access the door opening, resulting in a thirty-minute delay. The wheelchair owner later expressed frustration, stating that if consulted, she could have resolved the issue without opening the door. The supervisors failed to consider alternative solutions or safety protocols, unnecessarily putting the Flight Attendant at risk. The incident highlights the importance of adhering to safety procedures and consulting all parties before making decisions that compromise safety.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and other people"

On the flight I smelled the chemicals. Once in our destination when they emptied [the] trash; I could smell it even more because they drench the trash cans with the chemicals. During boarding I got dizzy and my vision became blurred. I talked to another flight attendant and told her. I drank some water and sat down for a minute and ate some pretzels. I became even more nauseated and started to have dry heaves and eventually vomited once in-flight. I notified my Domicile in-flight and Supervisor. I notified union and was told this is a problem and they have tried to stop it for awhile now. I am still nauseated and vomiting and dizzy with blurred vision.They are using cleaning chemicals in the oven and on galley floors and in the galleys. STOP USING THE CLEANER IN THE OVENS ESPECIALLY!

He could not readily identify the odor but said at times it resembled dirty socks.,,,An A319 Lead Flight Attendant became ill from an unknown substance during preflight and subsequently in-flight was nauseous and had blurred vision. Two weeks after the event; he is still off work with symptoms.,"The incident involved a flight attendant who experienced illness after exposure to cleaning chemicals with strong fumes used by ground personnel. The flight attendant encountered the odor during preflight and when emptying trash, leading to dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, dry heaves, and vomiting. Despite measures like drinking water and resting, symptoms persisted, prompting notifications to the domicile, supervisor, and union. The union noted previous attempts to halt the practice, and the flight attendant remained off work two weeks later. A proposed solution was to cease using cleaner in the oven.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, health and medical issues, fume/smoke incident, between attendant and other people"

I called the Aft Flight Attendant in the aft galley and asked her if her crew oxygen compartment was sealed as well (it was). I brought the issue to the attention of the Captain and told him about my concerns and that I did not believe the seals should be there. After a brief discussion; he said he would make a call and let me know. A few minutes later; the Captain told me that he spoke to Dispatch and they told him to tell me to look in my [Flight Attendant] Manual; that a list of approved locations for security seals would be in there. I told him I didn't think such a list was in the Flight Attendant Binder and asked him if Dispatch mentioned where in my binder it might be. He just repeated his prior statement of 'look in your Manual'.I did as instructed; but after several minutes of searching was unable to locate the list that the Captain had mentioned. It was clear that I was not going to get an answer from the Captain on this issue and that I was 'chasing my own tail' looking in the Manual (for something that's not in there) so I called the (city) Inflight Office and spoke with a Supervisor. I explained the situation; however he did not know the answer; but said that he would call Maintenance and call me back ASAP. I told the Captain that I was unable to locate the list in my Manual and I had called Inflight and told him what the Supervisor was doing. The Captain then proceeded to 'chew me out' saying that any call to Maintenance had to go through him first and that I should not have done it the way I did it. I explained to him that I had in fact brought the issue to his attention first and that he essentially blew me off by telling me to find the answer myself. He kept telling me in an accusatory tone that I should not have called Maintenance without speaking to him first; I repeatedly told him that I did not call them; I only called my Supervisor for an answer because I wasn't getting one from him. The conversation was going nowhere; he was just accusing me; and I felt the need to defend myself; so I just stated one last time '(city) Inflight is calling Maintenance' and left the flight deck. A short time later; the Inflight Supervisor called me back and told me that after speaking with Maintenance he determined that the crew oxygen compartments should NOT be sealed. With the Supervisor on the phone; I relayed that information to the Captain. The Captain then asked to speak with my Supervisor; so I handed him the phone. They spoke briefly; and then he hung up. The Captain then told me that the seals should not be there. I asked him; 'Is Maintenance going to come out and remove them; or should I remove them?' He told me to remove the seals; so I did and brought the seals back to him. He then told me that the 'list' he was referring to was not in my Flight Attendant Manual; and again chastised me for 'not consulting him before calling Maintenance'. At that point; I just wanted to be done with the situation; I was tired of his accusations; so I just said 'ok' and left. Several minutes after we closed the [main] entry door; the Captain called back and told me to re-open the forward entry door. Maintenance came onboard to write something in the logbook. As a result of this situation the flight was delayed by 16-minutes. Maintenance needs to pay very close attention to where they are putting those security seals; they must follow all procedures; and also use some common sense and good judgment when performing tasks. If anyone should have a clear understanding of why those compartments should not be sealed shut; it would be a mechanic. Also pilots in general; and this pilot specifically; need to trust and listen to the concerns of their flight attendants. Crewmember's safety related concerns should NEVER be blown off like mine were; no matter how busy you might be.,Reporter stated that when he came onboard a large transport aircraft; the forward and aft flight attendant jumpseat overhead oxygen masks compartments were taped over with company security seals. As far as he knows; the aircraft had flown all day with the O2 mask compartments sealed up. But taping over and restricting automatic deployment of flight attendant oxygen mask compartments at the forward and aft jumpseat locations would result in all three flight attendants not having oxygen available to them; especially during a sudden cabin depressurization. He did not believe there would be enough time for any of the flight attendants to get to a Personal Oxygen Bottle (POB).Not only was there a serious potential for all three flight attendants to become incapacitated; but assisting with any passenger emergency or implementing cabin procedures could also be impacted.,,,A Flight Attendant reports having conflict with a Captain over the cabin crew oxygen mask compartments at the forward and aft flight attendant jumpseat positions on their large transport aircraft having been taped over with security seals.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the captain regarding the presence of security seals on the cabin crew oxygen mask compartments above the forward and aft jumpseats. The flight attendant noticed the compartments were sealed and raised concerns with the captain, who initially instructed her to consult the Flight Attendant Manual for a list of approved locations for the seals. After failing to locate the list, the flight attendant contacted the inflight office supervisor, who then reached out to maintenance. The captain became upset, accusing the flight attendant of contacting maintenance without consulting him first. Despite the flight attendant's clarification that she had sought resolution through proper channels, the captain reprimanded her. Following further communication, maintenance confirmed that the compartments should not be sealed, and the flight attendant removed the seals. The captain reiterated his disapproval, and the flight experienced a 16-minute delay. The incident highlighted the need for maintenance to adhere to proper procedures and for the captain to consider flight attendants' safety concerns more carefully.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

Called Maintenance as the IFE Contractor had put an entry in the logbook as accomplished work card 23-32-00 (ops check system normal). RJAA Maintenance arrived at the gate and I asked him if he could remove the system placard. He called the IFE Technician to the plane who then told me that the system worked but needed further troubleshooting. Logbook items 12; 13; 14 & 16 all addressed parts of the IFE system. Local Maintenance did not clear the IFE placard. Per the MEL 23-10 and NEF 23-33b; I instructed the Purser not to use the IFE system for any of the required passenger safety briefings; or other pre-recorded announcements. After departure; I was made aware that the IFE system was used for the passenger safety demo. Apparently; the Purser decided to use the system after being instructed by me (Captain) not to use this equipment.  AFTER GATE ARRIVAL THE PURSER CAME TO COCKPIT; I DISCUSSED WITH HER THE VIOLATION OF POLICY AND POSSIBLE FAR'S REGARDING USE OF AN AIRCRAFT SYSTEM THAT WAS ON MEL PLACARD; AND THAT THE FINAL AUTHORITY FOR OPERATION OF COMPANY EQUIPMENT RESTS WITH THE CAPTAIN DESIGNATED ON THE FLIGHT RELEASE.  SHE TOLD ME THAT THE MECHANICS; AS THEY LEFT THE AIRCRAFT IN TOKYO; TOLD HER THE SYSTEM WAS FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND TO USE IT.  I POINTED OUT THAT THE CAPTAIN HAS THE LAST SAY REGARDING USE OF EQUIPMENT ON COMPANY AIRCRAFT AND THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE COORDINATED WHAT SHE BELIEVED PROPER USE WITH THE CAPTAIN AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY TOLD HER SPECIFICALLY NOT TO USE THE PRE-RECORDED PORTION OF THE IFE SYSTEM AS IT WAS PLACARDED INOP.,,Captain reviewed the logbook items and spoke to both the Narita Mechanic and two tech reps about the issue. [Captain] then declared that the IFE system would not be used by crew. In the course of the flight; it was discovered that the cabin crew made an attempt to utilize the IFE system which proved unsuccessful. Considering the consequences of an MD-11 accident and other experiences with IFE malfunctions and fires; adherence to Captain's directive needs to trump cabin crew intuition. Additionally; MEL/CDL/NEF guidance concerning placarding is vague and needs to be reduced to plain language with the mutual consent of the company and the FAA. This is the second time I've witnessed a problem involving crews and Maintenance personnel not understanding placarding procedures. This entire situation might've been averted if placarding guidance had clearly stated that an INOP sticker needed to be placed on the ON/OFF switch at the IFE control console.Remind cabin crew of Captain's authority. Simplify guidance for installing INOP stickers for MEL/CDU/NEF items; particularly those in the cabin.,,B777 Captain is informed after the fact that the Purser attempted to use the IFE system for passenger briefing after being advised that it was inoperative on MEL and not to be used.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and the flight attendant regarding the use of an inoperative In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) system on a B777 aircraft. The IFE system was placarded as inoperative (MEL 23-10) and the captain had instructed the purser not to use it for passenger safety briefings or other pre-recorded announcements. Despite this directive, the purser attempted to use the system during the safety briefing, believing it was functional based on communication with maintenance personnel. After the flight, the captain addressed the issue with the purser, emphasizing the captain's authority as the final decision-maker regarding the use of company equipment. The purser argued that maintenance had indicated the system was functional. The captain stressed the importance of adhering to MEL directives and the potential risks associated with using unapproved systems, referencing past incidents involving IFE malfunctions. The incident highlighted a gap in understanding of placarding procedures, with the captain proposing that guidance on MEL/CDL/NEF placarding should be simplified and standardized, particularly for systems in the cabin. Additionally, the captain recommended ensuring cabin crew awareness of the captain's authority and the importance of coordinating with the flight deck before using systems that are placarded inoperative. The B777 captain discovered that the purser had attempted to use the inoperative IFE system for passenger safety briefings despite being explicitly instructed not to do so. The purser believed the system was functional based on communication with maintenance. The captain emphasized the importance of adhering to MEL directives and clarified their authority as the final decision-maker. The incident underscored the need for clearer guidance on placarding procedures and cabin crew coordination with the flight deck.","crew-related issues, equipment malfunction, communication issues, operational issues, training, between attendant and crew"

I was working in Economy. We had just finished setting up the beverage cart to start our service. The turbulence then became moderate. Coffee was coming out of the pots; water bottles were rocking back and forth as were we; in the back of the aircraft. The other Aft Flight Attendant called the flight deck and spoke to the Captain and asked him to turn on the seatbelt sign; as we were unstable in the rear of the aircraft. The Captain said 'no' and refused to turn on the seatbelt sign. Both aft flight attendants were shocked at his response. She hung up the phone; not knowing what to say at this point. It was at this time a passenger was exiting the most rear lavatory. She had to hang on to the assist handle as she could not make it back to her seat. I then called the Captain; introduced myself and said; 'Captain this is the back. I don't think you are aware of how bumpy it is back here. Could you please turn on the seatbelt sign?' He then answered; 'I am in control of the seatbelt sign and I am not turning it on.' I then said; 'Are you kidding?' I thought he was being sarcastic and could not believe that he was questioning our judgment. Both aft flight attendants could not understand or believe his response. We then notified the Purser of what had taken place. I then talked with a deadheading pilot who was seated in the last seat position 'F.' I asked him if I was being unreasonable and how best to communicate with this pilot. He was also shocked at this pilot's response to our request. We considered our own safety needs and did not start the service until we felt comfortable. During the service; while it was perfectly smooth; the Captain came on the PA and asked the flight attendants to be seated. Both aft flight attendants looked at each other as we could not believe what he was asking. When we got to the rear galley; we stowed the carts and sat in our jumpseats. We called the Purser to find out what was going on. The Captain had not communicated anything to her prior and it was only after she called him; he mentioned there might be turbulence up ahead. We sat for approximately 15 minutes with NO turbulence. Both aft flight attendants felt that this pilot was not concerned with our well being and/or safety; or the passengers. This is a safety issue and our respect for this Captain was lost when he gave the response he did. We also then did not trust him or his judgment throughout the flight and was actually contemplating that he was purposely being erratic and irresponsible. His behavior conveyed a complete lack of concern for our safety and our passenger's safety. I would feel extremely uncomfortable ever flying with this Captain again.,,,,A A320 Aft Flight Attendant asked the Captain during turbulance to turn the seat belt sign ON; but he refused. When asked a second time by the Lead Flight Attendant he responded 'I am in control and not turning it on.' The crew was in disbelief and distrusting.,"The incident occurred during a flight involving an A320 aircraft. Approximately 15-20 minutes after takeoff, moderate turbulence was experienced in the rear of the aircraft. The Aft Flight Attendant requested the Captain to turn on the seatbelt sign due to the instability, but the Captain refused, stating, ""I am in control of the seatbelt sign and I am not turning it on."" The flight attendant, along with the other Aft Flight Attendant, expressed disbelief and concern over the Captain's response, feeling it disregarded their safety and that of the passengers. The flight attendants deferred to a deadheading pilot for guidance, who also expressed shock at the Captain's refusal. Fearing for their safety, the flight attendants delayed service until conditions stabilized. Later, the Captain instructed the flight attendants to sit down via the public address system, despite the absence of turbulence at the time. The flight attendants felt the Captain's actions demonstrated a lack of concern for their safety and the passengers', leading to a loss of respect and trust in his judgment. The flight attendants considered the behavior a serious safety issue and stated they would feel uncomfortable flying with the Captain again. No resolution was explicitly proposed in the incident.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

Discussed the light with the Captain and because of the likelihood of a long delay in ZZZ; we elected to come to ZZZ1 and report the light 'On'. In ZZZ1; Maintenance found enough debris that the aircraft was removed from service to flush the oil system and recheck for debris. [Contributors]:1) There is no guidance for the flight crew regarding the chip detector. It is not part of the normal preflight inspection but the light is obvious if 'On'. Without guidance there is confusion as to whether this is something we should check or even be concerned about if it is 'On'. 2) The most common time to find this light 'On'; is during the first flight of the day preflight which is usually at an outstation. Due to the difficulty of getting Maintenance to the Outstation and the likelihood of a lengthy delay; it is difficult to convince myself; much less the Captain; that we should report the problem at the Outstation. This is the second time in the last two months I have delayed reporting the light 'On' to avoid delay at the Outstation. This is the first time out of six previous that required more than a simple cleaning of the detector.

Maintenance at a downline Station found enough debris in chip detector to remove aircraft from service. Pilot noted that unclear guidance on chip detector light and on-time departure pressures were contributors.,"The incident involved a First Officer who reported that the Left-Hand (LH) Chip Detector Light was illuminated during the preflight inspection of their CRJ-200 aircraft. After discussing the issue with the Captain, they decided to divert to ZZZ1 due to concerns about potential delays at the outstation. Upon arrival, Maintenance discovered sufficient debris in the chip detector, leading to the aircraft being removed from service for oil system flushing and reinspection. Contributors to the incident included the lack of clear guidelines for flight crew regarding the chip detector light, which is not part of the standard preflight inspection. The First Officer noted that the light frequently illuminated during the first flight of the day at outstations, and the difficulty of obtaining timely Maintenance support at remote locations compounded the decision to delay reporting. This was the second occurrence in two months, with the first five instances requiring only a simple cleaning of the detector. To prevent future occurrences, the First Officer recommended the establishment of clear guidelines for flight crew actions when the chip detector light is illuminated, aiming to address confusion and reduce the risk of similar incidents.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, fume/smoke incident, training, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

The clearance consisted of 'Taxi to Runway 4R' via Bravo and Juliette. After receiving the clearance; and prior to taxi; I confirmed with the First Officer and verified the taxi clearance with the airport diagram. We started moving straight ahead via Bravo and momentarily stopped on 4L to do our normal safety visual clearance (Left and Right) and then; continued taxi toward Juliette. After reaching Juliette; and turning right; we stopped before crossing Runway 11. When we stopped; we received a call from Ground Control with a possible Pilot deviation; and they also gave us a phone number to contact them. After the call; we received clearance to cross Runway 11 and continue Taxi to 4R. At the end of the runway; on the holding short area; I called the Tower. They informed me that we crossed 4L without clearance.We never had the intention to cross any active runway. However; with the clearance that we received (and verified with the airport diagram); we understood that we were clear to taxi all the way to 4R; including crossing the Runways (4L and 11). Apparently; my First Officer misunderstood the taxi clearance because; usually the normal taxi clearance instructions are 'Taxi Runway 4R via Bravo and hold short Runway 4L.' After that; we usually receive further clearance.  In my opinion; since Juliette Taxiway is at the end of Bravo; and prior to Juliette is Runway 4L; when we received the clearance instructions the way we got them; it became confusing and created an involuntary error. Again; we understood; we were cleared to taxi to Runway 4R; via Bravo and Juliette.,,,,An air carrier crew cleared to LFT Runway 4R taxied all the way to the Runway crossing Runway 4L but stopping prior to Runway 11 because they thought the taxi clearance included crossing intervening runways.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant (Party1) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) at Lafayette Airport. The flight attendant reported receiving taxi clearance to Runway 4R via Bravo and Juliette. After confirming the clearance with the first officer and referencing the airport diagram, the crew began taxiing. They momentarily stopped on Runway 4L for safety checks and continued toward Juliette. Upon reaching Juliette and turning right, they stopped before crossing Runway 11 and received a call from Ground Control regarding a possible deviation. Ground Control provided a phone number and later cleared the crew to cross Runway 11 and proceed to Runway 4R. Upon reaching the holding short area, the Tower informed the crew that they had crossed Runway 4L without clearance. The flight attendant stated that the crew had intended to follow the taxi clearance as understood, which they believed included crossing intervening runways. The flight attendant attributed the misunderstanding to the taxi clearance instructions, which they claimed were ambiguous and different from the usual format (""Taxi Runway 4R via Bravo and hold short Runway 4L""). The first officer reportedly misapplied the instructions, leading to the unintended crossing of Runway 4L. The crew ultimately followed the corrected instructions and resolved the situation without further incident.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, emergency, between attendant and other people"

After the [onboard] services; the crews have been putting aluminum cans in the New Tech electrical [food] carts. When I made this known to the [more experienced] flight attendant crews; the response was negative and I quote that their response is 'This is what we have always done.' I am considered a Junior Flight Attendant. The carts have shown malfunction from the collaboration of the aluminum and electrical appliances. If abused it can cause other malfunctions to the electrical system(s) of the aircraft. ALL New Tech Carts hold HEAT!!!! When aluminum is introduced to the hot electrical plates it can cause an explosion. I was told that they do it because they are not going to plug the carts back up to the electrical [cord.] But what happens when the next crew uses the carts? The [residue] cannot be washed away. I believe that is what they think; or burned away using the integrity of the airplanes electrical heating systems. AGAIN; this has been practiced numerous times. My response is I am not stupid to the following working crew. And they wonder why we have mechanical problems with the planes. The [aluminum] can explode if they continue to practice this method [or] attitude.,Reporter stated the New Tech Carts can chill or heat food. Switches for the cooling or heating of carts are located at the Galley's upper panel. Only the Aft Galley on their B747's currently use the New Tech Carts. An electrical cord from each cart is connected to another cord supplying electrical power for heat or cold. Older carts were either chiller or hot carts; not both.Reporter stated her concern was the potential for the used aluminum cans to melt on the heating pads and releasing mercury or some other fumes. Heating pads are believed to be made of a ceramic/metal material. Another concern was the lack of training for many of the flight attendants who just don't understand how the New Tech Cart's function. Many times she has found flight attendants trying to heat food while they also had the chiller switch 'On' and complaining the heater was not working. Reporter noted she has nineteen years flying experience.,,,A Flight Attendant describes the potential for electrical malfunctions caused by stowage of empty aluminum cans in the New Tech Cart food trays and the lack of training for the proper operation of the carts on B747-400 aircraft.,"The incident involved a conflict between two flight attendants regarding the improper storage of empty aluminum cans in the New Tech electrical carts used for heating and cooking meals on a B747-400 aircraft. The junior flight attendant reported that storing aluminum cans in the carts could lead to electrical malfunctions, explosions, or residue buildup that might harm future operations. Despite their concerns, the more experienced flight attendants dismissed the issue, stating it was a longstanding practice. The junior attendant emphasized the safety risks and lack of proper training on the aircraft's electrical systems, expressing frustration over what they perceived as unsafe habits contributing to mechanical issues. The incident highlighted a potential safety hazard and called for improved training on the proper use of the carts.","crew-related issues, safety related, between attendant and crew, operational issues, training"

When I answered I received a very loud and frantic voice repeating this 'XXXX; XXXX; we must land immediately.' I tried to gain more information to no avail. I declared an emergency and asked for a return to the airport. When asked what the nature of the emergency was; I stated that is was unclear; however; it could be a fire type of situation. During the 180 degree turn back we received a second chime and got the same verbiage from the flight attendants. 'XXXX; XXXX; we must land immediately.' Soon thereafter I took the control of the airplane and radios and asked the First Officer to get more information from the back. We eventually found out that is was an ill passenger who was having a heart attack and CPR was being administered. I then stated to ATC what type of emergency we had and entered a downwind for the landing runway.The phrase 'XXXX' is mentioned one time in our operations manual. It is a Flight Attendant to Flight Attendant reference only. Simple English; with details; need to be used when describing a situation in the cabin of the airplane. Due to the severity of the ill passenger (heart attack; no pulse; no breathing and CPR being done) the flight attendants were under a lot of stress. They performed very well and I would like to acknowledge they probably saved this mans life! GREAT JOB! However; I feel there needs to be much more awareness of the fact that we are not privy to or trained in some of their references; acronyms etc. My perception of what was maybe a fire or other [question of airworthiness] type of situation; even though for a very short time; is very concerning due to the [lack of specificity] from the flight attendants.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported a passenger had a heart attack shortly after takeoff; an emergency was declared and the flight returned to the departure airport.  Captain stated the flight attendants were utilizing unique to the flight attendant group language to describe the situation which resulted in an inaccurate assessment of the needs between the flight crew and ATC.,"The incident occurred shortly after takeoff when a flight attendant used an internal code (""XXXX"") to signal an emergency to the flight crew. The flight crew, unfamiliar with this code, perceived it as a serious situation such as a fire, leading them to declare an emergency and return to the departure airport. Upon landing, it was discovered that the emergency involved a passenger experiencing a heart attack, with flight attendants administering CPR. The flight crew praised the attendants' quick response but highlighted the confusion caused by the internal jargon. To prevent future misunderstandings, it was proposed to enhance training and awareness regarding the use of such codes among all crew members.","crew-related issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew, health and medical issues"

While walking down the jet bridge the inbound crew informed the four of us flight attendants that we have a mechanical.  They discovered a missing portion of the Emergency Lighting strip on the floor by Row-12 and wrote it up.  They said that it is a 'No-Go' item.  When I boarded the B757-200 airplane; I immediately went to Row-12 to see the missing lighting strip.  It was plain to see that the strip was missing.  My three flying partners all saw it as well and noted it's nothing we have ever seen before. Soon a Maintenance employee was on board examining the area.  I walked up to him and started a discussion about the missing strip. He began to explain to me how the lighting strip is NOT missing; that merely the portion of carpet in that area is what's missing.  I was quite surprised by his explanation and assertively shared my complete disagreement for his assessment.  How; if the pilots were to turn on the emergency lighting that the missing portion would not light up at all; and that is not normal.  To further prove my point I told him I was going to ask the pilots to turn on the lighting so he could see for himself.  I then walked up to the cockpit and asked the Captain if they could turn on the emergency lights so he could walk back with me and also tell the Mechanic that the missing portion does in fact exist and that it is not normal.  Captain then instructed the First Officer to turn on the lighting so he could walk back with me to see the missing lighting strip. When the emergency lights were on; the lighting strip went from a lit strip to dark carpet by Row-12 then to a lit strip again.  I motioned to both the Mechanic and Captain how that is not 'normal' and it's a safety issue.  The Mechanic dismissed my comment as he continued with his explanation to the Captain how the plane is DESIGNED this way.  I was astounded.  I assertively stated that the incoming crew knew this wasn't normal; which is why they wrote it up.  I and my three flying partners have never seen a missing lighting strip before and knew it wasn't normal; and now I'm to believe that Boeing designed their 757s with a missing lighting strip by Row 12?!  The Captain said if the Mechanic is okay with it; then he is too.  I took a picture of the missing portion by Row-12 (and happened to get the Captains feet in the picture.)  The Mechanic left the plane and came back about ten minutes later.  When he returned he told me that he went to a nearby gate where another B757 [aircraft] was parked and examined Row-12 on that plane and how that plane also had the same missing strip by Row-12.  He showed pictures of that planes missing strip as well.  I responded by telling the Mechanic that simply because another plane has a missing strip that doesn't necessarily mean it's normal and doesn't need to be addressed and/or fixed.  How again the inbound crew knew to report it; how the current crew knows it's not normal and how I'm not okay with it missing due to it being a safety issue. Although I don't have Captain's authority to make a final decision about it; yet I made it known my own level of discomfort with it as it's an obvious potential safety issue.  If we had to evacuate upon landing in ZZZ1; that area [of the cabin floor] would not have lit up; especially since we landed late at night. To further my correct stance on this issue; we worked on another B757 the following day out of ZZZ1.  The four of us flight attendants were quick to notice a fully intact lighting strip by Row-12 on this plane.  We also happened to have the same cockpit crew Captain and First Officer.  I told the Captain that this plane does have the lighting strip by Row-12; how the plane is not designed to have a missing portion of the strip and that it should have been fixed on our plane yesterday.  I did not receive a receptive response.I cannot help but feel that our safety was not a priority on this flight.  Either the Mechanic didn't want to fix the missing strip or he somehow knew that they didn't have a replacement to fix the strip which would have caused a significant delay or potential cancellation of my flight.  Regardless; no excuse should be given for allowing this plane to fly the manner in which it did. I felt as though my opinion didn't matter; didn't count and wasn't professionally regarded with the priority it should have been given.  If safety is our Air Carrier's number one corporate value; they fell very short with me and my crew and all the passengers on this flight. Worked First Class [section].,,,,A Flight Attendant working as a Purser; describes her efforts to address cabin egress safety issues after being informed that a section of the cabin floor Emergency Lighting strip was missing on their outbound B757 aircraft.,"The incident involved a Purser on a flight from ZZZ-ZZZ1 who was informed by the inbound crew about a missing portion of the Emergency Lighting strip in Row-12, classified as a 'No-Go' item. Upon boarding, she confirmed the missing strip, which her crew also deemed unusual. She discussed the issue with a maintenance employee, who claimed the carpet was missing instead of the lighting strip. The Purser demonstrated the safety risk by having the pilots activate the emergency lights, revealing a dark area where the strip was missing. Despite her evidence, the mechanic and captain dismissed her concerns, with the captain deferring to the mechanic. The Purser took a photo and later found another B757 with the same issue. She argued that the problem warranted attention but felt her concerns were disregarded. The next day, on a different B757 with an intact strip, she again highlighted the inconsistency, but her feedback was not addressed. She expressed dissatisfaction with the handling of the issue, feeling her safety concerns were overlooked, and questioned the prioritization of safety.","safety related, operational issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

I explained that although the company and its pilots have been using this as standard practice to give customers more time to use the onboard WiFi that it was in violation of both company (manual) policy as well as a violation of two FARs. I thought that we had the situation under control until we hit the bumps and the Captain told us that he was sitting us down but the customers could continue to use all electronic devices. We only have a secure cabin or an unsecure cabin. Our flight landed unsecure. The customers had tray tables back down and all electronics on. Had an evacuation happened; customers would have wasted great amounts of time trying to get around all the laptops and other electronic devices.,,,,A flight attendant reported that the company and its pilots are colluding to seat flight attendants early when turbulence is expected on landing but allow passengers to continue using onboard WiFi until descending through 10;000 MSL. Flight attendants thus are precluded from making their pre-landing checks of passenger compliance with safety regulations. The reporter believes the result is aircraft landing unsecured as passengers continue to utilize electronic devices and leave tray tables down; contrary to regulations.,"The incident involved a disagreement between a flight attendant and the flight crew regarding safety protocols during expected turbulence. The flight attendant raised concerns that the practice of seating flight attendants early during pre-flight, while allowing passengers to continue using onboard WiFi until descending through 10,000 feet, violated company policy and Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs). The flight attendant argued that this practice prevented them from conducting necessary pre-landing safety checks, potentially leaving the cabin unsecured upon landing. The flight attendant noted that passengers' tray tables remained down and electronic devices were in use, which could obstruct an evacuation in the event of an emergency. The flight landed unsecured, and the attendant emphasized that this practice posed a significant safety risk. The flight attendant proposed correcting the policy and protocol violations to ensure compliance with safety regulations.","safety related, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

After further investigation found Circuit Breakers (CB) # L5; X25; Z24 and the entire Ground Service Bus inoperative. All other electrical indications were normal.  Sign-off was;  Removed and Replaced (R/R) Battery Charger IAW Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 24-30-02. Reset circuit breakers. Operational Check (Ops) [was] normal.

Also; while talking with the crew; they stated that ZZZ had lots of rain the night before; and lots of condensation that morning in the aircraft. I believe that any water that came from the overhead area of the aircraft was the result of condensation in the aircraft Air Ventilation System.    Due to the discussions we had that day; I believed that the statement about water coming from the overhead areas was more of information into the discrepancy that needed to be investigated and not a discrepancy itself that needed to be addressed; in the action taken block in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook (AML).  Don't assume any information in the [Logbook] Discrepancy block doesn't need to be addressed in the [Logbook's] Action Taken block.,,,,A Line Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT) explains why he did not state in a Logbook sign-off that he had also checked the cabin overhead panels; floors and the E/E compartment for evidence of water intrusion after he had Removed and Replaced (R/R) a Battery Charger.

A Flight Attendant reported water coming from the overhead area, prompting an investigation. Circuit breakers L5, X25, Z24, and the Ground Service Bus were found inoperative, though other electrical systems functioned normally. The Line Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT) addressed the issue by replacing the Battery Charger per the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM), resetting the circuit breakers, and conducting operational checks, which were normal. The AMT did not document checking the overhead panels, floors, or E/E compartment for water in the logbook's Action Taken block, as no evidence of water intrusion was found. The AMT believed the water was likely due to condensation from rain and humidity the previous night. Despite this, the AMT emphasized that the logbook's Discrepancy block should not be assumed to require no action in the Action Taken block. The aircraft was cleared for service following the maintenance.","equipment malfunction, operational issues, crew-related issues, fume/smoke incident, between attendant and crew"

Continued the QRH and landed with the Left engine at idle.  We did Declare an Emergency.  Because of where the event began; passing 21;000 FT; we were very busy running checklists and preparing for the approach.  We finally completed all checklists and the approach briefing at approximately 4;000 feet on a five mile base for the runway.During the post flight discussion with the crew; the Flight Attendant noted that we had failed to provide the signal for descent through 10;000 FT.  It seems that we omitted this step due to task saturation.  This is an easy miss as the cabin advisory is no longer a checklist item.  This 10;000 FT signal seems to be omitted fairly regularly and is especially likely to be omitted during an abnormal event.  This problem could be alleviated if we reinstated the cabin notification in the Descent and Approach Checklist.,,,,Preoccupied with abnormal procedures generated by a bleed air duct temperature warning; the Flight Crew of a CRJ-200 failed to broadcast the alert to the Flight Attendants as they passed through 10;000 FT MSL as required by their company SOP.,"The incident involved a CRJ-200 flight crew and a flight attendant. During the flight, the crew encountered a 14th stage Bleed Air Duct warning, which led them to follow the QRH procedures, including selecting wings and cowls off and closing the left 14th stage bleed air. They declared an emergency and landed safely with the left engine at idle. Due to their focus on abnormal procedures and checklist management, the crew failed to provide the required cabin signal for descent through 10,000 FT as per the company's Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The flight attendant noted this omission during a post-flight discussion. The missed signal was attributed to task saturation, as the cabin advisory is no longer a checklist item and is often omitted, especially during abnormal events. To address this issue, it was suggested that the cabin notification be reinstated in the Descent and Approach Checklist to reduce the likelihood of such omissions in the future.","equipment malfunction, operational issues, safety related, crew-related issues, training, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

Nothing was ever said to me about Air Marshals on the flight. This flight had FAA Inspector on board; who works in the Certificate Management Office. The problem began when the agent started the boarding process without consulting with the flight attendants. Passengers arrived at the airplane; catching the flight attendants off guard. The FAA Inspector actually held the passengers on the jet bridge while the flight attendants scrambled to prepare the airplane. FAA Inspector apparently confronted the ticket agent and; according to the Inspector; the ticket agent copped an attitude. A few minutes later an armed FBI agent appeared at the cockpit door to show me his ID. I had no paper work on the individual and he said the ticket agent had my copy of the paper work. A few minutes later a DEA agent arrived at the airplane; and this time the ticket agent had sent my paper work with the DEA agent. I asked the DEA agent if he was aware of the Air Marshals and the FBI agent that were also on the flight; and he said he knew about the FBI agent; but not the Air Marshals. I immediately called for a supervisor to come to the plane. I explained the situation to the supervisor and he apologized for the mix up and said he would take care of the issue. A few minutes later another ticket agent came into the cockpit and I asked if the LEOs had met the Air Marshals. He said there were no Air Marshals on board. Then the original ticket agent came to the cockpit and I asked him if there were any Air Marshals on board. He said 'no'. One of the ticket agents went back to the gate counter and returned to the airplane a few minutes later and told me there were indeed two Air Marshals on board. Knowing that the two LEO's did not know of the Air Marshals; I instructed the ticket agent to inform all four armed individuals of each other. (Which he did). The flight departed 13 minutes late with no further issues. FAA Inspector said he would be investigating the events on this flight which has prompted me to submit this report.,,,,Armed Federal Agents and Law Enforcement Officers boarded aircraft without proper notification to the crew and or knowledge of each others presence.,"An incident occurred when multiple armed federal agents boarded a flight without prior notification to the crew, resulting in confusion and a delayed departure. The agents included an FAA Inspector, FBI agent, DEA agent, and two Air Marshals. The boarding process began without consulting the flight attendants, who were unprepared, causing a delay as passengers were held on the jet bridge. Communication issues led to the flight attendant being unaware of all law enforcement personnel initially. After an FBI agent and DEA agent arrived, the flight attendant sought a supervisor, who apologized and resolved the confusion by informing all agents of each other's presence. The flight departed 13 minutes late, with the FAA Inspector initiating an investigation.","crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people"

He said that this would be a normal landing and I rephrased it as a question 'we should prepare the cabin for a normal landing?' and his answer was; 'Yes.' The call ended shortly after. The airplane began to descend shortly after an announcement to the passengers from the pilots. The landing gear was extended much earlier than usual before landing. Upon landing a number of fire personnel met the aircraft off the runway. Although emergency fire personnel were in the jet bridge; the passengers deplaned normally. Shortly after landing the pilots went below the aircraft to inspect something under the wing. [Since I was] not being given much information; I discussed the event with the fire and Maintenance personnel. The issue they described was much more severe in nature than I was told on the aircraft. According to Maintenance the light/message that came on indicated the possible loss of critical aircraft systems and could have been catastrophic if failure did occur on landing. This incident indicated serious problems on the aircraft that sounded; to me; like an emergency; i.e. 'Any event in which the safe operation of the flight is in doubt.' When the pilots returned from inspecting the aircraft I asked; 'What were you looking at?' The Captain replied; 'Nothing.' There was no official debriefing after the event by the Captain. The First Officer did try to inform us about what occurred; but the Captain seemed to be keeping him from speaking with us. After the event the pilots had a couple of extensive private conversations in the back of the aircraft when the only other people onboard were the other Flight Attendant and me. The failure here on the part of the Captain is addressed in our Flight Attendant Manual (FAM). 'The PIC will ensure the flight attendants are advised as to the extent of the emergency or irregular operation.' None of the SOP briefing items were discussed and they should have been as this was; at the very least; an abnormal situation. The time between the Captain's call to me and our landing would have been more than sufficient to prepare the cabin for an abnormal landing. As stated in our manual; 'In an emergency; flight attendants are responsible for ensuring the safety of the passengers and preserving the integrity of the cabin.' With the information provided and the attitude of the Captain appearing to discourage communication; I did not feel I could do so. There was a critical failure of the communication process between crew members of this event. There was a lack of CRM during this abnormal/emergency situation. Throughout the whole beginning of the trip the Captain acted like it was a large strain to communicate with us and that attitude extended into this emergency situation in the air. The cabin crew and passengers were given identical sets of information over the PA and even the experienced fliers onboard knew something was not right. I had quite a few people ask me directly; 'We could tell the pilot was lying; what really happened?' and my honest answer was that I was not given any other information.,,,,A Flight Attendant aboard an ERJ-170 reported the Captain failed to properly brief and prepare the aircraft for what the reporter later determined had been a possibly serious anomaly for which the flight diverted to a nearby airport where they were met by CFR and maintenance personnel.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant aboard an ERJ-170 who reported that the Captain failed to properly brief and prepare the cabin crew for an emergency situation. The flight was diverted to a nearby airport due to a message alert indicating a potential loss of critical aircraft systems, which could have been catastrophic. Despite the severity of the situation, the Captain provided insufficient information to the cabin crew, did not follow standard operating procedures (SOP) for emergencies, and appeared to discourage communication with the flight attendants. This led to a breakdown in communication and a lack of Crew Resource Management (CRM) during the abnormal situation. After landing, maintenance personnel revealed that the issue was more severe than initially communicated. The Captain's failure to debrief the cabin crew and the First Officer's apparent restraint from sharing information further exacerbated the situation. The Flight Attendant noted that the lack of transparency and poor communication strained the crew's ability to ensure passenger safety and maintain cabin integrity.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, emergency, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

I say what for I am not on reserve. I also say; how can I do that we are ready to leave the main cabin door is closed. The Captain states it is OK we are now on maintenance. I changed positions with B and retrieve my phone and turn it on even though the entire cabin has their phones off. Crew Scheduling stated there had been a change to my scheduling. I tell them that I am not on reserve. They say they know that. I tell them I won't do it. We continue to talk and then I ask for the Supervisor of Crew Scheduling. The Supervisor tells me tells me there is no one else; I am within duty regulations at that I need to do this. I tell her we are on maintenance and to get a reserve out there as we are now waiting for Maintenance to arrive and take the flight. I request to speak to a Duty Officer. The Duty Officer is unable to speak with me as now we are leaving. I listen to the Duty Officer message after landing asking me please; to save the flight for these people. There is a huge lack of communication. Upon arrival there is an injured Flight Attendant in a wheelchair. Against my own better judgment I do the flight. We landed after midnight. During the flight I truly realize that I am not safe to do the flight. I am exhausted over the turbulence and sleep deprivation. Flight Attendant B who was in the previous turbulence that downed the aircraft states that her neck is stiff and that she probably should not have flown the flight either. I felt pushed by the Company to take one for the team knowing it was not a safe situation for me.,,,,A Q400 Flight Attendant felt forced to work an additional flight after her normal sequence because of another flight attendant's injury but realized later that she was fatigued to the point of not being safe.,"A Q400 flight attendant was pressured by the airline to work an additional flight after her normal sequence concluded due to another flight attendant's injury. Despite expressing exhaustion and fatigue, including concerns about safety during turbulence and sleep deprivation, the attendant felt compelled to fulfill the duty, citing a lack of communication and support from the company. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and support systems to ensure crew safety and prevent similar situations in the future.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

We followed the appropriate procedures and declared an emergency with ATC and landed the aircraft successfully. During the Flight Attendant briefing I informed them of the condition of the aircraft and the time remaining to landing; however; I missed a couple of items. Specifically I should have given them a better brief on what to expect once we landed and after the aircraft came to a stop.After landing I announced 'Flight Attendants to their stations'. Some time later; only after CFR had inspected the aircraft; did I then announce that they should 'Remain Seated' as we taxied to the gate.After I gave the emergency brief in flight; I turned the cabin volume control down. I thought I turned it down all the way; but I did not. After the aircraft came to a stop I could hear the conversation between Flight Attendants. It sounded like they were confused about being on the runway and what was taking so long for further instructions from me. I was concerned that they would evacuate the aircraft with so much time not hearing from the flight deck once the airplane was on the ground. Overhearing what sounded like confused conversation between them I decided that; if there is a next time; I will give a more detailed brief to the Flight Attendants on what to expect on the ground.,,,,An A319 Captain discussed what he believed to be his incomplete briefing given to the Flight Attendants to prepare them for what would happen after landing when he had declared an emergency due to faulty flaps/slats. He cited his failure to keep them regularly informed as to their status and the progress of exterior inspections by CFR personnel.,"The incident involved an A319 flight where the flight crew declared an emergency due to a flap/slat fault during approach. The captain successfully landed the aircraft but acknowledged providing an incomplete briefing to the flight attendants regarding the post-landing procedures and the status of exterior inspections by ground personnel. After landing, the captain instructed the flight attendants to return to their stations but did not immediately inform them to remain seated until the aircraft was safely taxied to the gate. The captain later realized that the cabin volume control had not been fully turned down, allowing him to overhear the flight attendants' confused conversations about the delay in receiving further instructions. This led the captain to recognize the need for a more detailed briefing in the future to ensure the flight attendants were better prepared for such situations.","crew-related issues, emergency, between attendant and crew"

At this time; I realized that the front entry door and cockpit doors remained open. I proceeded to walk forward to inquire. When I arrived to the forward galley; a caterer came from the rear of the aircraft and informed us that he had popped the slide. We inquired if he was injured; and he said no. I followed him to the aft galley as he told me that he had seen the orange strap; but that his sunglasses had been giving off a glare and he had opened the door anyway. The slide had been fully deployed and was facing upward at an angle as the door was only partially opened. The gate agent; the caterer; and I placed the slide inside the aft galley so the plane could be taken to another gate and a new plane brought to our current gate. We immediately contacted the Captain and began to secure another aircraft; deplane passengers; and continue our flight. The entire procedure was done effectively and efficiently and we departed less than 50 minutes late and all connections were good.I am eternally thankful that no one was injured due to my misunderstanding and know in the future I will be on high alert and double check myself. In this job; there are so many things going on at once in an attempt to board passengers; stow their bags; do our duties and depart on time. Sometimes; I get caught up in repetitive routines like simply shutting the doors and preparing for the demo that I have neglected a very important aspect. I should have immediately returned to the aft galley and 'unprepared' my doors as soon as I saw the forward entry door was open. As for the caterer; thankfully he was not injured; however; I would hope in the future he will never attempt to open a door with the strap across the window.,,,,An emergency exit slide was deployed at the gate by a caterer when a Flight Attendant incorrectly understood the order to arm the doors had been given.,"The incident occurred when a Flight Attendant misunderstood an order to arm the doors, leading to an emergency exit slide being deployed at the gate by a caterer. The Flight Attendant believed they had heard the Lead Flight Attendant instruct to ""prepare doors"" and proceeded to check the cabin. Upon reaching the forward galley, they discovered the front entry door and cockpit doors were open. A caterer approached and explained that they had intentionally opened the forward entry door, mistaking the orange safety strap for a signal to deploy the slide due to sunglass glare. The slide was fully deployed and facing upward, creating an obstruction. The Flight Attendant, along with the caterer and gate agent, secured the slide, moved the aircraft to another gate, and coordinated with ground staff to bring a replacement aircraft. Passengers were deplaned, and the flight resumed less than 50 minutes after the initial delay. No injuries were reported, and the situation was handled efficiently. The Flight Attendant acknowledged the importance of double-checking procedures and expressed gratitude for the positive outcome. The caterer was unharmed but was advised against such actions in the future.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, emergency, weather related, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people"

Normal departure out of TEB [and] at 1;000 FT AGL engaged the autopilot. Autopilot flew the SID properly [and] leveled off 1;500 FT on a 240 degree heading. Autopilot turned aircraft towards 280 degree heading; but failed to stop and continued another 20-30 degrees. I disconnected autopilot immediately to turn back to 280 degree heading. At the same time ATC instructed us to expedite climb to 6;000 FT. My First Officer answered the call and I began to climb. In the same transmission ATC also instructed us to turn right direct to BREZY. My First Officer responded to that and directed the FMS to take us to BREZY. As we made the turn and climb; ATC questioned us as to where we were going and [told us] that we should be on a 280 degree heading. I immediately turned back to 280 degrees. My First Officer responded; 'You gave us direct to BREZY.' ATC responded that he was sorry he missed the incorrect read back and not to worry; it was his mistake. He said he had asked us to expedite the climb and to 'expect a right turn direct BREZY.' A contributing factor to the miscommunication was the busyness of the frequency workload on the Controller; the aural warning of the autopilot disconnect causing additional noise in the headset for my First Officer; as well as the FMS and autopilot incorrectly flying the SID. A corrective action would be for ATC not to accept an incorrect read back in such a crucial phase of flight. I will [also] hand fly the SID form now on. Discouraging as it is; I will not trust the approved FMS and autopilot to actually fly the SID. Had this situation not occurred at this inopportune time; both my First Officer and I would have taken a moment to question the instructions given.,,,,PC12 Captain experiences an autopilot malfunction during the TEB 6 departure; resulting in a track deviation. A second deviation occurs when the crew is told to expect direct BREZY and reads back cleared direct BREZY.,"The incident involved an autopilot malfunction during the departure of a PC12 aircraft from TEB, leading to a track deviation. The autopilot failed to stop at the correct heading, prompting the captain to disconnect it. Subsequently, the crew received ATC instructions to expedite climb and turn right direct to BREZY. However, the crew incorrectly read back the instructions as ""cleared direct to BREZY,"" which ATC later acknowledged was their mistake due to workload and miscommunication. Contributing factors included the controller's busy frequency, the autopilot's aural warning causing headset noise, and the FMS and autopilot's incorrect handling of the SID. As a result, the captain decided to hand-fly the SID in the future, distrusting the FMS and autopilot. ATC was advised to avoid accepting incorrect readbacks during critical phases of flight.","safety related, equipment malfunction, communication issues, operational issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and other people"

The aircraft also had one MEL; the APU was inoperative; so we had to do an external air start at the gate. While taxiing to the runway; we performed a cross bleed start on the number one engine. Everything was normal during the taxi; beside the aircraft getting warm while using the bleed air to operate the air conditioning packs.We were in the takeoff roll; well past 80 KTS and approaching V1 when we received a call chime from the Flight Attendant. I was the pilot flying and decided to continue the takeoff; as we were within a few KTS of V1. While I was rotating the aircraft; we received a second call from the Flight Attendant using the cabin emergency call button. After raising the gear and configuring the aircraft; the First Officer answered the call. She said; 'There's smoke in the cabin; down the floor aisle.' We immediately informed Tower of the situation and that we would like to return. At the same time; the Flight Attendant called back saying she was seeing smoke coming out from along the aisle; down around where the emergency lights are. I asked her if it smelled like smoke; a burning smell; or an electrical smell. She went to investigate and then call us back.We were still on the SID and I had started to level off back down to 3;000 FT.The Flight Attendant called back and said that there is no smell at all; the smoke is like a mist; and it is cold air coming out. Tower at this time asked us if we would like to land on [Runway] XXR or YYR. We informed the Tower that we were still analyzing the problem; so he sent us to Departure. We contacted Departure and he had us fly heading 185 degrees and climb to 4;000 FT.The Flight Attendant called us to say that the smoke had gone away; but as soon as I added thrust to climb to 4;000 FT the smoke reappeared. I asked if there was any smell again and she said no; and [that] it was still cold air coming out. All this happened in a very short time frame. At this time we realized that it was not smoke; but condensation coming from the air conditioning packs. We had received no indications of anything abnormal in the cockpit; no EICAS messages; and all readings on the systems page of the MFD were normal. The cabin was warm and humid from the taxi out; so the temperature control was set to cold on the Flight Attendant control panel.At this point; Departure asked us what we wanted to do. We talked about that if we returned we would have to perform an overweight landing; around 4;500 LBS overweight. We decided it was safe to continue the flight. Departure gave us a heading to rejoin the SID; which put us on a heading that we could return if need be.The Flight Attendant called us back to say the condensation was gone and had not returned. At no time while talking with Tower or Departure did we declare an emergency; only saying initially to the Tower that we needed to return to the airport. That was before we had all the information about what was happening in the cabin. Only after evaluating the facts did we decide not to return.Concentrating on planning a return overweight landing while running checklists; coordinating with ATC; and communicating with the Flight Attendant can lead to missed steps. I must continue to stay vigilant and not rush through things while also maintaining the safety of the aircraft; passengers; and crew. Also; [while] not dismissing the Flight Attendant's call; [I should] not be distracted by it during the critical phase of takeoff (especially near or at V1) until it is safe to answer. I never want to discourage anyone on the flight crew to inform me if there is a problem or safety issue.,,To prevent this type of situation from occurring again; flight crew should be aware of the difference between smoke and mist from the air conditioning packs.,,An E145 flight crew continued their takeoff when the Flight Attendant called as they approached V1. After airborne the Attendant advised of 'smoke' coming from the floor of the cabin. The smoke eventually was determined to be condensation from the air conditioning system as it cooled the hot humid air. The flight continued to its destination when the condensation was identified and later abated.,"The incident involved an E145 aircraft with an inoperative Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), requiring an external air start. During takeoff, the flight attendant reported ""smoke"" in the cabin, prompting the flight crew to consider returning to the airport. However, after further investigation, the ""smoke"" was identified as condensation from the air conditioning packs, which was exacerbated by the warm and humid cabin air from the taxi. The flight crew ultimately decided to continue the flight after the condensation dissipated and determined there was no immediate threat to safety. The proposed solution emphasizes the importance for flight crew to recognize the difference between smoke and condensation from the air conditioning system.","equipment malfunction, operational issues, crew-related issues, safety related, training, between attendant and crew"

This clearance was acknowledged by both pilots. As we approached this hold short point we were finishing up the PA and the Flight Attendant called. She indicated that we needed a wheelchair at our destination. The conversation seemed to be slightly longer than normal and so when the First Officer returned to the radio the Captain inquired if there was something wrong. During relaying this information to the Captain; the flight crew missed the hold short of L3. Air Traffic Control inquired about this and immediately issued a clearance to continue on Mike to hold short of 9L at M2. The Flight Attendant call was a distraction as well as fatigue in this instance.,,,,An air carrier Flight Attendant called the cockpit during taxi for takeoff requesting a passenger wheel chair at the destination; but the distraction plus fatigue caused a taxi deviation.,"An air carrier flight attendant called the cockpit during taxi for takeoff, requesting a wheelchair at the destination. This call, combined with crew fatigue, distracted the flight crew. As a result, the crew missed an ATC instruction to hold short of L3, leading to a minor taxi deviation. Air Traffic Control promptly corrected the situation, preventing any serious incident. The deviation was minor and corrected without incident. The event underscores the importance of effective communication protocols and crew resource management (CRM) training to mitigate distractions during critical phases of flight operations.","between attendant and crew, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, training, safety related"

We were all in our jump seats and had been anticipating landing when I noticed that we appeared to be circling. We were still at considerable altitude; higher than normal for that phase of flight. Knowing we were in 'sterile cockpit' I just waited; thinking to myself there must be a lot of traffic this time of night because if there were any problems the Captain would let us know.Just then; the 'all-call' came over the PA. I answered and identified myself. The Captain answered and said; 'We have a problem with our flaps not deploying the usual way so we have to get them down another way that just takes some time. I guess you could call this a simple 'heads up' because I anticipate a completely normal landing and there is nothing to worry about.' I said; 'Okay; thank you;' and then confirmed my crew had heard our exchange.We landed without incident; although CFR was at the ready down the runway. Upon deplaning; some passengers were curious as to why it took so long to land. I stated it was just traffic. I did not feel there was any need to alarm these passengers in any way when all was okay. There was only one passenger who challenged me by stating that he saw the fire equipment and that the flaps were still completely down even at the gate; so it wasn't just traffic.After landing and debriefing with my crew I explained what I thought had occurred and confirmed with the two flight attendants at door 4 that they both had said 'yes' when I asked if they heard the information. Unfortunately; we did not identify which doors had heard the info. I think in an effort to proctor excellent communication with all crew members when a situation that involves all crew members needing to be informed; that a new procedure [be implemented] to acknowledge receipt of the information door by door. That way if the Purser does not hear confirmation from all exits; he/she knows to relay the information to anyone who did not pick up the interphone.Upon turning on my phone on the way to the parking lot I listened to a very concerned message from a Supervisor who knew of the situation and wanted to be certain that the crew was okay. I returned her call and assured her that there was nothing out of the ordinary on landing. The Captain did not advise us to brief the cabin; it was merely a 'heads up' for the Flight Attendants and we landed without incident.,,,,Incomplete dissemination of information regarding a flap extension problem; which delayed the landing of a B757-200; left some passengers concerned; and some Flight Attendants uninformed.,"The incident involved a flap deployment issue on a B757-200 flight, which led to a delayed landing. The captain informed the flight attendants of the problem via the public address system, describing it as a minor issue that would not affect the landing. The flight attendant relayed the information to her crew and ensured they were prepared for landing. However, the delay caused some passengers to notice fire equipment on the ground, leading to questions about the situation. One passenger raised concerns about the flaps not being down, suggesting the delay was not due to traffic. After landing, the flight attendant debriefed her crew and realized that not all crew members may have received the initial communication. To address this, she proposed implementing a new procedure requiring each crew member to acknowledge receipt of information door by door, ensuring everyone is informed in similar situations. The incident concluded safely with no further issues, and the captain and crew confirmed that the landing was uneventful.","communication issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers"

The flight time was 38 minutes. The Purser was helping in the back and asked if we heard the double chimes. All four of the coach flight attendants did not hear it. I told her to go ahead and make the arrival announcement but she said that she did not feel comfortable doing so with the seatbelt sign not on.Later the Captain made the seatbelt sign announcement and illuminated the seatbelt sign. I checked seatbelts and returned to the galley and my jumpseat. We were over the water then. Later still the Purser made the arrival announcement. We made our safety checks. I was locking door three lavatories and I looked outside to see the runway. I saw jumpseat at 3R was vacant but did not want to sit in someone else's jumpseat if they could make it back to it. I landed in the aisle standing up between doors three and four. There were at least 3 other flight attendants standing on arrival as well. As soon as the airplane slowed I made it back to my jumpseat and strapped in. The Purser and the Captain were well aware of what happened. The Purser said that she wished that she listened to her gut instinct and made the arrival announcement when she heard the double chime or called the cockpit to see if they did in fact ring the double chime since the rest of us did not hear it. We would like to still have the 'flight attendant prepare for landing' announcement which we are so used to. We do need to have the arrival announcement made earlier. It would be great if the double chimes and the seat belt sign would go off together and we could do the arrival and safety checks then. We need to be more aware of this issue to not have it repeated in the future.,,,,A breakdown in communication between the flight and cabin crews as well as amongst the flight attendants themselves resulted in several flight attendants still standing and performing safety duties at touchdown.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between the flight and cabin crews during the final stages of a short-haul flight. The Purser, who was assisting in the back, initially heard double chimes signaling the need for seatbelt preparation but did not feel comfortable making the announcement without confirmation from the cockpit. Despite the Captain later illuminating the seatbelt sign and making an announcement, several flight attendants, including the Purser, were still standing and performing safety duties upon touchdown. This occurred despite the Purser expressing regret for not acting earlier and suggesting that the ""flight attendant prepare for landing"" announcement be made earlier, ideally in sync with the double chimes and seatbelt sign activation. The incident highlighted the need for clearer communication protocols and improved awareness among the cabin crew to prevent similar occurrences in the future.","communication issues, safety related, between attendant and crew"

The aircraft was in taxi out mode. The other Flight Attendant noticed that the safety strap at the L2 door was stuck in the door. I tried to pull it back in; but it would not budge. I saw some light coming through from where the strap was. I called the flightdeck; apologized for interrupting; and asked if they were showing any indications of the integrity of the seal being breeched. He said everything looked fine. I told him about the strap. I said that if he could stop the aircraft; I could quickly crack the door and bring the strap back in. He said it wasn't as easy as that because the aircraft was already pressurized. I then asked him what the ramifications could be if we left it alone. He said that it might cause a squealing sound on climb but should eventually go away when we leveled off. So; I said as long as there weren't any warning bells; and he was comfortable with leaving it; then I would leave it alone. I also said that I would contact him if anything happened. As soon as we took off; the door started squealing; and it actually got louder the higher we went. It could be heard full force all the way up to the divider. It was like a horn being blown. I waited until 10;000 to see if it would go away; but it didn't. I called the pilots; and they could hear it over the intercom without me telling them. He suggested putting a wet rag on it. That didn't do anything. No one was complaining about any physical reactions; except the other Flight Attendant was getting a headache. The noise was just so obnoxiously loud that it wasn't right to put the passengers through it. So; the Captain returned to the departure airport. On the ground; a mechanic from one of the smaller airlines; came and checked out the door seal; said it was fine; we took on more gas; and we left. Maybe emphasizing something like 'strap check' in the whole door closure routine.,,Excessively loud squeal from L2 Door caused by safety strap caught in door pressure seal. [I] elected to return to the departure airport to remove safety strap. Flight Attendant called us in the cockpit from the back of the aircraft while we were approaching the runway prior to takeoff to advise us that a safety strap was caught in an aft service/entry door. After a discussion of the situation with the crew and verification by the Flight Attendant visually and by cockpit indication that the doors were closed and locked; my assessment was that there were no associated safety of flight issues and no risk of damage to the aircraft. I discussed my assessment with the crew; considered the alternatives and the comfort level of the crew with the process; and elected to go. As is the case in situations like this; there were factors that biased my assessment that it would be OK to fly with the strap in the door frame. My bias factors were: 1. Previous experience. I had experienced safety straps in the doors of Boeing aircraft on occasion over the years; and had discussed with others their experiences. That basis of experience set my frame of reference to the situation. My mindset was that if there was no metal piece of the strap caught in the door; and nothing extending to the outside of the door; that we could operate with safety and without risk of aircraft damage. 2. Progress of flight and operational considerations. We were operating out of an airport without a Control Tower; with a limitation for one IFR or special VFR aircraft allowed to operate in the airspace at a time. We had our clearance; and had aircraft waiting behind us to receive their clearance after we exited the airspace. We discussed the possibility of having the Flight Attendant pop open the door and pull the strap in; but we were pre-pressurized for takeoff and I was not keen on the safety aspect of having the door popped open without stairs up to the aircraft. So the remaining option was to taxi down the runway and back to the ramp; shut down; bring the stairs; and open the door to clear the strap. That option also would have made it necessary to refuel to bring us back to our required fuel after the taxi burn; which at this particular airport equates to a significant wait time for the fueler to show up. Did I make the right choice? No. That was apparent to me immediately during climbout when the flight attendants called on the Service Interphone and I could hear the squeal in the background. I had heard pressure squeals in the past but nothing close to the loudness of this one. Would I make that choice again? No. What I will do and what I would share with other crews is that it is necessary to clear the strap from the door frame prior to flight. Doesn't matter if it requires a taxi-back; another de-ice; more fuel; ATC clearance issues; or any other operationally undesirable factors which exist.,,A B737's L2 door safety strap was trapped in the door seal after it was closed but the crew decided to depart only to return to the departure airport because of the excessively loud squeal.,"The incident involved a safety strap on the B737's L2 door becoming trapped during closure. The flight attendant noticed the issue and informed the cockpit, but the pilots assessed it as low risk, deciding to proceed with takeoff. During the flight, a loud squealing noise developed, prompting an immediate return to the departure airport. Mechanics confirmed the door's integrity, and the flight resumed after refueling. The flight attendant suggested incorporating a more thorough strap check into pre-flight procedures. The pilot acknowledged bias from past experiences and operational constraints, learning the importance of resolving such issues before takeoff to prevent disruptions.","equipment malfunction, between attendant and crew, operational issues, emergency, training, crew-related issues"

I advised Commercial radio and a discrete HF frequency was arranged and the patch was made. An on board ER nurse attended the passenger; made evaluations; provided treatment; and talked directly to Medlink. Medlink advised that we could continue and to provide O2 as needed. The Flight Attendant advised that they were using the Therapeutic O2 bottle. The Flight Attendant later advised us when the therapeutic bottle reached 250 PSI and a decompression bottle was used. As we still had several hours of flying; we discussed O2 use; and operational restrictions regarding depletion of O2 bottles. The First Officer and I discussed that the safest course of action; regardless of O2 quantities; would be to remain at altitude. I advised the First Officer that I was exercising Captains Emergency Authority in the event any of those bottles went below the prescribed volumes in order to remain at altitude. I discussed an O2 use plan with the Flight Attendant. We discussed using one decompression bottle to 1;500 PSI; then switch to the other decompression bottle; and use it until depleted. Shortly afterwards; she advised me that the first decompression bottle was at 1;250 PSI. I told her to switch to decompression bottle two; use it to 1;500 PSI; then use decompression bottle one; and deplete it. My thought was to ensure the Flight Attendant's maintained full capabilities in their mobility bottles. Shortly after this discussion; the  Flight Attendant advised that they could use their mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. With this information we revised our plan to include the mobility bottles as long as they ensured the mobility bottles did not go below 1;000 PSI. ACARS messages were sent to Dispatch advising them of the O2 usage and the volume levels of the bottles. After the second decompression bottle was used to 1;500 PSI; two mobility bottles were depleted to 1;000 PSI and a third was being used as we began our descent. Upon landing we were met by medics and the passenger was transported to medical facilities. Once we were deplaned I discussed O2 bottle usage with the Flight Attendants to ensure I fully understood the amount used. I discovered that the therapeutic bottle was depleted to 250 PSI; the number one decompression bottle to 250 PSI; number two to 1;500 PSI; and two mobility bottles to 1;000 PSI. Mechanics boarded the aircraft; were advised and we discussed the write ups of the bottles as well as the EMK. [We were in a] high workload environment in ETOPS airspace. Medlink event happened near a waypoint with need to arrange for Medlink; plot; and report waypoints; monitor Medlink transmissions via HF; and derive an O2 use plan with Flight Attendant's that would be sufficient for a number of hours. There appeared to be confusion between the naming conventions of each type of bottle and the amount we could use before encountering altitude restrictions. I thought that the Flight Attendant was trading the names of the therapeutic bottle and the decompression bottle. Once on the ground I discovered that both the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle were depleted to 250 PSI.,,,,An  Air Carrier flight crew depleted their cabin oxygen bottles below acceptable limits while treating a passenger who became ill near the ETP. There was confusion with naming conventions of the bottles and operational restrictions.,"The incident involved a flight crew and a flight attendant responding to a passenger illness requiring medical attention during a flight in ETOPS airspace. The flight attendant initially requested Medlink assistance, and the crew arranged for a discrete HF frequency to facilitate communication. An onboard emergency room nurse evaluated the passenger, and Medlink advised continuing the flight while providing oxygen as needed. The flight attendant used a therapeutic oxygen bottle, later switching to decompression bottles and mobility bottles as the flight progressed. Despite efforts to manage oxygen levels, confusion arose regarding the naming conventions and operational restrictions of the oxygen bottles. As a result, some bottles were depleted below prescribed limits. Upon landing, the crew reviewed the oxygen usage and discovered discrepancies in the bottle levels, including the therapeutic bottle and one mobility bottle being depleted to 250 PSI. Mechanics were boarded to address the oxygen bottle write-ups and ensure compliance with safety standards. Post-incident, the crew discussed the oxygen bottle usage to clarify naming conventions and prevent future operational issues.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, health and medical issues, communication issues, training, between attendant and crew"

We were 20 minutes early and had to wait for a gate. I informed my Captain during deplanning.,,,,B737 Flight Attendant was up and walking to her jump seat when the aircraft landed.,"The incident involved a B737 flight attendant who was observed moving about the aircraft during landing. She was walking to her jump seat when the aircraft landed, a procedure that may have contravened safety protocols. The flight crew, on their way to the jumpseat, noticed her movement and informed the Captain during deplaning. The outcome was that the flight attendant was reprimanded for her actions, highlighting the need for adherence to safety procedures. No further action was noted beyond the crew's report.","safety related, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

It was raining fairly hard as well; and water was blowing in the forward galley door. I was saying goodbye to the passengers. Toward the end of deplaning; a woman who looked to be in her twenties; turned right to exit the aircraft instead of following those people directly in front of her who had turned left and exited properly. I immediately caught her turning and began to say repeatedly; 'NO; NO; NO; NO!!! Ma'am please turn around and go the other way'. The passenger continued on and stepped out onto the provisioning truck; finally stopping; turning around; getting back on the aircraft; and exiting aircraft left. The passenger never said anything to me or any (company) personnel. I should have been in the galley. It is very difficult when at times there are 3 crew members; provisioning and agents all jockeying for the same galley space. Perhaps there is some sort of temporary boundary that could be placed between the galley area and aisle to help passengers avoid mistakes. Although; I'm sure this would be considered a safety hazard.,,,,While deplaning; a passenger turned right into a B737 galley and; with the Flight Attendant calling to her; out into a provisioning truck before realizing the error; turning around and exiting the main cabin door.,"The incident occurred during the deplaning process of a flight. A passenger in her twenties attempted to exit the aircraft by turning right near the forward bulkhead, deviating from the standard leftward exit path used by other passengers. The flight attendant noticed this and repeatedly instructed the passenger to turn around and exit the correct way. Despite the attendant's intervention, the passenger continued to the provisioning truck, realized her mistake, reboarded the aircraft, and exited through the proper left-side door. The passenger did not engage in communication with the flight attendant or any crew members. The flight attendant reflected on the challenges faced during deplaning, particularly the limited space and the presence of multiple individuals (crew, provisioners, and agents) in the galley area. She suggested the possibility of implementing a temporary boundary to prevent such incidents, though she acknowledged the potential safety concerns associated with this idea.","disruptive, between attendant and passengers"

I immediately called the flight crew to inform them that all the power in the galley went out and the overhead lights flickered in the entire cabin. They informed me that they had a problem with a generator and were about to diagnose the problem. The same problem repeated a few more times as we lost galley power and lights in the cabin. Later the cockpit informed the Purser that it was safe to continue the trip. I was concerned that we were over land and that I did not feel comfortable flying across the Atlantic with one broken generator. Another Flight Attendant called the cockpit to ask them how safe it was to continue. The cockpit was evasive and never said whether it was safe or not. It led us to think that continuing to fly over the Atlantic and gambling with our lives on this issue was not being cautious enough; especially since we were still over land at the time of the generator problem.Later; another Flight Attendant informed me that the pilots told him that we have seven of these generators and that only one failed. Nevertheless; it did not put me at ease to think that we were going to fly over the ocean even after raising concerns about the dangerous goods on board. Was the airplane safe enough to continue its voyage? It is not for me to say as I have no control over the issue but it sure raised concern as to problems that can be resolved over land and not while over the ocean. Failed generators should not be taken lightly when planning to fly over the Atlantic.,,,,After one generator failed shortly after takeoff; the flight attendants aboard a B777-200 headed for an Atlantic crossing failed to have their concerns about the safety of continuing the flight properly addressed by the flight crew.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew and a flight attendant regarding the safety of continuing a transatlantic flight after a generator failure. Shortly after takeoff, the flight attendant reported multiple instances of generator power loss, including flickering cabin lights and a loss of galley power. The flight crew diagnosed the issue but provided unclear reassurances about the safety of continuing the flight, particularly since the problem occurred while still over land. The flight attendant expressed concerns about the risks of crossing the Atlantic with a failed generator and questioned whether the aircraft was sufficiently safe. Despite the pilots' assurance that only one of seven generators had failed, the flight attendant remained uneasy, highlighting the risks of unresolved issues over water. The incident raised concerns about the adequacy of communication and safety assessments during critical flight phases. No specific solution was proposed in the context, but the need for clearer communication and reassessment of safety concerns was implied.","equipment malfunction, safety related, between attendant and crew, communication issues"

I proceeded to get up and disarm the slide and remove the red strap across the window. I then turned on the POS to transmit and unlocked the lavatories. I left the galley and stood by the aft lavatories and watched the deplaning process. A few passengers came back to use the restroom. Deplaning was a slow process.When there were only a few passengers left another Flight Attendant suggested we check to make sure the slides were disarmed. I was not expecting anything to be wrong. She then turned and said that my slide was still armed but my red strap was undone. I was in total disbelief! I could not believe that when I bent down to disarm the slide that I did not. I have never removed the red strap prior to disarming the door. I have always been extremely careful in following procedures. I cannot explain why the slide was not disarmed. I can see myself bending down and disarming the door. There were no emergencies or passengers asking for things or anything to disrupt my routine. However; when I proceeded back to disarm the door the second time; I did notice that the hooks that the slide sits in when disarmed were loose. The bar was more or less just sitting in the hooks rather than needing to be pressed down. So now I wonder if I put the bar in the hooks but did not make certain they were in there securely and they slipped out. My error is that I did not double and triple check the disarmed door to make sure the bar stayed in the hooks and would not fall out. Another factor may have been that I was tired and ready to get off the airplane. What I learned in this situation was to just step back and review all of the procedures each and every time I am disarming/arming a door. Maybe it has become such a habit that I need to make sure I am absolutely aware of what I am doing at all times.,,,,A B737-900 Flight Attendant failed to properly disarm her emergency exit. An alert compatriot noted the error and the omission was promptly corrected.,"The incident occurred during the deplaning process of a B737-900 aircraft when the lead flight attendant failed to properly disarm her emergency exit slide. After completing routine procedures, including disarming the slide and removing the red strap, the lead attendant monitored the deplaning process. However, an alert colleague noticed the slide was still armed, prompting the lead attendant to re-examine her actions. Upon revisiting, she discovered the slide's hooks were loose, causing the bar to slip out. Reflecting on the oversight, the lead attendant attributed the error to not thoroughly securing the bar and possible fatigue. She learned the importance of meticulously reviewing procedures each time, especially ensuring the bar was securely placed. The colleague's timely intervention corrected the error, emphasizing the value of diligence and teamwork in safety protocols.","equipment malfunction, safety related, crew-related issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

She said a passenger found it in the seatback pocket. I had a napkin; held out my hand; turned to the cockpit door which was still open; and told the Captain. It was his decision to reopen the door and hand it off to security. Flight Attendant #3 and I both went to her door to disarm and wait for agents. When the door opened; I stepped to the threshold and handed the item to the security agent and explained the situation. (I was unable to step off the aircraft because of minimum crew issues). He immediately started turning the item over and opening it up. Both of us flight attendants were astonished at this and said as much. A gate agent didn't seem the least bit concerned so I said; I don't believe a proper security check was done on the aircraft for one; and secondly it is not procedure to open/handle any items found on the aircraft that they are to be treated as a potential (non secure) item. The gate agent said that he didn't see what the problem was; it was a Palm Pilot and he made a 'risk assessment' of the item and 'it doesn't look like a bomb'! Again; the #3 and I were horrified that he would even say something to that nature; especially since the passengers seated in rows 9 and 10 were in clear earshot of his comment. The #3 and I both told him to keep it down and what was he thinking saying something like that? I turned and went to the cockpit to relay the information the Captain. Shortly thereafter; the gate agent came into the cockpit with the item; at which time I left. The Captain had a discussion with him; during which time the #3 had been in verbal contact with one of our FAMs seated in row 4 to let them know what was going on. Later on in flight we had a chance to discuss the situation with the team leader of the FAMs that evening. We expressed our concern to both the Captain and the FAM leader about the lack of concern shown and how we felt the situation was handled in a complete opposite way that we as flight attendants have always been trained. The gate agent showed no concern toward the situation and treated #3 and I as if we were complete idiots and overreacting to something that was in his opinion just a Palm Pilot that was clearly left on board by a passenger.,,,,A B757 Flight Attendant was given a Palm Pilot type device which a passenger found in a seatback before departure. The item was given to a gate agent who did not handle the item as a security risk which bothered the flight attendants.,"The incident began when a flight attendant discovered a silver item resembling a Palm Pilot in a seatback pocket. It was handed to another attendant, who proceeded to the cockpit. The captain decided to reopen the door to transfer the item to security. Upon opening the door, the flight attendant handed the item to the security agent, who immediately examined and opened it, surprising the attendants. A gate agent, unimpressed, dismissed the item as a simple Palm Pilot and made a risk assessment, claiming it didn't look like a bomb. This comment distressed the attendants, as nearby passengers could hear the exchange. They expressed their concerns to the gate agent, urging caution and adherence to security protocols. The attendant informed the captain, who spoke with the gate agent. Meanwhile, another attendant kept the FAMs informed. Later, the flight attendants discussed their concerns with the FAM team leader, highlighting the gate agent's lack of concern and the mishandling of the situation, which conflicted with their training. They felt the agent's dismissal was inappropriate and questioned his judgment.","safety related, between attendant and other people, crew-related issues"

This was a completely full flight; with 2 jumpseat riders in the cabin and 1 in the cockpit.  Shortly after takeoff; the aircraft leveled off.  I noticed that it seemed too early to level off and thought we would continue the climb out momentarily.  Instead; the aircraft started to turn.  I was still in my jumpseat; as we were under 10;000 FT. Neither I nor the jumpseat rider next to me ever heard; felt; or smelled anything different with the aircraft.  After a few minutes; the Captain made a PA to the passengers that we blew a tire on takeoff and we would have to circle to burn off fuel so we could return and land.  After his PA to the passengers; the Captain called back to the Flight Attendants to tell us we blew a tire; we had 30 minutes before landing; do not go through the emergency procedure checklist; and he did not anticipate evacuating but if we did the signal would be our standard.  While the aircraft was circling; we flight attendants did frequent walk throughs to make sure everyone had all bags stowed; electronic devices off; seatbelts fastened; and tray tables and seatbacks up.  Otherwise; we stayed strapped into our jumpseats.  30 minutes came and went with no other communication from the cockpit at all.  I call the cockpit to ask when we were going to land.  I was told it would be about 15 more minutes.  When I sit on the #1 Flight Attendant jumpseat; I cannot see out the windows.  I started to get worried because the Captain was so uncommunicative; I was afraid we would touch down and crash without even knowing we were about to land!  I called the Captain and told him to let us know when we were about to touch down so we could be prepared.  Right before we touched down; he called us and told us we were about to land and it was going to be rough.  I am not sure the exact verbiage; but the #4 Flight Attendant asked if we had one or two tires on the nosegear and the Captain made a flippant; curt reply to this valid question.  The landing was smooth and we taxied to the gate.  When I opened the aircraft door; a woman from Flight Service and a mechanic were waiting for us.  I was the only crew member Flight Service spoke with.  She asked if we were OK.  During this time; two fire fighters with silver suits came up the jetbridge stairs; stood on the jetbridge for a few moments and left.  I kept asking if we blew a tire; as nobody explained to the flight attendants what had actually happened.  The Captain did not let us know on landing if the aircraft was OK or broken.  After many repeated questions upon arrival at the gate; I was told that nobody knew what was wrong with the plane because we had all our tires.  The cabin crew and passengers were informed that we would be changing aircraft and to go to the new gate.  This emergency was handled by the cockpit very poorly.  Company procedures were not followed.  The passengers were informed of the problem before the flight attendants were told; which is NOT procedure.  I had to initiate contact with the Captain.  He did not keep the flight attendants updated on the situation.  We had plenty of time to have gone through the emergency checklist; since we had to circle for so long.  If the Captain suspected it was going to be a rough landing; why did he say NOT to do the emergency checklist?  If the landing was going to be rough; I believe it is procedure for the Captain to say 'Brace'.  We never heard the 'Brace' command.  I was sitting on my jumpseat; waiting to land on the nose and go skidding across the runway with flames shooting out where the nosegear is supposed to be.  The flight attendants were not kept adequately and timely informed of the situation.,,,,MD80 flight attendant was notified by the cockpit crew they were going to return after blowing a nose tire.  The Flight Attendant feels this situation was not handled appropriately by the cockpit crew; creating a confused situation for the uninformed cabin crew.,"The incident involved a flight crew and cabin crew on an MD80 aircraft following a reported tire blowout shortly after takeoff. The flight attendant reported that the Captain informed passengers and the cabin crew about the incident but failed to maintain proper communication with the flight attendants throughout the event. The flight attendant expressed concerns about the lack of updates from the cockpit, which left the cabin crew and passengers in a state of uncertainty. The situation was further complicated by the Captain's refusal to follow standard emergency procedures, such as issuing a ""Brace"" command or allowing the cabin crew to execute the emergency checklist, despite having sufficient time to do so. The flight attendant also noted that the Captain did not provide adequate information upon landing, leaving the cabin crew uninformed about the aircraft's condition. The incident resulted in confusion and frustration among the cabin crew, who felt the cockpit crew mishandled the situation and did not adhere to company protocols. A proposed solution would involve improving communication between the cockpit and cabin crew during emergencies and ensuring adherence to established procedures to better manage such incidents.","communication issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

Corrective action had been taken; including replacing a temperature controller. We also could not control the pack valves with the temperature controllers in auto or manual. At cruise altitude; the left pack ran full hot and resulted in a duct overheat. The overheat produced a strong hot ducting smell in the cabin before it tripped and cooled off. The passengers and Flight Attendants were briefly alarmed and both pilots donned O2 masks and accomplished the Smoke/Fumes Checklists until we were sure the incident was from the duct overheat. Good air quality was regained and we continued to our destination. Here is the error that led to the overheat and smell: We discovered in the next few minutes of flight that the temperature controllers were cross wired. The left [temp selector] controlled the right pack valve and the right controlled the left pack valve. We caused the duct overheat by moving the right [temp selector] to manual hot to unstick a full cold right valve; but this caused the left valve to run full hot. Attempts to cool the left side with the left [temp selector] only kept the right full cold. When Maintenance replaced the temperature controller they failed to verify it was hooked up properly. A simple check with the APU running would have allowed them to confirm left to left and right to right.[There was] uncontrollable air conditioning due to Maintenance error. When replacing systems that are identical and parallel; Maintenance needs to ensure they are not cross wired. A Functional Test of the system controller should be required before the item is signed off.,Reporter stated he had a lengthy discussion with one of their mechanics after the flight arrival in order to give Maintenance a clear picture of the temperature control problems were. The Packs did respond to their Temperature Selector positions; once he and the First Officer figured out what was going on with the Left and Right Selectors. The gate Mechanic went up and checked the Canon plug connectors for the Temperature Selectors and found them cross-connected.,,,A Captain reports about uncontrollable air conditioning high temperatures at cruise altitude on a B737-500 caused by Maintenance error. Crew could not control pack temperatures with temperature selectors in auto or manual. Temperature controller had been replaced earlier; a Functional Check was not performed. New controller was found to be cross-wired.,"The incident involved a B737-500 aircraft experiencing uncontrollable high temperatures in the cabin during cruise altitude. The issue arose due to a maintenance error when replacing the temperature controller. The replacement was not properly tested, resulting in the temperature controllers being cross-wired. This caused the left pack to run at full heat, leading to a duct overheat and a strong smell in the cabin. The crew donned oxygen masks and followed smoke/fumes checklists to resolve the situation, after which normal air quality was restored, and the flight continued to its destination. The proposed solution is to conduct a functional test of the system controller before signing off on such maintenance tasks to prevent similar incidents.","safety related, equipment malfunction, fume/smoke incident, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

MEL states that seat must be secured retracted with 'tape of a contrasting color' and that the nearest passenger seat must be reserved for the Flight Attendant; and placarded 'For Flight Attendant Use Only'. Commuter flight was 4 hours late; and I was 1.5 hours late for sign in. Aircraft was loaded and the crew and passengers were ready to go when I boarded. [I] gave a brief to the Purser; who was someone familiar to me; and asked if they had taken note of the placarded seat. She said they had; so we departed after completing all checklists. Logbook was properly filled out and placarded for the jumpseat; but I did not physically check the seat. Two hours into the flight we got a call that the 4R jumpseat would not retract. I asked if it had been secured retracted and was told it was not. Entered in logbook that seat was not secured in accordance with MEL. Later; [I] received another call that there was some misunderstanding. There had been an issue with a passenger seat during boarding; and the Purser thought this was what I had referenced in my brief. Since I wasn't there during boarding; I was unaware of this issue and it wasn't in the logbook; and none of the Flight Attendants were aware of the placarded Flight Attendant jumpseat. Apparently; the jumpseat had been secured with tape of the same color as the seat; and the tape had come loose so the seat was available for use; but it still did not retract properly. The appropriate passenger seat had been placarded for Flight Attendant use; but the Flight Attendant MANAGER; prior to boarding; had apparently assumed it was an unauthorized action by the Flight Attendants to obtain a crew rest seat; and removed the tape and placard. Hence; we departed using a placarded and malfunctioning Flight Attendant jumpseat. Once all this became known; the Flight Attendants secured the jumpseat as best they could and used the appropriate passenger seat for landing.,,,,Air Carrier Captain reports confusion among the cabin crew over a malfunctioning jumpseat that has been MEL'ed but not properly identified to the crew.,"The incident involved a conflict between a Flight Attendant and the Flight Crew regarding a malfunctioning jumpseat on a commuter flight. The Flight Attendant identified a Maintenance Evaluation Log (MEL) issue with the 4R aft door Flight Attendant jumpseat, which was not retracting properly. According to the MEL, the seat needed to be secured, placarded, and the nearest passenger seat reserved for the Flight Attendant. Despite these requirements, the jumpseat was secured with tape of the same color as the seat, making it less visible, and the placard was removed by the Flight Attendant Manager, who believed it was unauthorized. This led to confusion among the cabin crew, as they were unaware of the issue and the proper procedures. Two hours into the flight, the jumpseat malfunctioned, prompting the crew to secure it and use an appropriate passenger seat for landing. The incident highlights the importance of proper communication and adherence to MEL procedures to ensure passenger and crew safety.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, between attendant and crew"

All takeoff bug speeds were verified in accordance with normal procedures. I was Captain and pilot flying. During takeoff roll; V1 auto-callout was announced by the aircraft 20 knots early. I eased back on the yoke and began rotation; when I realized I was below rotation speed. There was no pilot monitoring callout for rotation. I eased the nose of the aircraft back to the runway. I then rotated at the normal rotation speed and achieved approximately 10 degrees nose up at about 155-160 KTS. Everything else seemed normal. At 10;000 FT; after the sterile chime; a Flight Attendant asked me about the attempted rotation and set down. Her verbiage was approximately; 'What was that bump?' I explained what had happened and inquired if she heard any scraping. She said no. We pressurized normally and continued to our destination. At 3 hours into the flight (approximately); the flight attendants expressed concern that we had scraped the aircraft on takeoff; but were not sure. Upon receiving this new information; the copilot and I conducted the suspected tail-strike on takeoff portion of the QRH. We landed without declaring an emergency at our scheduled destination. After landing; and upon a post flight inspection; damage to the tail-skid was discovered. Dispatch and Chief Pilot were contacted.,,During preflight; I followed all normal procedures. The takeoff data V speeds did not automatically upload to the FMC. I manually inputted the correct V speed from the paperwork into the FMC. I verified they matched prior to pushback. There was no runway change from what I expected prior to pushback to what we received for our takeoff runway. During our takeoff roll; V1 was called early by the auto-voice. I think it was early by about 20 KTS. The Captain started a slow rotation. I knew it was too early; but was unsure of what procedure to advise him to stop rotation. I didn't want to say STOP or ROTATE for fear of confusion. He also recognized the problem shortly after I did and lowered the nose to the ground. Our takeoff then proceeded normally. After 10;000 FT; the Captain spoke with the Flight Attendant and she did not think there was a tail scraping during our takeoff. After about 3 hours more; the Flight Attendants decided we might have scraped some metal on takeoff. We did the QRH procedure for tail strike on takeoff and landed at our destination uneventfully. Because we suspected damage; we conducted a thorough exterior inspection and found some damage on the tail skid plate.,,A B737-800 Captain rotated 20 KTS below V1 when the autovoice V1 erroneously made the callout and then set down for a short period before rotating again. During the second rotation a tail strike occurred which flight attendants reported but the pilots did not immediately react to the report.,"The incident was triggered by an early V1 call from the auto-voice system during takeoff, prompting the Captain to rotate the aircraft prematurely. During takeoff, the Captain began rotating 20 knots below the required V1 speed due to the early call. Recognizing the issue, the Captain set the aircraft back down, then rotated again at the correct speed. Post-takeoff, a Flight Attendant inquired about a perceived bump, but the pilots initially ruled out any scraping. Three hours into the flight, the Flight Attendants expressed concern about potential damage, leading the pilots to consult the QRH for a tail strike. The aircraft landed safely, and a post-flight inspection revealed tail-skid damage. The aircraft sustained tail-skid damage but landed without emergency declaration. The incident highlighted the need for procedures to address early V1 calls and enhance crew communication during takeoffs. The investigation likely led to updated protocols for handling early V1 callouts and improving crew coordination to prevent similar incidents.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

I had asked the Captain if any warnings; cautions; or smoke alarms were activated on the EICAS or the lower lobe crew rest facility. He stated that there were no indications of any sort. Additionally there was no evidence of smoke permeating into the cabin and none of the passengers in the area of the rest facility reported smoke to the flight attendants who were on duty.,,The reading light in a B777's lower level crew rest area emitted a puff of smoke which a Flight Attendant then shot with halon. No fire or smoke sensors were activated.,"In a recent incident involving a B777 aircraft, a flight attendant detected a puff of smoke emanating from a reading light in the lower lobe crew rest area. Upon noticing this, the attendant discharged a halon fire extinguisher on the light fixture and promptly informed the cockpit. The captain acknowledged the situation and requested the attendant to turn off the light, though she was unable to do so. There were no alarms triggered in either the crew rest area or the cockpit, and subsequent investigation by the purser confirmed that the issue had been resolved. As a precaution, all flight attendants evacuated the lower lobe crew rest area. The captain then contacted maintenance, who recommended removing the faulty bulb. This was executed without complications. Maintenance logged a report regarding the incident, including the halon discharge. Both maintenance and dispatch concurred with the captain's decision to proceed to the planned destination. Throughout the remainder of the flight, flight attendants monitored the area, reporting no further issues. Upon arrival, contract mechanics inspected the area but found no abnormalities, attributing the small smoke emission to a likely faulty bulb.","fume/smoke incident, equipment malfunction, between attendant and crew"

It is very faint in flight.  I turned around and was prepared to keep the cockpit secure.  I saw that it was our First Flight Attendant.  He said that they had been trying to call us but the bells in the cockpit were not working.  We looked around and found that the handset at the back of the center console was slightly out of its cradle.  I was not aware that that silences all the call chimes in the cockpit.  We then had the flight attendants call us with the cockpit handset secured and off the hook and determined that it indeed does cut out the cockpit chimes when off the hook.  We flew on and landed as planned.  The flight was normal.  The man on the phone that asked for the report said there was some issue with my headset.  I don't know what that is about.  I was wearing the same headset that I have used for the last seven years; including all the check rides and flights with chief pilots and check airmen.  I have a noise canceling aviation headset.  It works great.  It protects my hearing and makes the HF radio clear and understandable.  It was plugged into the headset plugs in the airplane and I was monitoring 123.45 and 121.5.,The reporter states that the continuous chime announcing that the door unlock code had been entered was audible but not something that he had heard before and was therefore somewhat surprised when the cockpit door opened.,While in cruise; approximately 3 hours into flight; A Flight Attendant tried to check on our welfare; but we did not hear the inter phone chimes because the inter phone was not in its cradle properly or reset. Since there was no response from us; the Flight Attendant used the flight deck door code to enter the flight deck. I did not hear the door alarm. The cause of not hearing the flight deck inter phone chime was the improper cradling or reset of the hand set. Both myself and the First Officer were wearing head sets with both ears covered and I was listening to the HF radio and the common frequency for reports of turbulence; which I believe prevented us from hearing the door alarm.,,B757-200 flight crew is surprised to see the a Flight Attendant entering the cockpit to check on their welfare during a night flight over the Pacific.  The call bells were muted due to the handset not being in its' cradle and both pilots were wearing noise canceling headsets masking the door chimes.,"During a B757-200 flight over the Pacific, the flight crew was cruising at night when an incident occurred. The cause was identified as the cockpit handset being out of its cradle, which muted the call chimes. Additionally, the pilots were wearing noise-cancelling headsets, which prevented them from hearing the door alarm. The flight attendant attempted to contact the cockpit via interphone but received no response. As a result, the attendant used the door code to enter the cockpit. The pilots did not hear the door alarm, partly due to the headsets and their focus on monitoring the HF radio and common frequency. The incident was resolved when the crew secured the cockpit handset, restoring normal operations. The flight landed as planned without further issues. The proposed solution was to ensure the handset is properly secured to prevent similar occurrences.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

The Captain and I were both taken off guard by this because we were in sterile cockpit. However; we felt that there may be a safety of flight issue or physical threat to the Flight Attendant. The Captain looked at me to answer to the call. When I answered the Flight Attendant sounded nervous and distressed and said that a passenger was 'being disruptive; arguing with her and is on his phone. He won't turn off his phone even though I made three announcements. Do I have time to go back again and tell him to turn it off?' I said; 'No; we are in the approach phase. Stay seated and we can make an announcement.' After the initial call we were cleared for the approach and had intercepted the localizer. The glide slope started coming down. The Captain called for 'flaps 15' and I put the flaps into position. I informed the Captain of the issue and she said to make a 'loud' announcement that all electronic devices must be turned off. I made an assertive PA. After the PA; the glide slope was still coming down to be intercepted and the Captain called 'gear down'. I put the gear down and did the pilot not flying 'flow'. The Captain called 'Flaps 20 Before Landing Checklist' and I did the respective pilot not flying duties. I asked if we needed to make sure the Flight Attendant was seated and the problem was handled because we were unsure where the passenger was and if he was a physical threat. The Captain said 'yeah; call quickly to make sure' and I used the call button to call the cabin. The Flight Attendant answered and said that the passenger was 'not listening' but did not indicate that anything else was wrong and said he was in his seat. At that time; we stopped all communication with the cabin because we did not feel that there was an immediate threat to the approach or landing the aircraft. We continued the ILS 4R approach and landed without incident. Upon landing and clearing the runway we were instructed to contact Ground. Ground gave us taxi instructions to taxi via 22R; E; to the gate. Then; per standard BOS procedure; I took Comm 2 to contact Operations and get a gate assignment and the Captain monitored Comm 1. The Captain said we should have security meet us to handle the passenger. I agreed and asked Operations to have police meet the aircraft. We completed the after landing checklist; taxied to the gate; and completed the parking checklist. Upon reaching the gate; passengers were deplaned as usual (pending a 5 minute delay while we waited for security); the Captain contacted Operations; and I spoke with the police about the matter. ATC was NOT made aware of what happened because; after our final call to the cabin; we did not feel that there was a threat to the safe operation of the aircraft. Upon completing the flight we discussed what should have been done and what actions could have been better. We agreed that we should not have answered the call because the EMER switch (indicative of an emergency) was not used. Therefore; we should have continued the flight and assessed the situation further once we had landed. In the future; I will not answer calls initiated by the cabin during sterile cockpit unless the EMER switch is used to indicate an emergency condition. Answering the call only increases workload during a time of task saturation. I will also ensure that all crew members understand communication requirements and what is expected during sterile cockpit and emergency operations.,,,,An air carrier First Officer discussed the propriety of a call from a Flight Attendant regarding a disruptive passenger during approach and landing.,"The incident occurred during an ILS 4R approach into BOS when a Flight Attendant contacted the cockpit about a disruptive passenger. The call was unexpected as the crew was in the sterile cockpit phase. The passenger was refusing to turn off his phone, prompting the Flight Attendant to seek assistance. The crew decided to address the issue by making a PA announcement, continuing the approach, and landing safely. Post-landing, they requested security to handle the passenger. The crew later reflected that answering the call during sterile cockpit may have been unnecessary, leading to a decision to improve communication protocols to avoid similar distractions in the future.","disruptive, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

We were level at 11;000 FT heading about 210 when both First Officer and I heard our callsign and instructions to descend to 6;000 FT and head 190. We were instructed to contact Approach on 119.4 and told of traffic at 1 o'clock and 10;000 FT. I stated to the First Officer 'I wonder why they would give us that clearance with traffic over there.' I had barely started down when the First Officer told me to level as she was looking at the TCAS and I was searching outside. I actually climbed the aircraft before getting the RA. People were deviating from LIT all the way in and also in the terminal area. The ATC Manager said those instructions were for another flight and that the Controller had issued them twice. We evidentially responded on the second call but we were blocked by the other flight responding. This was the second 84 plus hour month in a row for me having just completed a 4 day trip and flying 25.30 hours on that trip. I was assigned this trip in the evening and confirmed the deadhead out with crew scheduling. I had to sit in the jumpseat out because the dead head was made on an oversold flight and could not check in early for a seat. The agent said it was either the jumpseat or not at all. Crew tracking could not be reached (did not answer my call to resolve issue) I took the jumpseat and headed out. It was either that or not get there in time for the flight I was working out. Fatigue does cause one to lose that edge especially needed in the terminal area. I even question myself now as to why I would have even begun such a descent. If my game was on it would not have happened. With 4 days of early get ups it is not surprising that this could have happened. With manning the way it is I expect more of these types of deviations to affect the pilots at our company. Just look at how much flying reserve pilots did at my base and you'll get my point. I guess some would say that was perfect utilization of the reserves. Pilots on reserve know better. We are pretty much beat.,,We were deviating around build ups at 11;000 and unable to cross STONZ on BYP arrival. We had been coordinating with ATC. I (pilot not flying) stated that we were unable to cross STONZ. What I heard after that was fly heading 190 descend to 6;000 contact Approach which seemed very reasonable considering we were deviating and need to rejoin the arrival. I read that back and then the Controller said that we had traffic 1 o'clock at 10;000. I responded that we were looking and switched frequencies. I think I called twice. During this time I was looking at the TCAS screen and the pilot flying had started down. I saw the conflict and told him to level. He clicked off the autopilot and was beginning a climb when we got the RA. I checked in again and stated we were responding to an RA. After the Captain spoke with ATC Manager and we learned the clearance had not been ours. We had no idea the conflict was our fault until the tape was pulled. I have no idea how we mistook a 4 digit call sign for a 3 digit call sign.  I will be extremely cautious in the future. I just wanted to add that once we leveled and began to climb I did have the aircraft in sight. This was not an abrupt maneuver by any means.,,Air Carrier flight crew reports accepting a clearance to descend intended for another aircraft which results in a TCAS RA. Fatigue was cited as a factor.,"The incident occurred when a flight crew mistakenly accepted a descent clearance intended for another aircraft, resulting in a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA). The pilot, experiencing fatigue due to long working hours and a deadhead flight, descended after receiving the instruction. The First Officer noticed a conflict on the TCAS and instructed the pilot to level, but the pilot initially climbed, prompting the RA. The crew later learned the clearance was for another flight, issued twice by ATC. Fatigue was identified as a contributing factor, with the pilot noting the impact of extended hours on performance. The incident highlights the need for improved crew scheduling and management to mitigate fatigue-related risks.","crew-related issues, operational issues, safety related, between attendant and crew"

After I determined what the problem was I went to the jet bridge to call Maintenance Control. At the same time there was a Flight Attendant using the other phone on the jet bridge. As I was talking the Flight Attendant paused her conversation to ask me if it was OK to board the aircraft. I replied; 'No; it is not OK to board; please hold boarding'. She then advised the gate agent 'the mechanic said no; it is not OK to board'.After I finished my conversation with Maintenance Control; I went back to the cockpit to inform the Captain. I also informed the flight crew and the flight attendants that I had to go down in the E&E compartment to do a 'BITE' test on the IRU; and for them to not let any one near this area. At that point I proceed to go to the E&E compartment through the floor entrance.Shortly after I entered the E&E compartment I heard a noise. I looked to my right and discovered that someone had fallen into the E&E compartment. I asked the passenger if he was OK and he confirmed that he was. At that point I called out for help. After what seemed to be a minute or two the passenger stood up. I asked him again if he was OK and he said 'yes; I am OK'. At that point I watched him as he climbed out of the E&E compartment.,,The Captain attempted to help the individual who became belligerent and non-compliant to instructions from both him and the Purser.,,A Mechanic who needed to access the E&E compartment of a B767-300ER asked that boarding be delayed until he finished his maintenance procedure.

I could see the Ramp Agent pushing the stairs to the aft door; so I made the announcement that we would be deplaning out both the forward and aft exits. Although the door chime had not been given; the Ramp Agent opened the aft door and gave me a thumbs up to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots never told us to hold passengers and I could see that the 'A' Flight Attendant had opened the main cabin door; so I let passengers start to deplane. I did not realize an engine was still running due to problems with the APU. I was having trouble getting my ears to pop and could not hear very well. The ramp agents never told me to keep passengers on board. Even after the passengers started getting off; the ramp agents continued to unload bags. I didn't fully realize what had happened until we were in the taxi on our way to the hotel and Flight Attendant 'A' brought it up. We all should have communicated better and the aft door should not have been opened by the ramp until the engines were shut down and it was safe for passengers to deplane.We need to stress the importance of the ramp [personnel] being aware of what is going on around them. The ramp [personnel] are the eyes and ears for flight attendants as we can't always see or hear what is happening outside the aircraft. Also making sure the cabin crew is more observant; not always counting on the ramp [personnel] to give them accurate info.,,Opened main cabin door and found #2 engine still running in cool down mode.

Upon arrival, the seatbelt signs were off, but the door chime was not received. The Ramp Agent opened the aft door, prompting the Flight Attendant to allow passengers to deplane. The pilots had shut down engine #1 but left engine #2 running, awaiting ground power unit connection. The flight attendant, unaware of the running engine, permitted deplaning. Another flight attendant noticed the engine still running and shut it down after passengers had started leaving. Passengers deplaned while engine #2 was running, posing a safety risk. Post-incident, all parties agreed on the need for enhanced communication and awareness. Improve communication and coordination among flight, ground, and cabin crew. Ground personnel should act as the eyes and ears for the flight crew. Cabin crew should enhance their observational skills and not solely rely on ground crew information. This incident highlights the importance of clear communication and situational awareness to prevent similar occurrences.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people"

During cruise flight; First Officer called Lead Flight Attendant (FA#1) to request a trip to the Lavatory. A few minutes later; Lead Flight Attendant called flight deck to advise that it was set up.  The First Officer got up; verified that the area outside of the flight deck door was clear and that the isle was barricaded; then opened the flight deck door.  As I was adjusting the oxygen mask and setting up the comm panel; the Lead Flight Attendant asked if 'so-and-so' could enter the flight deck (instead of the Lead Flight Attendant entering the flight deck) while the First Officer was gone.  In our crew; we had a new Flight Attendant (FA#2); who I had not previously worked with.  When the Lead Flight Attendant asked if 'so-and-so' could enter the flight deck; I assumed that he was asking about the new Flight Attendant as I could not recall her name.  I answered that she may. As I was testing the interphone function of the oxygen mask; I heard the flight deck door close and looked up and was shocked to see an employee of my airline standing on the flight deck with the door closed!  This individual is employed by my airline as a Customer Service Representative (CSR) in my base.  She was wearing her airline uniform and had her ID displayed on an armband.  I was stunned and somewhat shaken to see her and not a Flight Attendant.  I considered having her exit the flight deck immediately; but choose to minimize the flight deck door opening and closing by waiting for the First Officer to return.  Total time with this individual on the flight deck was approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  During this time; she stood in the aft part of the flight deck; adjacent to the flight deck door.  When the First Officer called the flight deck for entry; I had the CSR visually identify the First Officer through the peep hole.  I unlocked the flight deck door and the CSR exited and the First Officer returned and the flight deck door was secured. At no time did I intend to permit access to the flight deck an individual who was not authorized.  It was my understanding that the Lead Flight Attendant had asked if it would be allowable for Flight Attendant #2 to enter the flight deck instead of the Lead Flight Attendant as prescribed.  It was my intent to allow FA#2 to enter the flight deck as this was her second trip and I feel that it is important that the flight attendants are exposed the flight deck environment in the event of an emergency requiring Flight Attendant assistance on the flight deck. After this episode; I asked the Lead Flight Attendant why he would even ask if I would allow access to the flight deck of individual who was not authorized.  He stated that he didn't know that a CSR was not authorized to enter the flight deck.  I suggested that he review his Flight Attendant Manual and informed him that a security breech regarding access to the flight deck is a very serious matter.  He assured me that it would not happen again. This report is submitted to remind all flight crew members that flight deck access procedures are in place to protect the security of the flight crew members and the safety of the aircraft and passengers.,,,,A Captain reported that his Lead Flight Attendant allowed a Customer Service Representative to enter the cockpit while the First Officer went to the lavatory; instead of a Flight Attendant.

FA#1 intended to send Flight Attendant #2 (FA#2), but a Customer Service Representative (CSR) entered instead. The Captain, unaware of the CSR's identity, permitted access, leading to the unauthorized individual being on the flight deck for approximately 3-4 minutes. Upon realizing the error, the Captain addressed FA#1, highlighting the seriousness of the security breach. The outcome emphasized the need to strictly adhere to flight deck access protocols to ensure safety and security. The proposed solution was a reminder to review procedures and ensure only authorized personnel are granted access.","safety related, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

Why? Our inbound flight was delayed more than 2 hours so the turn time was very quick. The Agent was very hurried to get the plane cleaned and get it out ASAP. I was greeting passengers. When they were all boarded; the number three Flight Attendant came to the front to say [that the] exits were briefed. At that point we were all near the front door.The Agent closed the door and pulled the jetway and the Purser said to arm doors. Number three and I then walked to the back of the plane; planning to arm the doors. As I left the front of the plane I realized I had a personal problem. I walked back to get something out of my bag and told my partner I needed to take care of something and went to the lavatory. She; at that time; was also getting something out of the other lavatory for a passenger. When I came out she was in the jumpseat; so I put my bag away and sat down; forgetting to arm my door.Shortly after takeoff; I noticed her door wasn't armed; then looked at mine and realized both doors did not get armed. We then both armed our doors.We later tried to go over the reasons why this happened. I believe the number one reason was trying to rush our departure combined with distractions that happened right as we needed to arm our doors.,,,,Caught up in a maelstrom of activity and the need to address a personal problem as their departure was rushed due to a late arrival; two flight attendants aboard an A320 realized only after takeoff that neither had armed their door for departure.,"The incident occurred when two flight attendants on an A320 failed to arm their respective doors before takeoff. The cause was attributed to a rushed departure due to a delayed flight and a quick turnaround, combined with personal distractions.

As I walked to the back to shut the OHB's the front entry door was closed. An aft Flight Attendant handed me a sweater found on the aircraft during cleaning and I opened the door to hand it to agent and discovered he had pulled back the jetway. I threw the sweater to him and then closed the door.At the time we began our pushback from the gate I had NOT given the Captain our passenger count; learned he had 2 observers in the cockpit and the cockpit door was still open. I had not yet initiated the 'Secure doors for pushback' announcement at the point the aircraft was moving on the ground. I quickly made the PA; waited for appropriate response; provided the count and then closed the door. We quickly attended to our duties including the safety demo only to get interrupted during the middle of it by a cleared for departure announcement from the cockpit. We quickly finished the O2 portion before we took off. The flight proceeded as planned but upon arrival; after observers had left the cockpit; I commented to the Captain that the doors had not been armed when we began pushback. He shared he had told the agent to shut the door. The First Officer later shared with me he had suggested a later wheels up time; but the Captain had said no; to stay with one we had been given. We also had a new hire Flight Attendant on board and I had to explain to her all the things that went WRONG with this experience. Agents should NOT close the door prior to Flight Attendant okay. This situation would not have occurred had the door remained open and the other timing/safety/FAR violations wouldn't have been an issue. In addition; the aircraft should NEVER move on the ground before the cockpit door is shut. The entry door shouldn't be shut before the doors are armed! Captain shouldn't have initiated the closure of the front door; unless he had verified with the lead Flight Attendant.,,,,A lead Flight Attendant detailed numerous failures by cockpit and ground crews to comply with FARs and company SOP during pushback and taxi.,"The incident was triggered by the ground personnel closing the aircraft door prematurely, without the flight attendant's authorization. This occurred while passengers were still boarding and overhead bins were open, leading to subsequent safety protocol violations. The flight attendant attempted to address the situation but faced further issues during pushback. The cockpit door remained open, and the captain had two observers on board without informing the flight crew. The attendant had to make an urgent announcement but did not receive a proper response, affecting the safety briefing and takeoff preparations. Upon arrival, it was discovered that the cockpit doors were not armed during pushback, indicating a clear safety hazard. The incident highlighted multiple failures in adhering to Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) and company Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The flight attendant had to debrief a new hire about the mishandled procedures, emphasizing the importance of compliance with safety protocols. To prevent recurrence, it was suggested that ground personnel should not close the door without explicit approval from the flight attendant. Additionally, the aircraft should not move on the ground until the cockpit door is securely closed and the entry door is properly armed. The captain should verify with the lead flight attendant before initiating any door closures, ensuring all safety measures are in place.","safety related, operational issues, between attendant and other people"

The 'A' Flight Attendant and I told the Captain that we are on our first tray of drinks. We weren't able to take drink orders and pass out peanuts on the ground because as soon as the last passenger boarded the Operations Agent closed the front door. The Captain told us in five minutes it was reported we will fly into turbulence. We (flight attendants) asked the Captain do we need to stop beverage service. The Captain told us to continue to serve the passenger and he will call us back to let us know if it was safe to continue beverage service. Five minutes later the Captain called us and told us to continue service.After the 'A' Flight Attendant finished her last tray; she made a final descent announcement. The 'C' Flight Attendant and I hadn't finished our service. But when 'A' Flight Attendant made the final descent announcement; we stopped serving and went to the aft galley to clean up so we could be seated.The Captain called us and told the 'A' Flight Attendant that he heard her announcement and that we can continue to serve beverages. So the 'C' Flight Attendant and I re-poured our drinks. We (me and 'C' Flight Attendant) didn't realize how close to the ground we were when the Captain called and told us to finish our service. We were past the final descent stage of the flight; but yet the Captain told us to finish beverage service.The Captain never chimed for final descent in the final descent stage of the flight; but yet he chimed us to tell us to finish our beverage service. About two minutes after the captain called us to tell us to finish beverage service; we hit code four turbulence.We had a jumpseater on the jump seat; so the 'C' Flight Attendant got to the other side of the jump seat and I sat on the floor. Meanwhile the trays of beverages started to fall on me. Because we were in the approach stage of the flight with code four turbulence; it caused the trays of beverages to fall on me. The 'C' Flight Attendant made an attempt to make it to the front jump seat.As the plane was going forward; toward the ground; the can of beverages started falling out of the cabinets hitting me. I tried to close the cabinet doors so that the cans of beverages would not hit the jumpseater. Needless to say; I got drench by the drinks that were on the trays; I got hit multiple times by cans of beverages; and the aft galley floor was flooded with beverages.I'm not sure why the Captain told us to finish beverage service while we were in final descent stage of the flight. Maybe he was trying to impress (name) because he was on our flight. But whatever the reason was for the Captain to make such a reckless decision doing a crucial stage of the flight it caused a safety breach because while trying to close the cabinet doors we landed. If it is a 55 minute flight with expected turbulence; then the flight attendants need to remain seated and not do beverages service.,,,,Miscommunication between the Captain and the flight attendants regarding expected turbulence and passenger beverage services resulted in wet floors; wet clothing and exposure to possible injury on the part of those in the cabin.,"The incident occurred during a flight when miscommunication between the captain and the flight attendants regarding expected turbulence and beverage service led to a safety breach. Approximately ten minutes after the 10,000-foot chime, the captain instructed the flight attendants to continue serving beverages despite impending turbulence. The flight attendants were unaware of their proximity to the ground when the captain told them to finish their service, which occurred during the final descent stage. Shortly after, the aircraft encountered Code Four turbulence, causing beverage trays to fall and flood the aft galley. Flight attendants were struck by falling cans and the jumpseater was exposed to potential injury. The captain’s decision to allow beverage service during a critical phase of the flight resulted in a messy and unsafe situation. The flight attendant suggested that flight attendants should remain seated during the final descent if turbulence is expected to avoid such incidents.","communication issues, safety related, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

He then switched us to SOCAL final. We checked in with SOCAL final and were immediately cleared for the visual approach to 24R. We read back the clearance; turned 10 degrees right; and began a descent to the normal 2500 foot alt for the LAX visual. Shortly the controller asked our heading and we responded 150. He said turn left 130. He then asked our altitude. We stated descending through 4500. He asked what our assigned altitude was. We responded that we had been cleared for the visual approach. His response was 'no; you were not cleared for the visual approach; you were told to expect it. Maintain 4000 and turn left to 100.' we responded leveling 4000; heading 100; and we understood we had been cleared for the visual approach and that was the clearance we had read back to him. He then vectored us to final and again cleared us for the visual approach 24R.  Although there was not much traffic; I distinctly heard two different controller voices on SOCAL final. So maybe there was some miscommunication in TRACON. And maybe the controller meant to say expect; but actually said cleared; I've been guilty of that. But I guess the bottom line is we heard the clearance and read it back and received no correction. There was no traffic conflict throughout this incident.  I think the controller(s) just made a mistake.,,,,A Q400 flight crew suffered a breakdown in communications with approach control regarding whether they had been 'cleared for' or were 'to expect' a visual approach to LAX.,"The incident involved a communication breakdown between the Approach Controller and the Q400 flight crew regarding a visual approach clearance to LAX. Initially, the crew was cleared for the visual approach, which they read back and began executing. However, the controller later corrected the crew's altitude and heading, stating they were not cleared for the visual approach but had been told to expect it. The crew, hearing no further correction, adhered to their initial understanding. The confusion may have stemmed from miscommunication in TRACON, as two controller voices were heard on SOCAL final. Despite this, the flight proceeded without traffic conflicts, indicating the issue was a procedural mistake without serious consequences.","communication issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

The safety video had not ended and we had not gone out to do our cabin safety checks. I called the Purser and told him to call the cockpit and tell them that we had not done our cabin safety checks. I went out into the aisle to do my checks. As I worked my way back there was a man with a large briefcase on his lap. I repeatedly told him to stow his briefcase. Just then I hear the engines rev and we started to roll down the runway. I was still standing in the aisle. I ran back to my jumpseat and barely got to sit down and put my seatbelt and shoulder harness on before we lifted off. I waited till 18;000 FT and then called the Purser. I asked him 'Did you call the cockpit and tell them that we were in the aisle doing our cabin safety checks'. He said 'Yes and they said we got to go; we got to go'. I then waited until the seatbelt sign went off and the cockpit finished their announcement to the passengers and called them. The First Officer answered. I asked him: Did the Purser call you and tell you that we were in the aisle doing our cabin safety checks because I was still in the aisle when you took off'. He said to me 'The Purser said give me two seconds. We were on the runway and if we would have pulled off then we would have had to wait 30 minutes'. I again told him 'Well I was still in the aisle when you guys took off. Thank you I just needed to check what had happened.',,,,An A320 crew took off with a flight attendant in the aisle performing the cabin safety check.,"The incident involved a conflict between a flight attendant and the flight crew of an A320 aircraft. The flight attendant was performing cabin safety checks in the aisle when the cockpit instructed the crew to prepare for takeoff. Despite the safety video not being completed and the cabin safety checks not being fully executed, the cockpit proceeded with takeoff. The flight attendant was still in the aisle when the aircraft began rolling down the runway and had to rush to her jumpseat to secure herself before takeoff. After reaching 18,000 feet, she informed the purser, who had communicated with the cockpit. The first officer explained that the cockpit had decided to proceed with takeoff to avoid a 30-minute delay. The incident highlights the need for clear communication and coordination between the cabin and cockpit during pre-takeoff procedures.","safety related, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew, operational issues, communication issues"

The Captain made an announcement saying that we had a problem with the gear not coming down or at least the indication light was illuminated. He landed the plane on the next go around without incident. The crew was not aware that he called an emergency landing until we were taxiing and saw all the emergency vehicles and after talking with the Captain in the crew shuttle bus. I believed the crew should have been informed of this emergency landing and whether or not the bracing signal should have been given.,,,,A Flight Attendant expressed concern that the cabin was not kept advised of an emergency declaration which resulted from a landing gear anomaly.,"The incident occurred due to a landing gear anomaly during a flight, prompting an aborted landing and a 20-minute hold in the air. The flight crew successfully landed the aircraft without further issues. However, the cabin crew were not informed of the emergency until after landing, when they noticed emergency vehicles and discussed the situation with the captain. The flight attendant expressed concern over the lack of communication and suggested that the cabin crew should have been informed about the emergency status and bracing procedures. This incident highlights the importance of timely communication during emergencies to ensure passenger safety and crew preparedness.","safety related, crew-related issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew, emergency"

[We] arrived in ZZZ2 at 2111 with a 02 hour and 35 minute ground time before continuing to operate the 'red-eye' from ZZZ2 to ZZZ3.  I afforded all opportunity to get plenty of rest to prepare for the trip.  I stayed overnight at a nearby hotel; checked out at 1730 and proceeded to the airport for a 1900 check-in.  I completed at least 12 hours of total sleep prior to reporting for the trip.  Upon arrival at ZZZ2 from ZZZ1; I felt pretty good during the 2 hour and 35 minute ground time.  We left ZZZ2 for ZZZ3 at 2345 and both my First Officer and I felt alert.  About half way to ZZZ3; both my First Officer and I experienced the onset of fatigue.Symptoms included yawning; short naps; head nod; and reduced concentration.  We missed several radio calls from ATC.  I attempted to combat fatigue by placing the overhead cockpit lights to bright; but this reduced our outside visibility; then I selected DIM on the lights.  This helped initially; but we both continued to suffer from the effects of fatigue.  I had the flight attendant call us every 15 minutes to ensure we were alert.  Once we started our descent and approach into ZZZ3; our alertness increased.  This is due to the increased task of preparing for the arrival.  Total duty period was 11 hours and 8 minutes.I suggest the company not schedule more than one flight activity when spanning the hours of 0200-0500.  When a red-eye is scheduled as the only activity; I do much better since I can rest all the way up to report time.  Having to complete flying activity prior to the red-eye; coupled with a sit time in ZZZ2; is a recipe for disaster.  Even after I had afforded all opportunity to rest prior to the event; I experienced fatigue during cruise.  Had the effects degraded further than experienced; I would have had no choice but to divert to a location well short of our destination to get proper rest before continuing.,,,,An air carrier Captain related the debilitating effects of fatigue resulting from back side of the clock scheduling including extended breaks between flight segments.,"The incident involved a flight crew experiencing fatigue due to backside-of-the-clock scheduling, which led to reduced alertness and performance during a red-eye flight. The captain and first officer reported symptoms of fatigue, including yawning, short naps, and reduced concentration, which began approximately halfway through the flight. These symptoms caused them to miss several radio calls from air traffic control (ATC). The crew attempted to mitigate fatigue by adjusting cockpit lighting and having the flight attendant check on their alertness every 15 minutes. Alertness improved as the flight approached its destination due to increased pre-arrival tasks. The captain recommended that the company avoid scheduling multiple flight activities between 0200-0500 and instead allow rest periods before red-eye flights to prevent fatigue-related risks.","safety related, crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

There apparently was a delay in takeoff due to unknown reasons and this was not communicated by the cockpit to the flight attendant's. Because of the delay; safety checks were completed another time to ensure customers were in compliance before takeoff. While safety checks were being completed the pilots had initiated takeoff without making the announcement 'flight attendants prepare for takeoff'. One flight attendant was not close to their assigned jumpseat and had to take closest available jumpseat for safety.,,During taxi out we prepared cabin for take off. After an extremely long taxi and wait I felt that it was necessary to prepare cabin again for take off. I was at door 1 left and out of nowhere the engines roared up and we began our take off roll. After being stunned I immediately strapped into jumpseat position #4 and we took off. When it was safe I returned to my position. This could have been avoided if the pilots would have given us a prepare for take off. Now apparently the reason we didn't get it was that ATC had lost our flight plan and we taxied around for a long time. It's my understanding this is what distracted the pilots from giving us the take off warning.,,Several flight attendants reported their flight began the takeoff roll following an extensive ground delay with no PA from the flight deck announcing the takeoff was imminent.,"During a flight, a delay occurred on the tarmac due to air traffic control (ATC) issues, which were not communicated to the flight attendants by the cockpit. As a result, the flight attendants conducted additional safety checks. However, the pilots initiated takeoff without issuing the standard ""prepare for takeoff"" announcement. One flight attendant, not near their assigned jumpseat, had to quickly secure the nearest available seat. The flight attendant suggested that proper communication from the cockpit could have prevented the situation.

We conducted FL180 and below checklist with exception of altimeter setting. I informed Captain I would be off frequency to get arrival ATIS. He handled all communication during this time while hand flying the aircraft (autopilot not used). Very long ATIS due to air show requirements. I returned to frequency and as I looked up; I saw the altitude selector at 11;000 FT (per clearance) but aircraft was leveling 10;000 FT. Center at that point asked our altitude. I heard the Captain say; 'my bad I missed it.' I responded to Center; 'returning to 11;000 FT.' Captain returned to 11;000 FT and flight continued to our destinataion without further incident; but extremely busy due to high volume radio and aircraft traffic. I fly as a contract pilot with this company and am quite familiar with aircraft FMS/EFIS; and NAV systems but note the Captain tends to hand fly the aircraft in the highest traffic; highest work load times. Numerous times I have had to call out 'altitude' when he was flying and going off assigned altitude. I have pointed this out but Captain said nothing and evidently won't change his procedure. I will fly with him in the future but will encourage autopilot use and monitor his climb and descent profiles closely.,,,,A First Officer reported leaving ATC frequency to get the ATIS and upon his return discovered the hand flying Captain leveling at 10;000 FT with Altitude Alerter at 11;000 FT. ATC called and they climbed back to 11;000 FT.,"The incident occurred during a flight to an air show where the first officer left the ATC frequency to retrieve the ATIS. Upon returning, the first officer noticed the captain had leveled off at 10,000 feet despite the altitude selector being set to 11,000 feet. ATC contacted the flight, prompting the captain to correct the altitude and resume the flight without further issues. The high workload and manual flying by the captain were identified as contributing factors. The first officer had previously highlighted the captain's tendency to hand-fly during busy times, resulting in altitude deviations. To mitigate this, the first officer planned to encourage autopilot use and closely monitor the captain's flight profiles in the future.","crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

Flight attendants were not aware that the Captain was armed (due to lack of briefing by the Captain and lack of CLR). The FAMs did not know the Captain was armed (due to lack of CLR and proper briefing with Captain) and in turn the Captain was unaware of the presence of FAMs on the flight. In addition I as Purser was completely distracted from my boarding and Pre-Departure duties. I was not able to provide any safety and security vigilance that is expected of me during the boarding process. This was all due to the fact that our Captain became upset over me serving him his coffee with cream on the side instead of inside the coffee. As the result of this a confrontation ensued between myself and the Captain that lasted throughout the boarding process. The action taken by the Captain and the inflight supervisor was to remove me from the Purser position. My flying partner took over being Purser to appease the Captain. However that did not change the fact that the working crew (both flight attendants and cockpit) was unaware of the armed FAMs onboard and as well as the FAMs were unaware that the Captain was armed.,,,,An air carrier Flight Attendant reported flight attendants and pilots were both unaware that FAMs were on board; and the flight attendants and FAMs were unaware the Captain was an FFDO.  Problem reportedly stemmed from lack of communication resulting from friction between the purser and the Captain before departure.,"The incident occurred due to a lack of communication and briefing between the flight crew, specifically the purser, and the captain. The purser was unaware of the presence of armed Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) on board and the fact that the captain was an FFDO (Federal Flight Deck Officer). Similarly, the FAMs were also unaware of the captain's status. The issue originated from a disagreement between the purser and the captain regarding the serving of coffee, which distracted the purser from their duties and led to a confrontation during the boarding process. As a result, the captain and in-flight supervisor removed the purser from their position, and the purser's partner took over. However, the lack of communication and briefing between the flight crew, cockpit, and FAMs remained unresolved, creating a security risk during the flight. The incident highlights the need for improved communication and briefing protocols to ensure awareness and coordination among all crew members.","communication issues, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew"

Approx 5 min later First Officer received a call from the cabin that the passenger passed out in the Flight Attendant's arms and that they were searching for medical professional on board.  Before the First Officer was able to get any additional information the Flight Attendant that called hung up.  The First Officer briefed me on the current situation. I instructed him to prepare for a possible diversion.  I got the ops freq for him and we set the FMS for the diversion. I then took over ATC comm and instructed the First Officer to get more information from the Flight Attendants on the age/sex of passenger name or seat assignment etc in case we needed to make a medical phone patch call. While he was talking to the Flight Attendant I informed ATC of our situation and the possibility of diverting for an unknown medical situation with a passenger that has passed out in the cabin.  The First Officer got in touch with one of the Flight Attendant and received some basic information that the passenger was female; non English speaking; vomiting and abdominal pains with two RN's evaluating her. The Flight Attendant then hung up on the First Officer again.  The First Officer briefed me on the information he received and informed me that in his opinion that both Flight Attendants were in a panic. The First Officer and I discussed the situation and I instructed him that we were 45 min from landing in ZZZ2 or 10 min from ZZZ.  We both agreed we needed more info from the Flight Attendants and RN before beginning our diversion.  I received instruction from ATC to descend to FL320 and switch to another ATC controller.  I checked in with that ATC controller and advised him of the situation of a possible diversion to ZZZ after we received additional information from the cabin on the condition of the passenger. During my conversation with ATC I heard the First Officer inform the Flight Attendant that she needed to ask the RNs for more information on the condition of the passenger; needed a seat assignment at least; and to tell the RN's that we needed a decision whether to continue to ZZZ2 that will take 40 min or divert to ZZZ that will take 10 min. When the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant I informed him of our decent to FL 320 and switched to another center freq.  We again discussed the situation with the Flight Attendant and finished preparations for diversion to ZZZ.  First Officer got ATIS and we set up for landing on RWY 23 in ZZZ.  First Officer then received a call from the Flight Attendant with seat assignment of passenger and that the RN's agreed that it would be best to divert to ZZZ.  When I heard that on the Interphone I informed ATC of or need to divert to ZZZ for a medical emergency. ATC gave  us a left descending turn to direct ZZZ. I informed ATC that we wanted paramedics; ambulance to meet the Aircraft for a female passenger in her mid 30's with abdominal pains and vomiting. After the First Officer got off with the Flight Attendant. I brief him of our ATC instructions; asked him to call the company and instruct them that we will be diverting to ZZZ for a medical emergency and to pass on the information to our dispatcher and that we will call him on the ground in ZZZ.  We then completed all checklist and when we contacted ZZZ Approach Control were given straight in to Rwy XX.  We landed 10 min after beginning our descent on Rwy XX and in the Gate; 2 min after landing.  Paramedics took the passenger off the plane and she was transported to a local hospital.  The First Officer suggested that he talk to the Flight Attendant's on the situation to evaluate whether we should continue the flight to ZZZ2 with them.  I agreed.  (First Officer is a certified paramedic) I contacted dispatch and gave him all the information I had and while I was on the phone with him I was handed thepassenger boarding stub with the passenger's name and passed it onto dispatch.  After I finished my call with Dispatch a Flight Attendant came up to the cockpit. I asked her if there was anything used as far as emergency equip the passenger. She informed me that just the stethoscope and blood pressure cuff out of the EEMK [Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit] were used and replaced into the kit.  The First Officer returned to the cockpit and informed me that he talked to both the Flight Attendants and they were more relaxed and he felt that they were capable to continue the flight to ZZZ2 and back to ZZZ.  A few min later Flight Attendant 1 brought up one of the Flight Attendant O2 bottles and informed me that they had to give the passenger O2 and that the bottle pressure was below 1500 psi. I was a little disgusted and informed her that it needed to be replaced or serviced before we can leave ZZZ. I told her that I needed to know all the equipment that was used for this passenger; and should have be told of this when I asked the first time. (Note at this time the paramedics had already removed the passenger and we had been on the ground for about 15 min.) I called Maintenance Control about the O2 bottle and later discussed swapping the O2 bottle with the other CRJ9 that was overnighting.  Contract Maintenance did show up at the aircraft and serviced the O2 bottle. After contract Maintenance had finished the servicing of the O2 bottle and took the maintenance logbook to sign off the writeup the first officer and I prepared the aircraft for departure.  The next two flights were uneventful.  After returning back to ZZZ for the overnight I was performing my shutdown checklist when the Flight Attendant presented me the inventory checklist for the EEMK [Emergency Medical Kit] and First Aid Kit.  I again was disgusted.  The EEMK showed that the all items were in the EEMK but she had checked that it was incomplete and serviceable. One of the First Aid Kits was used and the latex gloves were used and the kit was incomplete. I informed her that this inventory should have been completed before we left ZZZ for ZZZ2 and I should have been informed when I asked her if any emergency equipment was used of the O2 bottle and the latex gloves were used.  I then called Maintenance Control to defer the First Aid Kit and after discussing the EEMK with him he decided to defer both the EEMK and the First Aid Kit that were used.  I left the Aircraft at XA:30 local time.,,,,A CRJ diverted to a nearby airport in response to a passenger medical emergency.  The Captain expressed some concern about the professionalism of the Cabin Attendants' familiarity with the administrative aspects of the aircraft emergency equipment.,"The incident involved a CRJ aircraft diverting to a nearby airport due to a female passenger experiencing a medical emergency, including vomiting and abdominal pains. The flight crew received initial reports from the cabin about the passenger's condition, followed by a request for medical assistance. The cabin crew's communication was described as panicked, with incomplete information provided during initial contacts. The flight crew prepared for the diversion, informed air traffic control (ATC), and requested emergency services at the diversion airport. The aircraft landed at ZZZ, where paramedics transported the passenger to a hospital. Following the landing, the flight crew discovered that emergency oxygen equipment had been used and was not properly serviced. The Captain expressed concern over the cabin crew's handling of the situation and their communication regarding the use of emergency equipment. Maintenance was called to service the oxygen bottle and defer the First Aid Kit, which had been used during the incident. The flight crew also reviewed the inventory of the Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit (EEMK) and found discrepancies in its contents. The flight resumed to its final destination, with no further issues reported during the remainder of the journey. The incident highlighted concerns about the cabin crew's familiarity with administrative procedures related to emergency equipment usage and their communication during critical situations.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, emergency, operational issues, equipment malfunction, health and medical issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers"

We cancelled the push and discovered the passenger had self-reported having the flu and being very ill. I made the decision to remove the Passenger and coordinated with customer service and Dispatch.   After landing; mid galley Flight Attendant reported that when she went to disarm door; she realized she had never re-armed the door after passenger removal. Flight Attendant filling out report. According to all (including mother and daughter of passenger who was removed); the passenger was visibly 'not well' by all accounts.  She never should have been allowed to board the airplane; particularly with all of the information available on influenza and public health risks. The distraction to the Flight Attendant caused by the return of the jetway and removal of the passenger caused a departure with door 2L unarmed. The increase in risk of not being able to get off the airplane in the event of an evacuation could have been avoided by a quick screening of the passengers boarding our airplanes.,,,,A Flight Attendant realized after arrival she had not armed a door because of distractions related to removing an ill passenger at departure time.,"An incident occurred during a flight involving a sick passenger with the flu.

Upon landing, the Flight Attendant discovered that she had failed to re-arm door 2L due to distractions caused by the passenger removal process. This oversight posed a risk in the event of an evacuation. The incident highlighted the potential consequences of not adequately screening passengers for health risks, particularly concerning contagious illnesses like influenza. A quick passenger screening process was suggested to prevent similar incidents in the future.","between attendant and passengers, health and medical issues, operational issues, equipment malfunction"

I was in the galley next to door two and there had been a jetbridge at door one.  When the door closed I knew that there was an agent on board still so I thought that there was a jetbridge at door one.  I didn't even realize that we had begun to push back until I heard a commotion and saw the Customer Service Agent in the aisle saying that someone needed to call the cockpit and tell them to go back to the gate and I looked out the window to see that we had begun to be pushed back.  We returned to the gate the Agent got off and when the jetbridge pulled away that time I armed my door and made the PA to arm doors to the rest of the crew.,,I was working Flight Attendant #6 in economy walking around closing bins; my exit row had been briefed as it was getting close to departure. I went to verify with my flying partner #5 is she had a chance to brief her exit row so that I could relay the message to the purser so that way he knew the exits at 4L&R were briefed. She had not done her exits and I started to go back to brief her exit (and I completed the briefing for her) and I thought I saw something moving outside. I was unsure if the plane was moving or if it was ground crew. I then noticed the aircraft was moving and asked did anyone hear arm doors? My flying partner at 3R said no she armed 3L&R. I went back to arm 4L&R as we were pushing back. I then ask about the agent that I saw in conomy that she was still on the plane. The captain came over the PA said we were going back to the gate to let the Gate Agent off the aircraft after they radioed to operations they were onboard. I then heard disarm doors. Then a minute or so later I hear arm doors and we continue with the flight. I ask my flying partners what happened that was in business they said the door was just shut without them being told it was ok. I asked one of the flying partners about how was cabin ready given when the doors were not armed. They did not know.,,In the quest for an on-time departure; B747 flight attendants report door closure and pushback commencement with a Customer Service Agent still on board.,"An incident occurred involving a B747 flight where a miscommunication led to a gate agent remaining onboard during the plane's pushback. The flight attendants were distracted, with one not arming the door or making an announcement, believing the jetbridge was still in place. The other attendant, focused on exit row procedures, noticed movement and realized the plane was moving without proper communication. The flight crew responded by returning to the gate to allow the agent to disembark, then arming the doors and resuming the flight. The incident highlighted the need for improved communication and protocols to prevent similar occurrences.","communication issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

The biohazard guys came on and found that a young boy had a temperature of 38.7; 38 being normal. They decided to quarantine him; his row; the rows in front and back of him; and something like 6 flight attendants; who had served him. One of them told a language speaker that a doctor was coming and would check him on board.  After about 20 minutes; the station manager finally showed up and said that to protect their departure on the 13th; the Chinese authorities would accept just one Flight Attendant. She didn't want to speak to me; and tried to ignore me; but I got involved in the conversation and asked where the doctor was; since this boy was only a fraction of a degree above normal; which may be normal for him. She didn't have a clue; and suddenly didn't seem to understand English anymore.  The purser and I asked her how they were going to determine which Flight Attendant would be quarantined. She said we should choose. We both said we would not do that; that we had no right to order someone to go into quarantine. She said then she would choose. When I asked her what she would do when that person refused; she again didn't understand English. I guess she's not used to people not obeying her.  Finally; the Purser said he would stay. I applaud him for doing that; but what makes this even more bizarre is that he never came into contact with the boy. I asked that station manager why not just send a customer service agent to go with the quarantined people; since they are local and speak the language. She didn't seem to understand my question...again.  Now here's the safety issue:  One of our crew members; who was completely healthy; was forced to go to a non-western hotel; where sick people were being held in quarantine; and given no bottled water (only purification tablets to use with tap water). What if he now gets sick?,,,,An air carrier Captain reported a verbal clash between bio-hazard personnel in ZSPD and flight attendants who had been exposed to a young man who was being quarantined due to the possibility he may have an infectious disease.,"The incident occurred at ZSPD when a young boy with a temperature of 38.7°C was quarantined, along with his row and six flight attendants who had served him. Biohazard personnel, led by a station manager, enforced these measures. The manager initially stated that only one flight attendant could depart, causing a conflict with the flight crew. The crew refused to select someone for quarantine, leading the manager to decide. The purser volunteered to stay, despite not being in contact with the boy. The Captain questioned why a customer service agent couldn't accompany the quarantined individuals, but the manager didn't respond. A safety concern arose as a healthy crew member was sent to a hotel with sick individuals, provided only with purification tablets and tap water. The purser's decision to stay and the Captain's suggestion for customer service involvement highlighted the need for improved quarantine protocols.","health and medical issues, crew-related issues, communication issues, safety related, operational issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and other people"

During briefing I sat next to the aft purser and I smelled alcohol on his breath. I spoke with my flying partner as I was unsure what course of action to take. Once I boarded the plane I spoke with the purser and said I smelled alcohol on the Aft Purser's breath and she said; 'Yes I did also and I said something to him.' When I asked how he reacted she said he really didn't react. As we began boarding I became more uncomfortable about the lack of action taken regarding this. I spoke again with my flying partner and he agreed I needed to tell the Captain and the First Officer.  The Captain asked to have the Purser sent up to the cockpit. She spoke with both pilots and confirmed what I had said and that she; too; had smelled alcohol on his breath. She also stated it was difficult in her culture to be assertive with a Japanese man. The Captain asked her to send up the Aft Purser. As the Purser and I exited the cockpit she pulled me aside and said; 'why did you have to say anything'? Now I was feeling extremely uncomfortable. I started to shake; wishing I hadn't said anything.  The last thing I wanted to do as an out of base crewmember is alienate my flying partners. The Aft Purser spoke with the cockpit; then proceeded throughout the flight to not speak to me and to get the aft galley's needed supplies through other flight attendants. I went back to the cockpit and the Captain advised me that since the Aft Purser had popped a mint prior to entering the cockpit he couldn't really smell alcohol and that he didn't notice any unusual behavior such as slurred speech or stumbling and he was OK with him flying. I told the Captain whatever he decided was fine with me; I was just doing my job and keeping everyone apprised of the situation in case anything happened. If I had taken the Purser position in briefing the outcome would have been different. I would have confronted the Aft Purser in the office and given him 2 choices ... go on sick leave or we go talk to the domicile manager or supervisor. I feel this situation was completely downplayed and I was made to feel like I was making a big thing out of nothing and this is unacceptable as a safety professional.,,,,Believing the Aft Purser to have been drinking alcohol; a Flight Attendant is distressed that she failed to receive support from her cabin crewmates for her pleas for investigation prior to departure.,"An incident occurred on a flight where a flight attendant detected the smell of alcohol on the Aft Purser during briefing. Concerned for safety, she discussed her observations with her flying partner and later informed the Captain and First Officer. The Captain requested the Aft Purser to the cockpit, where the Purser confirmed smelling alcohol but stated the Aft Purser didn't exhibit signs of intoxication. The Captain allowed the Aft Purser to fly, citing the use of a mint and no visible signs of impairment. The Aft Purser potentially being under the influence of alcohol, detected by a flight attendant.The flight attendant addressed her concerns with crew and management, leading to a cockpit consultation. The Aft Purser denied impairment, and the Captain permitted him to fly. The flight attendant felt unsupported and disrespected, while the Aft Purser avoided her, highlighting crew dynamics and cultural barriers. The main character felt her concerns were dismissed, indicating a potential flaw in handling safety issues. She proposed a direct approach if in a leadership role, suggesting a need for stronger protocols to ensure safety and crew support.This incident underscores the challenges in addressing safety concerns within a crew, emphasizing the importance of clear procedures and respectful communication to ensure passenger safety.","safety related, crew-related issues, between attendant and crew, operational issues"

They were looking at seat ABX and asked if the armrest came up.  I informed them that it did not; but that the one on ABY did.  They were happy because they were able to switch seats making me realize that they were ticketed for seats ABXY and the man was unable to get into the seat without the armrest coming up.  I located the button and lifted the armrest.  Afterwards I immediately called another attendant to inform her that we very likely had a passenger that qualified under the company's new rule about passengers of size.  She was the attendant greeting passengers and she would be the first one to have contact with a customer service agent to inform them of the problem. The flight was booked oversold by 12.  Therefore we pretty much knew the flight would be full when addressing the passenger of size issue.  The customer service agents came down to the plane later in the boarding process to check carry-on bags.  As soon as I could get through the aisle I spoke to one of them about the passenger of size.  Instead of taking care of the problem themselves they immediately called for a supervisor to handle it.  During this time there were two customer service agents at the plane but none of them would approach the passenger until a supervisor finally showed up. One of the agents did eventually go speak to the passenger about having to take a later flight.  She returned to the boarding door to tell us that the passenger did not want to take a later flight.  They were then going to remove two non-revenue space available passengers who were sitting together towards the front of the plane.  They were going to move the passenger of size to the two seats. Again the agent went back to tell the passenger and again she returned this time saying that the passenger did not want to switch seats.  She then added that if he did not want to change seats we could not force him to do so.  This directly contradicts the company's passenger of size policy. The purser made me feel guilty when they tried to remove the non-revenue space available passengers from the flight.  I also felt guilty since my intention was not to have anyone unrelated to the situation removed from the flight.  However this was both a policy and safety issue.  Multiple people (employees) asked if any of the passengers near the passenger of size had complained which they had not.  The response that I got was that I was creating the problem and that if no one complained it was not even an issue. Again this is contradictory to the passenger of size policy.  The criteria are not based on whether anyone complains.  It is based on safety issues.  The customer service agents did not seem to want to do anything about it and I was being made to feel that I was creating a problem and why was I doing that?  I finally gave in and dropped the issue.  They shut the door and all of the passengers remained in their original seats. As a result of this passenger's size and the seat that he was in (that he refused to move from) the aisle armrest was up for the entire flight including for taxi; take-off and landing.  This was very frustrating.  The company has a policy in place to prevent this.  Instead of following it I was made to feel as if I had created a problem by almost everyone involved from the customer service agents to the customer service supervisor and even by one of my flying partners. Also as part of the policy both the customer service agents and flight attendants are supposed to be proactive.  In this case it was an oversold flight.  It is almost impossible that the customer service agents did not notice his size during boarding.  It makes me wonder why they did not look into the issue at that point.  During the flight half of the passenger's body was out in the aisle.  I tripped over him (he was genuinely apologetic). At another point during the flight there was a traffic jam of passengers in the aisle because they could not get by this passenger.  The thought that came to mind was that if there was a medical emergency I was not sure if we would be able to quickly get down the aisle because half of this person's body was in the aisle. If policy was followed this situation never would have occurred.  Instead I was made to feel guilty and treated as if I was creating a problem because I wanted to follow safety and policy.,,,,Flight Attendant reports she received no support when she attempted to invoke the airline's policy regarding passengers of size.,"The incident occurred on an oversold flight where a passenger of size caused seating issues. The flight attendant attempted to address the problem by switching seats and informing customer service agents, but they did not proactively resolve the situation, leading to the armrest remaining up throughout the flight. This resulted in safety concerns and a congested aisle. The attendant felt unsupported and guilted by the customer service team, despite the company's policy to prevent such situations.","passenger-related issues, crew-related issues, safety related, between attendant and other people"

Approaching FIR received ATC message time-stamped XA:35Z instructing we contact ATC frequency 124.XX MHZ.  Crew acknowledged ATC instructions via CPDLC at time XA:35Z; and attempted voice contact per ATC instructions.  ATC MESSAGE EICAS memo message and SENDING CDU prompt remained displayed for what would be a period of 6 minutes.  After time-out period; CDU displayed ATC MESSAGE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED.  During this time interval crew unsuccessfully attempted contact ATC 124.XX MHZ. ATC sent a second datalink message after the auto-generated ATC MESSAGE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED FMC alert message. This read: 'Attempt voice contact ATC'.  There was no PRINT or SEND prompt to this second datalink communication; and this message was not recorded in the CPDLC log.  However; either this second ATC datalink message; or-- more probably-- the timing out of the first message; allowed programming logic to re-enable CDU send prompt; which the PF immediately selected.  This second response (to the first ATC message) is time-stamped XA:41Z.  Meanwhile the pilot not flying was successful with voice relay through aircraft on frequency to ATC; and voice communications were soon established with ATC on an alternate frequency.  The airplane ACARS system processes all Company and ATC datalink messages to and from the airplane.  At time XA:39Z we received; on ACARS; the first of three cabin write-up acknowledgments called in presumably by the Chief Purser.  Crew's observation is this co-incidental occupation of FMC datalink processor/buffering delayed ATC datalink communication.  As a crewmember on international flights; I have long been frustrated by some Chief Purser's habits of sending non-essential cabin items both without coordinating this activity with the flight crew on duty; and/or initiating sending no essential cabin items so early in the flight.  FOM states 'Purser will consult with Captain prior to using ACARS'.  Some do not.  Some are briefed; as happened on this occasion; by a Captain during preflight briefing; that using ACARS is appropriate and approved by the Captain.  This leaves timing of ACARS usage to the sole discretion of the Chief purser; and its use may very well be at a time in flight that the Captain never imagined. Additionally; Pursers are not trained to envision how cabin write-ups affect the dispatch ability of an aircraft in event of diversion.  I am not suggesting these write-ups not be recorded for the above reason; I am suggesting; however; that legality of dispatch makes it ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT that the Captain be advised IMMEDIATELY prior to using the cabin ACARS.  At any rate; if indeed the use of the cabin ACARS interfered with ATC communications; as it appears it did; a wholly unacceptable-- an unnecessary-- communication interruption can occur.  The use of the cabin ACARS must be limited to non-controller pilot datalink communications/ADS operations.  I believe this report is particularly important given a recent fleet communication regarding timeliness of aircrew responses to CPDLC instructions from ATC.,,I was the Captain on this flight. I was in the bunk asleep during this matter. I had briefed the Chief Purser that she could use the cabin ACARS for cabin write ups. The aircraft was approaching FIR and was given a CPDLC message to contact ATC on 124.XX. The relief pilots were unable to acknowledge this and the message timed out. In the mean time they had relayed communications through another aircraft and eventually got in contact on 124.XX. We believe the message could not get through to CPDLC because at the same time the Chief Purser was sending in cabin write-ups on the cabin ACARS. I need to make sure to have the Purser check with me for the appropriate time to do the cabin ACARS as this caused a delay in our being able to communicate with ATC.,,A pilot reported that the Flight Attendants use of the cabin ACARS during international operations interfered with CPDLC/ADS communications with ATC.,"The incident involved a conflict between the flight crew, Air Traffic Control (ATC), and a flight attendant during international operations. ATC transmitted a message instructing the crew to contact a specific frequency, but the crew faced difficulties acknowledging this due to interference from cabin ACARS usage. The flight attendant used the cabin ACARS to send cabin write-ups, coinciding with the timing out of the ATC message. This interference led to a delay in establishing communication with ATC. The proposed solution is to restrict cabin ACARS usage to non-controller communications and require the purser to consult the captain before using it, ensuring coordination and preventing future disruptions.","operational issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

I noted he was very excited; speaking with a difficult to understand accent; and coughing. I got out of my seat to look through the cockpit door peephole and witnessed the front several rows of passengers reaching for their masks and covering their mouths to breath. The First Officer declared an emergency with ATC and we immediately diverted to the nearest suitable airport. Total descent time was approx. 6-7 minutes. After landing it was determined that the fumes had decreased and the air had cleared. We taxied to the gate; deplaned and notified company of our location and situation.,Reporter stated that four passengers were taken to the hospital for examination and were released. Later investigation determined that a single passenger; an employee of another airline; had smelled something 'unusual' and decided to unilaterally access her PSU manually to obtain oxygen masks for herself and a companion. Doing so actuated the oxygen generator; alarmed other passengers; who attempted to access masks for themselves; engaged the concern of the Flight Attendants who attempted to assist them in accessing their oxygen masks; which resulted in more O2 generators being activated; more heat generated and the generation of a white haze; a by-product of the high heat emitted by the generators.  By the time the Cabin Attendants advised the Flight Crew the air at the top of the cabin was; indeed; full of 'smoke'; the passengers were scrambling to access their masks and the reporting Flight Attendant was alarmed and wearing a portable O2 mask while attempting to transmit on the interphone. The combined effect when viewed through the cockpit peep hole was of a near panic situation with visible smoke in the cabin.  The result was the declaration of the emergency and the diversion to the nearest suitable airport.,,,An A319 declared an emergency and diverted due to smoke in the cabin.,"The incident occurred when an A319 aircraft experienced the automatic deployment of oxygen masks in the front cabin section due to toxic fumes and haze.

The #2 engine's vibration gauge started to slowly increase into the abnormal range. We ran the QRH; and were only able to maintain the normal range at approximately 70% power setting. Because that thrust setting was too low to maintain cruise flight at FL 320; we determined it was necessary to divert to ZZZ. The flight continued with no other problems and a normal landing was accomplished. We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance to discuss the problem. After telling Dispatch where we were and that we needed an airport for diversion ZZZ was selected as the new destination airport and ATC was advised. An Emergency was declared. During the discussions; Maintenance Control advised us to follow the QRH and shut down the #2 engine. We asked multiple questions; but the only answer given was to follow the QRH. I asked the Maintenance Control person if he was even looking at the QRH for this problem and he admitted he wasn't. I asked him to reference the QRH with me. They still persisted to follow the QRH. We asked to speak with a Chief Pilot and the Program Manager; but our Dispatcher told us none were available and that a phone patch wouldn't work. During this conversation with Maintenance; we learned that the #2 engine had experienced this same problem the week before; and that the wrong engine had been fixed.  The rationale for our decision to forgo engine shutdown was the first caution note; printed in bold; in the QRH for Engine Fan Vibration which states; 'It is not recommended that an engine be shut down unless there is another indication of a severe engine abnormality; i.e; high oil temperature; high oil pressure or abnormal vibration is felt through the airframe.' All other engine gauges and parameters were normal and comparable to the left engine.  We did not feel any vibration through the air frame.  We also discussed that in the descent; the thrust would be back and would most likely remain in the normal range.  The descent was initiated for the diversion and we were able to control the vibration all the way to landing at ZZZ thus not needing an engine shut-down. Even though both the Captain and I had talked with the flight attendants about the diversion and possible engine problem; they never mentioned that the engine sounded louder than normal.  It wasn't until we were on the ground; that the aft Flight Attendant said that there was a louder than normal sound coming from the engine.  Recommendation Regarding Contract Maintenance. We decided not to fly the aircraft out of ZZZ due to multiple findings; including:  1) the fact that we couldn't verify the aircraft was legal to fly after corrective work had been performed on the wrong engine; 2) the very poor inspection done by contract maintenance. Even other ground crew personnel told us that they should not be trusted. It is our belief that the Contract Maintenance person never inspected the #2 engine. (We had questioned him how he looked at the blades and if he opened up the cowling.  He said he didn't open the cowling and that he had used the belt loader because a ladder wouldn't be tall enough to reach the engine.  We mentioned the belt loader was not on that side of the aircraft and he laughed and then stated 'You couldn't see anything from examining the blades anyway.'  (Yet he wrote in the corrective action of the log book that he inspected the blades).  The only time we were able to communicate with this person was when he finally came up to the cockpit for the run-up. After the run-up; he concluded that the engine was fine; and that we were good to go. Back at the gate; he took the maintenance book to sign off the engine; but had to come back and find out which engine we experienced trouble with. (This contradicts the fact he wrote that he inspected the blades. Had he inspected the blades; he would've known which engine had the vibe).  A decision to not use these contract maintenance personnel should be highly considered. Always get a Chief Pilot when requested.  We are encouraged from day one of CRM to utilize all our resources and we requested these resources but were denied access to them.  Maintenance Control often appears 'disengaged' to the problems the crew is encountering and the only answer they give to any questions for help or problem solving is 'Follow the QRH' even when presented with contradictory or unclear QRH procedures to follow.  Isn't maintenance there to help be a useful resource and problem solve?  Don't use this contract maintenance provider in the future.,,,,High engine vibration indications initiated an ongoing exchange with the commuter airline's dispatch and maintenance control organizations that the reporter deemed ineffective. Flight diverted and canceled,"The incident involved a flight crew encountering engine vibration issues, leading to a diversion and cancellation. After takeoff, the #2 engine's vibration gauge indicated abnormal levels, prompting the crew to follow the QRH. However, the suggested power settings were inadequate for cruising, necessitating a diversion to ZZZ. Communication with Maintenance Control was deemed ineffective, as they failed to provide meaningful assistance beyond directing the crew to adhere to the QRH. The crew elected not to shut down the engine, as the vibration was not severe enough, and successfully landed at ZZZ. Post-landing, the crew learned that a flight attendant had noticed a louder engine noise, which the crew had not detected. The crew identified multiple issues with the contract maintenance, including a prior incorrect engine repair and a lack of thorough inspection. The maintenance team's unprofessional conduct and inability to competently inspect the engine led the crew to cancel the flight from ZZZ. The crew recommended against using the contract maintenance provider and criticized Maintenance Control for its disengagement and lack of problem-solving support. The flight was ultimately diverted and canceled due to these maintenance and communication shortcomings.","safety related, operational issues, equipment malfunction, communication issues, between attendant and crew"

EMERGENCY ACCESS FROM CABIN SIDE IS NOT AVAILABLE. C. cockpit two person rule must be observed.' I informed the purser of my concerns for SAFETY before briefing and he called maintenance.  He was informed that there is a code that the pilot can give for alternative access. I briefed with the Captain of any alternative ways for a SAFETY stand point and he stated that there is not any way to access the door under emergency basis at all. I didn't feel comfortable flying on a plane that I wasn't able to access the cockpit for emergency basis on for SAFETY. I called the crew desk immediately to inform them of my SAFETY concerns. I have been charged with a Did Not Fly action and delay of the aircraft for my SAFETY concerns. I hope that my safety issue is addressed for future administrative corrections and hope no one else will have to go through the difficulties that I feel I am being given to defend my integrity of being a SAFETY professional.,,,,A Flight Attendant reported concerns about lack of emergency cockpit access when the keypad entry system to the cockpit was deferred.,"The incident involved a Flight Attendant who reported concerns regarding a safety issue related to cockpit access. The Flight Attendant noticed a maintenance defect on the keypad entry system to the cockpit, which was inoperative and rendered the cockpit door inaccessible from the cabin side. This raised safety concerns, as the Flight Attendant would be unable to access the cockpit in an emergency. The Flight Attendant informed the purser about their concerns, who then contacted maintenance. Maintenance responded by stating that the pilot could provide a code for alternative access, but during a briefing with the Captain, it was clarified that no such alternative access was available under emergency conditions. Uncomfortable with the safety risk, the Flight Attendant contacted the crew desk to report their concerns. As a result, the Flight Attendant was charged with a ""Did Not Fly"" action, leading to a delay in the aircraft. The Flight Attendant expressed hope that the safety issue would be addressed administratively to prevent similar situations in the future. In summary, the incident was caused by the inoperative keypad entry system, which raised safety concerns. The process involved the Flight Attendant reporting the issue, maintenance being contacted, and the Captain confirming the lack of emergency access. The result was a ""Did Not Fly"" action and aircraft delay, with the Flight Attendant advocating for future administrative corrections to address the safety concern.","safety related, crew-related issues, equipment malfunction, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

She confirmed it was clear and I requested permission to start the number two engine from the Ramp Agent.  He pointed to the number two engine and gave the engine start signal.  A normal start was completed.  The First Officer completed the weight and balance form while I completed the CG.  The First Officer signed the paperwork and handed it to the Flight Attendant who closed the cabin door. I looked out to the Ramp Agent and requested permission to start the number one engine.  The ramp agent pointed to the number one engine and gave me the start engine signal.  I began to start the number one engine.  After a normal engine start; the Flight Attendant began to rapidly knock on the flight deck door.  As soon as the door was opened I heard the engine noise in the cabin and realized that the cabin door was still open.  I immediately shut the number one engine down.  I again looked up at the warning lights and did not see the passenger door light on.  It was not until I moved my hand to block the incoming sun light that I was able to see the warning light. The event occurred due to an environmental issue.  The aircraft was parked roughly facing to the west/south west.  The sun was still low on the horizon and shining through the First Officer's side window and onto the warning/caution panel.  As I scanned the warning lights I did not realize the sun was causing the passenger door light to be unreadable.  Had I seen the passenger door light on; I would not have requested permission to start the engine.  According to the Flight Attendant; while the First Officer and I were completing the weight and balance; the Gate Agent removed and stowed the prop tie.  He then proceeded to walk away from the aircraft.  When we completed the paper work and handed it to the Flight Attendant; there was no one by the door to give the paper work to; nor was there anyone to help her close the door.  Once we began starting the engine; she moved away from the door and began knocking on the flight deck door.  I do not know why the Ramp Agent gave me the OK to start the engine with the door open.  After shutting the engine down; Gate Agent came back up to the aircraft and took the paper work from the Flight Attendant.  The Gate Agent stated that he thought someone else had already collected the paper work.  The door was closed and the engine was restarted.  The remainder of the flight was uneventful.,,,,A DHC-8 Captain started the left engine with the passenger door still open.,"The incident occurred during the pre-flight procedures of a DHC-8 aircraft. The Captain requested permission to start the number one engine after completing the weight and balance paperwork. However, the passenger door warning light was unreadable due to sunlight reflecting on the panel, and the Captain did not notice the door was open. The Flight Attendant noticed the door was open and knocked on the flight deck door to alert the crew. The Captain immediately shut down the engine. The Gate Agent, who had earlier removed and stowed the prop tie, returned to the aircraft and collected the paperwork, allowing the door to be properly closed. The engine was restarted, and the remainder of the flight proceeded without further issues. The incident was attributed to an environmental factor (sunlight) and the absence of ground personnel monitoring the door after collecting the paperwork.","between attendant and crew, weather related, operational issues"

Spoke to the Purser about this because there had been no information for passenger on oxygen on our briefing sheet. Later a passenger service representative boarded; letting us know that; indeed; we would have a passenger on oxygen. Fortunately; the agent had seen the passenger in the boarding area and saw that the passenger would not be using a nasal cannula but a trachea cannula instead. Everything on the aircraft had been incorrectly set up for a nasal cannula.  The agent redid the hoses and explained how to change the tanks.  The passenger was with his family and a paramedic in the boarding area but the paramedic was not allowed to board per a TSA officer even though the Captain had allowed it.  So; five minutes before departure the passenger is hastily boarded; along with his wife and 2 daughters who are traveling with him. I am given no additional/further medical information and am trying to communicate with people who speak limited English. One of the daughters questions me if the flight goes all the way to Vietnam. I tell her the flight number does but that everyone needs to deplane in VHHH. She becomes worried and says her father needs to stay on the oxygen and that they had been told that they wouldn't have to deplane. She makes a quick phone call and I speak to the Doctor. She is concerned about the VHHH stop because they had NOT been told about this. I assured them that they would have oxygen in VHHH and that everything was already taken care of because the computer booking would have alerted someone that this wasn't a nonstop flight. The doors were already closed at this time so I told the daughter that we would follow through and confirm with VHHH later on during the flight. I spoke with the Purser about this and we both felt it was important to follow up with VHHH because everything else related to our passenger had been very unorganized and mismanaged. Luckily; we had a Flight Attendant that spoke Vietnamese.  I asked her to speak to the family after takeoff and reassure them that the oxygen would have already been prearranged in VHHH.  Later; when the Vietnamese literate Flight Attendant was on her break; our passenger needed to use the bathroom.  I tried to communicate with the family to see how long he could be without oxygen and I couldn't really get a straight answer because of the language barrier. I erred on the side of caution and we strapped a portable oxygen bottle around the daughter who was assisting her father to the bathroom. The Purser had communicated to the cockpit the need for verification that we would have oxygen for the passenger in VHHH. Eventually; the cockpit received a message that the passenger had been advised in their PNR that there would be no oxygen in VHHH!!!!! And if they need it; it would be $250 USD. The Vietnamese speaker spoke to the family and they became a bit upset because here we are getting close to landing and we are making last minute arrangements for oxygen. Upon landing someone comes down the aisle with an aisle wheel chair and no oxygen. I had to forcefully let them know our passenger could not be moved without oxygen. The Purser; myself and a few of the economy flight attendants stayed on board for 40 minutes with the passenger and his family while company customer service representatives explained to the family that the price of the oxygen would be around $500 USD!!!!! This was due to the cost of a Doctor or Nurse needing to be there and there was a minimum charge for a set number of hours. The family became very distressed. The father was on his deathbed and this was his last flight so he could die in Vietnam and they had been given wrong information. It was devastating for us to see how poorly this family had been treated by our Company. More importantly; it was dangerous that someone didn't follow throughproperly. This family was basically shoved on the airplane without proper medical information ever being gathered and placed in his computer record and communicated to the crew.  Subsequently; the paramedic should have been allowed to board.  By to let the paramedic board; important medical information was not able to be conveyed to the crew due to the language barrier.,,,,A Purser relates her concerns about the services provided a passenger traveling with special medical needs.,"The incident involved a passenger with critical medical needs who required a trachea cannula, necessitating specialized oxygen equipment. Initially, the flight attendant noticed the oxygen setup was incorrectly configured for a nasal cannula. A passenger service representative corrected this, but the paramedic accompanying the passenger was denied boarding, despite the Captain's permission. The family was hastily boarded just five minutes before departure, with inadequate communication about the stop in VHHH, leading to confusion and distress when they discovered the additional cost of $500 for oxygen. The flight crew, facing language barriers, attempted to ensure the passenger's safety but ultimately found themselves in a dire situation upon landing, where oxygen was unavailable without payment. The lack of proper communication and documentation exacerbated the crisis, highlighting systemic failures in handling medical emergencies and communication. The crew's efforts to assist were hindered by poor coordination and insufficient information, leaving the family in a perilous and emotionally traumatic situation.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, emergency, operational issues, equipment malfunction, health and medical issues, communication issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers, between attendant and other people"

My flying partner was behind me in the cabin and I assumed she would arm both upper deck doors as I disposed of the glasses and cleaned and secured the galley in preparation for departure. I was not aware that she had left the upper deck.  After the safety video was finished I checked the cabin; closing some sidewall bins checking seats and seatbelts and instructing a few passengers seated by the exits to open the window shades. I double checked the galley then sat in my jumpseat and fastened my seatbelt. My flying partner was still back in the galley area at this point and I asked her to double check to make sure the window shades by the exit were open. After take-off I noticed the window shades were still down so I went up to her jumpseat and quietly told her why the window shades had to be open. She said she forgot; then she thanked me for arming the doors for take off. I looked up at the door and was horrified to see it was not armed and the other door was also disarmed.  We armed the doors and I reported it to the cockpit and the purser. Full staffing for the upper deck is two flight attendants--one committed to the aisle; the other in the galley. It is hard work in the best of circumstances and doubly so when one attendant is not working at 100%. In this particular situation I realized in the first few minutes of working together before passenger boarding that I would be doing much of her work in addition to all of mine. This proved to be the case when passengers started to board.  While organizing the galley; talking with the cockpit crew regarding meals and security I was also hanging coats; stowing luggage in the closet and serving predeparture beverages. By the time the 'prepare for departure' announcement was made it seemed like I was going in 10 different directions. The door at upper deck right was my assignment. I did the preflight safety check according to the manual when I boarded and it was my responsibility to either arm the door for departure or make sure it was armed. I failed to do this on this day. I can assure you I double checked the door was disarmed upon arrival at our destination; armed for our departure home and disarmed after our arrival.,,,,A B747-400 flight attendant assumed her flying partner would arm her assigned emergency exit when she was busy with other duties.  So did her flying partner.  The flight took off with two exits disarmed.,"The incident involved two flight attendants on a B747-400 aircraft who both assumed their responsibilities for arming the emergency exit doors were covered by the other. During predeparture preparations, one flight attendant was focused on cleaning and securing the galley, while the other was assisting with passenger seating and safety checks. Neither ensured the doors were armed, leading to the aircraft taking off with both upper deck doors disarmed. Upon realizing the mistake, they armed the doors, informed the cockpit, and completed the flight safely. The flight attendant later reflected on the need for clearer communication and task allocation to prevent such oversights in the future.","crew-related issues, operational issues, between attendant and crew"

The aircraft was a non-bunk airplane and has two first class seats for pilot rest and coach seats for flight attendant rest.  After stowing my bags above the flight crew rest seats I proceeded to the cockpit and the Captain handed me the window shades for the cockpit and told me to find a place to store them as he did not have enough room in the closet in the cockpit.  I went to the pilot designated storage areas above the flight crew rest seats and did not find any room to store the shades.  I then attempted to return to the cockpit and found the galley Flight Attendant trying to store her bags in the closet aft of the cockpit.  I was waiting for her to finish so I could return to the cockpit and put the window shades under the second observers seat.  While waiting the galley Flight Attendant looked up and said; 'those won't fit in my closet'; referring to the shades.  I said; 'I don't want to put them in there'.  Still waiting she said; 'You didn't hear me; those won't fit in my closet!'  I said; 'Again; I don't want to put them in YOUR closet.'  She finally was finished and I secured the shades in the cockpit.  The other relief pilot asked what happened because the galley Flight Attendant said; 'I hope he doesn't plan on eating tonight.'  This is a 13+ hour flight and I wanted to try and address the issue with the galley Flight Attendant.  As I went to the galley to speak with her another Flight Attendant said; 'You better not push her buttons; she controls your food!'

At one point Purser walked away from Captain during a conversation involving safety issues. During layover; Captain made decision to replace Purser with another Flight Attendant. Captain ordered initial Purser to work in coach (or at least not as Purser) but the Purser refused to follow Captain's orders.  Captain and First Officers agreed we could not work with this Flight Attendant and requested that a Flight Operations Manager remove him from flight. Ultimately; the remaining flight attendants wanted to walk if Purser was removed from aircraft. All agreed that they felt the Captain was unsafe if Purser was removed.  Pilot talked to the Flight Operations Manager on a conference call and decided to allow Purser to fly as passenger. Purser agreed to ride as passenger. Flight Attendants never recanted on their reference to the unsafe feature regarding the Captain. Second Purser took over. Northbound flight was uneventful.

The issue escalated when the Purser, a senior cabin crew member, refused to comply with the Captain's orders, leading to a decision by the Captain and First Officers to request the removal of the Purser from the flight. This decision was met with resistance from other flight attendants, who expressed concerns about the Captain's safety if the Purser was removed. After a conference call with the Flight Operations Manager, it was agreed that the Purser would fly as a passenger on the remainder of the journey rather than continue in his role. The remaining flight attendants maintained their stance that they could not work safely under the Captain's authority if the Purser was removed. The flight resumed without further issues, with the second Purser taking over duties.

He once again stated that they don't have Maintenance here. I then asked him 'What if we have a problem in the back of the aircraft.' He replied 'I can hear you so I can click once for yes and twice for no.' I realized later how foolish I was not to have walked off the plane at that time.

As I approached the runway; my First Officer advised the Tower that we needed 10 more seconds.  Tower told us to hold short; but I was unable to stop the aircraft before about 5 feet of the nose was past the hold short line.  Tower called to have us read back the hold short instructions; which I did as the First Officer was now asking the Flight Attendant if she was ready for takeoff.  She said that she was and that she thought that she had chimed us.  During this time; I was talking to Tower to tell them that we were in fact beyond the hold short line.

The gate Agent gave us a loadsheet showing 51 Passengers.  The fuel audit checked and all the numbers added correctly.  The head Flight Attendant gave us a napkin which also had 51 Passengers.  The takeoff and climb were all normal.  During our climb one of the Flight Attendants rang us and said the passenger count was 81.  I asked her to verify the count two more times.  She still said the count was 81 not 51. The First Officer adjusted the zero fuel weight by adding 5;800 lbs to the FMC to account for 30 Passenger error.  Upon arrival I called Operations and spoke to a Supervisor.  He asked what revision number was on my loadsheet and I replied Revision zero.  He informed me the loadsheet was revised three times and it was closed out at 81 Passengers.  So the error occurred when the Agent gave us the original loadsheet which was incorrect and the Flight Attendant did not actually perform a passenger count but instead went off the loadsheet. I spoke with the Flight Attendants and informed them how important it is to actually perform the count to crosscheck the Agent's number.,,The 'perfect storm' of two compound errors led to this event. A correct count by the Flight Attendants would have allowed us to catch the error on the loading schedule. Flight Attendants need to understand the importance of an accurate Passenger count; that it is not just a 'nice-to-know' number on a napkin.

The ground personnel provided a loadsheet stating 51 passengers, but the actual count was 81. The flight attendants did not verify the count and relied on the loadsheet. During the climb, the discrepancy was noticed, prompting the crew to adjust the zero fuel weight. However, the loadsheet had been revised three times without proper communication.

I continued to perform my duties to the best of my abilities during boarding and takeoff. After the boarding door was closed I was asked by the flight crew if I was alright. I told them I didn't know but I thought I would be okay & able to perform my duties. After the safety demo was done; I went to the lavatory where I dealt with vomiting & diarrhea. I was experiencing unbearable stomach cramps also. I had to go to the lav at least every 5 or so minutes. I got a call from the captain and was asked how I was doing. I told him I wasn't doing well at all and wouldn't be able to do an inflight service. I was asked if we needed to make an emergency landing. I told him I thought I could at least make it to our destination. After that phone call; I had to go back to the lav. At that point in time I was very weak & dizzy and couldn't make it back up to my jumpseat. So I retreated to the nearest seat. I left my jumpseat out the entire flight to create some sort of barrier between the cabin and the flight deck. A passenger came up to me and told me he was a former EMT & wanted to take my vital signs. He said I wasn't in the best shape but I would be okay. I asked him to call the flight deck and let them know what was going on with me. He then returned and told me we were about 30 minutes out from our destination and we would be landing soon. Once we landed; EMTs boarded the aircraft and assisted me into the terminal via wheelchair. My vital signs were taken and I told them the symptoms of how I was feeling. They told me it sounded like I had food poisoning and there wasn't much they or a hospital could do for me. They advised against going to the hospital. I was contacted by my manager and crew scheduling. I was told I was taken off my trip and my manager had me go to the airport clinic to be evaluated. The doctor at the clinic diagnosed me with food poisoning and told me not to fly anywhere that night or the next morning. He also said there was nothing he could prescribe me and that the illness would have to run its course. The next time I am ill to the point of not being able to perform my duties and I know well ahead of time I will definitely call crew scheduling and my manager and let them know immediately. I will also get to some sort of urgent care facility as quickly as possible. I should have called as soon as I started showing signs of illness. I understand also that it is a major problem with me being the only flight attendant on duty and not being able to be in the proper state of mind and body to effectively perform my duties.,,Flight Attendant got progressively sicker during flight to the point of a passenger needing to help fill in for her duties. I briefed the First Officer on the situation and he had heard some of it. I said we needed to find in the FOM/POM reference to flight attendant incapacitation. I could find no reference in POM index for flight attendant or incapacitation. First Officer eventually found it.I told her if she was not feeling well or felt worse to brief a passenger on the use of the interphone and have them contact the flight deck. ... with approximately 50 minutes left in the flight at FL340 I received an interphone call from the cabin from a passenger on board saying the flight attendant was ill. He identified himself as a pilot and EMT. I asked the status of our Flight Attendant and he said she was conscious with a good pulse and good breathing and aside from being sick to the stomach had good vitals.I briefed the passenger initially on the interphone use and if a chime was heard pick up the phone and if her condition changed to call us ... At some point I went in the back and briefed the EMT that if he believed the flight attendant could not adequate perform her duties to relocate the her to a passenger seat and that he needed to sit in the FA jumpseat per FOM 'Flight Attendant Incapacitation' procedures. He accepted and I briefed him on opening the door stowing the Flight Attendant jumpseat upon arrival at the gate and going over securing the cabin for arrival.,,A CRJ900 flight crew must make difficult decisions when the sole flight attendant aboard is incapacitated by food poisoning.,"A flight attendant on a CRJ900 aircraft became incapacitated due to food poisoning, which manifested with symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, and severe cramps. Despite initial attempts to continue her duties, her condition deteriorated, leading her to inform the captain she could not perform her responsibilities. The captain, referencing company procedures (FOM), coordinated with a passenger who was an EMT to monitor her condition and take appropriate actions. The flight landed safely, with the EMT assisting in securing the cabin and moving the flight attendant to a passenger seat. Upon deplaning, she was evaluated by EMTs and later at an airport clinic, diagnosed with food poisoning, and advised against flying. The incident highlighted the importance of early communication with crew scheduling and seeking timely medical assistance.","safety related, crew-related issues, passenger-related issues, operational issues, health and medical issues, between attendant and crew, between attendant and passengers"
